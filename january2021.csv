Hello r/mm!

Here today to just sell my set of GMK Cafe and the Enter RAMA. Bought these both a few months back on the aftermarket and have not been using them at all, so it's time to let them go for my cost. Prices are as listed below, and all negotiable.

**~~GMK Cafe Base~~** ~~(New, never mounted) - $300 USD shipped in trays. Plastic has been cut to see if there were any defects. Has not been used at all.~~ ***SOLD FOR ASKING***

**GMK Cafe RAMA Enter (Preparer)** \- $230 USD shipped ($200 if bundled with base). Was mounted for 5 minutes where I realized I would rather use the cream accent enter from the base.

Prices in USD. Shipping refers to CONUS USA maybe a coupla bucks more for HI or AK. I need a sizeable additional financial incentive to ship outside of the US right now. Not exactly FCFS as bundles are way easier. I’m in Houston, local is cheaper. I probably won't see reddit chat as quick as a PM and I've sold stuff to the second person before because I dont see chat. Post something in the thread before you write me so I know you're not pathofexile. If my price is bad, cite your source (the same price hasn't sold in weeks, etc) and tell me. Do I want anything for trade? Probably not? but it doesn't bother me if you ask.

Hey guys, hope y’all are safe and healthy!

I have the following sets for sale, prices do not include shipping.

I am looking to donate some cash from this sale to a local cat rescuer, can view her instagram at [.@fioloh](https://www.instagram.com/fioloh/?hl=en). She has been helping many stray cats/dogs (mainly cats) find homes, seek medical help (including surgeries) as well as helping to foster. I found her work really meaningful (especially because I like cats). Hence, I'll state 2 prices (just $10 difference), if you would like to help, you can opt to purchase the slightly more expensive price, it's perfectly okay if you don't want to. The donation will be publicly recorded at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asY5BAWSZ_pmxUy2jxmaSa1eHDddTiLQlEhGi1niuyw/edit#gid=1722981492), under tehbingg. I'll update here once donated. (I hope this is allowed by the mods, otherwise please let me know, I'll be willing to remove.)

&#x200B;

This would not be FCFS as I would like to prioritize the donation prices to help a little more.

|Space 65 R1|Black with LED option. Barely used. No scuffs, scratches, or gouges. Flawless. Board was built using gray badge, CF plate, Zeal stabs, and 67g Zealios. Stabs are lubed with GH V4 and Zealios are lubed with Tribosys 3203. Also includes brass badge (never used), brass plate (never used), and extra PCB (never used). LEDs on installed PCB stopped working (not uncommon on space65). Also, the brass plate is a hair too thick. You can grind it down a little to get it thin enough for the case to screw closed without any gaps. Quite a number of people in the R1 GB had the same problem (check GB thread on GH).|$600|

Hi! Recently I've moved to 40% ortholinear keyboards with Workman layout so I'm going to sell all other stuff that I don't use anymore.

The prices don't include the shipping, I can ship worldwide, you'll decide the shipping type/company. Please consider that if you chose to ship with Royal Mail I'll need to go to the Post Office and **UK at the moment is in lock-down** so I'll try to wait for more than one shipment before to go to the post office to avoid as many trips as possible.

I live in **South East London** so if you want to pass by to collect it and to pay cash is fine by me.

If you want more/better/different pictures please send me a PM.

**If you buy more than a product we can arrange a discount.**

Comment before PM, thanks.

30,Neal_Stephenson,1611519771.0,/r/mechmarket/comments/l46siu/usny_h_sa_laser_gmk_olive_gmk_metropolis_gmk/,"Saving up to propose and need to trim the fat everywhere, my untouched mech collection getting the first round of layoffs :(. Need to be more realistic with what I use on a daily basis unfortunately. Not sure if the SO will be more thrilled by the proposal or the lack of stacked boxes in every nook and cranny of a way too small nyc apt but here goes!

Shipping (**US only**): USPS tracked and **insured** flat rate $10 for Keycaps, $5 for deskmat and $20 for Keyboards. Post office near me has very limited COVID hours right now so shipping might not be as snappy as usual but will make as fast as possible.

Keycaps are **untouched** and **sealed** (except for SA Laser which is untouched and unused but in baggies).

**NOT SPLITTING UP SETS** so pm'ing to ask is not going to do anything, sorry but it seems to be near impossible to make this clear. Offers are welcome but not planning to stray too far and not in a rush or anything. Thanks for understanding :).

Please comment before PM'ing and feel free to ask any questions aside from the above very clear rules and sorry only selling not trading.

Apologies if responses are bit slow I am working at the moment but I will get back to you!

A few notes on boards:

**E8.5:** completely unused, received finally recently only removed from original packaging to take pictures. Just didn't end up being my form factor after ordering a long time ago. Package details:

* Layout: WKL
* PCB (2): Solder and Hotswap
* Top Color: E Black
* Bottom Color: E Black
* Plate Color (2): Titanium and E Yellow
* Accent Colors(2): PVD Silver and E Yellow
* Side Weight Colors(2): E Black and E Yellow
* Middle Gasket Mount: Yes
* Inner Middle: E Black

&#x200B;

**Think 6.5 R1:** Polycarb no front badge, comes with extra hotswap pcb and alternate black rear badge. Built but never used, couple of things to note. 4 screws are missing from bottom, the middle 4 as they never came with the order, these can easily be replaced I just have not done so as they don't really effect anything. No issues or blemishes with board and comes soldered with Gateron Inks switch filmed and lubed with 205g0.

**CA66**: this one is really killing me to give up, built and used but only slightly as it never made the daily rotation. Dark grey with gold badge HHKB style with bluetooth including installed almost unused 3.7V 3000mAh 595085 Li-ion Rechargeable Lithium Polymer Li-Po Battery as well as installed Brass plate. Switches are harvested Vintage Blacks, switch filmed and lubed with 205g0. There are a few cosmetic defects only noticeable one is on the back as seen in pictures, as well as a slight one on the front forward face.

  &nbsp;

I've finally got my preferences dialed in and no longer need these extras. I want to sell them quickly and the prices are a little low to reflect that. CONUS only please! Please note that the prices do not reflect shipping costs, we'll estimate that if you decide to buy something. Not FCFS as I'll be offering big discounts for bulk buyers.   
  
&nbsp;

The Rama and Tofu are in ""good"" condition and the EO-87 is essentially pristine. The EO-87 and M65-A are soldered and the tofu is hotswap, I won't be de-soldering anything so this is an ""as-is"" sort of thing. All keycap sets have been used a fair amount so a little bit of shine can be expected on all except perhaps the Delta and Infinikey sets.   
  
  &nbsp;
  
Comment here and then send a PM please, all chats will be ignored. Thanks for reading!

I have for sale couple of items:

**GK61 Aluminum Version (hotswappable) - $110 shipped**

\- barely used, these feel super good with my mauves but im looking to get a Gmk BoW or WoB

&#x200B;

**~~GMK Oblivion r2~~** \- Looking for trades but if you must buy take it for $305 shipped in bags.

They have no shine (can take better pics of keycaps upon request). modifiers have around 1-2 weeks use and the rest have almost no use

&#x200B;

KAT MIlkshake Ortho - Looking to trade for modifiers or anything else. Dont really know how much these go for so if you must buy i guess I can let it go for $120. Dm me to discuss further about trades tho!

[Timestamp!](https://imgur.com/gallery/sP2u5ZO)

Had some free time on my hand so I managed to lube a bunch of the switches I had on hand. I've been lubing switches and posting them on MM over the past 6 months or so, so the quality has been pretty consistent. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions on the methods I use.

All switches are new, never mounted/soldered. Willing to break up the packs and sell in w/e quantity you would like.

Also got a few boards I need to offload due to jumping in on a few GBs. As always, prices are all obo, so please feel free to reach out if you believe my prices are unreasonable.

Want to sell my Cafe rama enter keycap. It is opened, mounted for a week then put back in bag. Im selling it because I don't think it really matches well with the base kit. Maybe if you have some dark alphas it would go pretty well with that.

|Bauer R1 Alu|$2050|This was originally an A-stock board configured as a silver top, grey plate, grey base. Unfortunately, some of the cerakote “rubbed off” in transit due to friction between the silver and the packaging materials. I had it cerakoted to be all black, including the alu plate. There is one surface-level mark (would be easily fixed with another cerakote job) visible on the right side of the board - would not say it is visible in use, but not everyone’s set up is the same, so YMMV. Currently built with a millmaxed PCB + Gateron Ink V1s lubed with 205g0 by AshKeebs. If you wish, I can include the switches + the caps (oblivion monochrome, hagoromo alphas) at no additional cost. This will include 1 additional PCB and any of the extra plates (PC, POM, brass) in the photo album will be available at no extra charge, subject to availability.  I would prefer to allow one buyer to grab PC OR POM, and not both, so both can experience a softer typing experience if they wish to do so.|[https://imgur.com/a/NErSTo8](https://imgur.com/a/NErSTo8)|
|~~Bauer R1 Alu + Brass~~|~~$2000~~ \- sold for $1850 shipped to /u/mmoutgalias|~~Grey top, grey alu plate, brass base. From the B-stock raffle. The only imperfections I can see are some cerakote  flaws (you can see some surface-level scratches in “bad” light at specific angles - I apologize for the lack of photos as it is hard to pick up on camera), as well as some interior machining marks on the brass bottom. This will include 2 PCBs and any of the extra plates (PC, POM, brass) in the photo album will be available at no extra charge, subject to availability.

Hey MM, I have a few things I am getting rid of since I sold a few boards and need to pay off some bills. I won't be using these items for a while so I might as well sell them to someone that will put them to good use.

Not FCFS. Priority goes to bundles. What you see in the timestamps are the exact items you will be getting.

**Locals: Bay Area**

**I will only ship CONUS at this time.** **Prices include shipping and Signature Required via USPS**. Since it is the holidays, it is better to be safe

Hey guys, 

Looking to let go of Dualshot. Not FCFS as I'll give some priority to entire bundle or people who've been after certain kits for awhile. I'm OBO (only lower) on these and would likely take a lower price if we've talked/traded frequently in the past. 

Listed prices for anything on sale include Paypal fees and USPS First Class or Priority shipping within the US. If you'd like to use another method, let me know.

Hey there everyone, hope you're doing well

Today I have a few boards I'd like to put up for trade/sale considering they don't see too much use and would be better suited to someone else.

**PLEASE READ** -  I will be unable to ship ANY ITEMS until January 12th at the absolute earliest. Please keep this in mind when inquiring about trades or otherwise. 


Item | Description| Want
---|---|----
FMJ80| Black WKL. Currently built with Gerry's (cherry housing + gat yellow stem + 68g SPRiT slows lubed with 3204 and 105 on springs) on an alum half plate. The case is in good condition with a very slight ding on the right side above the left arrow key. Comes with USB converter. Can desolder if preferred. Keycaps not included. | $1250 OBO, Trades
Kokua| Grey. Currently unbuilt. Kit includes 3 PCBs ( a twice desoldered ProjectKB pcb that is fully functional (USB Mini), hotswap USB-C Sneakbox PCB, and a brand new Mechlovin PCB (USB-mini)). Also comes with three plates: brass, red aluminum, and 3/4 Hiney FR4. Please see the following images for slight issues with the finish https://i.imgur.com/f9GGzjJ.jpg https://i.imgur.com/jojLOYv.jpg. | Sold for $750 (1 PCB + 1 Plate)
KMAC v1| Silver. Currently built with lubed (3204) retooled blacks and 65g TX springs on a full aluminum plate. Keycaps not included. Still not 100% whether or not I'll let this go. | ~~$650 OBO, trades~~ Sold for asking
[ALF DC60](https://imgur.com/a/9OhYubE)| E White. Currently built with Alpacas (lubed with 3204) on an alum full plate and lubed Zeal stabs. The case is in very good condition with a very slight ding on the left side near the shift/caps lock key. Including PBT muted (purchased from flashquark) as pictured in the build, but will include the remainder of the kit too. Will include a steel full plate and a PCB that currently will not connect due to a loose USB-C connector (I believe it just needs solder added to the joint, but I'm no expert). Also due to 3m tape wrapped around the plate/pcb the left control has very slight stick if pressed down aggressively, but you can always remove the tape. Ships in original box.| ~~$200 shipped OBO~~ Sold for $170
[Lubrigante](https://imgur.com/a/sVIbnYm)| Built with 205g0 lubed NK blueberries on a wonderland PCB. Some flaws: To disclose some of the flaws: I lost two of the original stand-offs for the screws. I found ones that fit into the cutouts for the standoffs, but they're slightly longer than the ones provided with the kit originally. They fit more snug, so it's not that much of an issue. [These photos](https://imgur.com/a/5nv6yxi) from the original owner also show that he had to install wires to bridge some switches. The switches that are affected are H and right B, as he accidentally ripped a trace during a desoldering. With the wires, the keys work just fine. No sticker(s) are on the bottom now| ~~$180 shipped OBO~~ Sold for asking
| GMK 8008 | Used base kit and obscure kit (used lightly for approximately 1 month) | ~~$280 shipped~~ Sold for $250

For trades I'm primarily interested in some TKLs and a select few 60% boards. KFE (yes, I know, but I really like silver), FLX Virgo, or a 456GT or Koala (lol). I could be persuaded to trade something for a Kei as well (prefer SE if anyone is looking to get rid of one). Also looking for OG dyesubs should someone be looking to get rid of theirs. 

If you have something else interesting feel free to offer away, the worst I can say is no :) Also, we can discuss adding paypal on either end of the trade if necessary. 

Feel free to ask any questions or request further images :)

Not FCFS. Will get shipped out as I am able, as mentioned above.

Thanks for looking, and as always please leave a comment before you PM.

EDIT - may fall asleep soon! I'll respond to messages in the morning as I am able",sold gmk oblivion bundle to u/joshdoit1110,"[US-NC] [H] FMJ80, Kōkua, KMACv1, ALF DC60, Lubrigante, GMK 8008 [W] Paypal, Trades"

Hey guys, hope y’all are safe and healthy!

I have the following sets for sale, prices do not include shipping.

I am looking to donate some cash from this sale to a local cat rescuer, can view her instagram at [.@fioloh](https://www.instagram.com/fioloh/?hl=en). She has been helping many stray cats/dogs (mainly cats) find homes, seek medical help (including surgeries) as well as helping to foster. I found her work really meaningful (especially because I like cats). Hence, I'll state 2 prices (just $10 difference), if you would like to help, you can opt to purchase the slightly more expensive price, it's perfectly okay if you don't want to. The donation will be publicly recorded at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asY5BAWSZ_pmxUy2jxmaSa1eHDddTiLQlEhGi1niuyw/edit#gid=1722981492), under tehbingg. I'll update here once donated. (I hope this is allowed by the mods, otherwise please let me know, I'll be willing to remove.)

&#x200B;

This would not be FCFS as I would like to prioritize the donation prices to help a little more.

**SHIPPING CONUS ONLY**

Hi Guys, Happy new year!! Im local to NYC and can deliver tonight only for free! (if youre not too far)

I have for sale couple of items:

**GK61 Aluminum Version (hotswappable) - $110 shipped**

\- My first custom keyboard! Very friendly beginner keyboard because you get to test out many switches on an aluminum board. Comes with lubed and modded stabs.  The plate has some marks from using the switch remover. Combine this the the holy pandas for $5 off

**~~Drop Holy panda v2s with Super lube 51004 x67 - $75 shipped in bags~~**

\- Tactiles arent for me, but hope to find a good home for these! can include 3 stock holy pandas as well.

**~~GMK Dualshot - $315 shipped in trays~~** **SOLD FOR ASKING**

**-** Mounted once for pics. These looks so good in person. Sadly, need to fund other groupbuys

**~~NovelKeys WoB~~** ~~- $70 shipped in original packaging~~**SOLD FOR ASKING**

\- barely used, these feel super good with my mauves but im looking to get a Gmk BoW or WoB

&#x200B;

**~~GMK Oblivion r2~~** \- Looking for trades but if you must buy take it for $305 shipped in bags.

They have no shine (can take better pics of keycaps upon request). modifiers have around 1-2 weeks use and the rest have almost no use

&#x200B;

KAT MIlkshake Ortho - Looking to trade for modifiers or anything else. Dont really know how much these go for so if you must buy i guess I can let it go for $120. Dm me to discuss further about trades tho!

&#x200B;

Will take off $6 for each item bundled! Prioritizing local > highest confirmed trades > else

Hey guys, hope y’all are safe and healthy!

I have the following sets for sale, prices do not include shipping.

I am looking to donate some cash from this sale to a local cat rescuer, can view her instagram at [.@fioloh](https://www.instagram.com/fioloh/?hl=en). She has been helping many stray cats/dogs (mainly cats) find homes, seek medical help (including surgeries) as well as helping to foster. I found her work really meaningful (especially because I like cats). Hence, I'll state 2 prices (just $10 difference), if you would like to help, you can opt to purchase the slightly more expensive price, it's perfectly okay if you don't want to. The donation will be publicly recorded at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asY5BAWSZ_pmxUy2jxmaSa1eHDddTiLQlEhGi1niuyw/edit#gid=1722981492), under tehbingg. I'll update here once donated. (I hope this is allowed by the mods, otherwise please let me know, I'll be willing to remove.)

&#x200B;

I have for sale couple of items:

**GK61 Aluminum Version (hotswappable) - $110 shipped**

\- My first custom keyboard! Very friendly beginner keyboard because you get to test out many switches on an aluminum board. Comes with lubed and modded stabs.  The plate has some marks from using the switch remover. Combine this the the holy pandas for $5 off

**~~Drop Holy panda v2s with Super lube 51004 x67 - $75 shipped in bags~~**

\- Tactiles arent for me, but hope to find a good home for these! can include 3 stock holy pandas as well.

**~~GMK Dualshot - $315 shipped in trays~~** **SOLD FOR ASKING**

**-** Mounted once for pics. These looks so good in person. Sadly, need to fund other groupbuys

**~~NovelKeys WoB~~** ~~- $70 shipped in original packaging~~**SOLD FOR ASKING**

\- barely used, these feel super good with my mauves but im looking to get a Gmk BoW or WoB

&#x200B;

**~~GMK Oblivion r2~~** \- Looking for trades but if you must buy take it for $305 shipped in bags.

They have no shine (can take better pics of keycaps upon request). modifiers have around 1-2 weeks use and the rest have almost no use

&#x200B;

KAT MIlkshake Ortho - Looking to trade for modifiers or anything else. Dont really know how much these go for so if you must buy i guess I can let it go for $120. Dm me to discuss further about trades tho!

Hi, friends. I've replaced mechanical keyboards with newer hobbies over the years. Trying to find loving homes the keyboards, keysets, and artisans I'm now neglecting. As always, PM before commenting.

Priority to those buying multiple items. Prices include shipping to CONUS. Keysets ship in bags. Extra costs for international shipping.

All artisans have MX stems. Also - I'd prefer to keep the JK Constellation Series as a set.

Thanks!

Getting rid of old stock. 

I prefer Paypal but am open to trades. **NOT** FCFS. *DMing me with Paypal email and buying for asking price guarantees you the item.* I am happy to provide more pics if you need them. 

Each item you bundle together **reduces the price by $5** since I don't have to pay for double shipping!

Prices include shipping to CONUS. I'm only shipping to the US at the moment because of our post office situation right now. Sorry about that. 

**Please PM, don't send a chat message. If you send a chat message I will not respond to it for 24 hours. Please comment before PM.**

Looking  to see what I could get in trades for my KBD8X. I love this board, it  feels and sounds amazing. It is fully built on a soldered PCB with lubed  creams and GMK stabs. Both have been lubed with 205g0. There is evo foam under the pcb as well. Aside from the brass weight needing a little bit of a  clean, it is in incredible condition. I am thinking of getting rid of it  because I am realizing that I prefer smaller form factor boards.

I  am mainly looking for a higher end 60/65% board either built or  unbuilt. I am happy to hear all offers, and am willing to throw in extra  money on top depending on the trade. Please comment before PM'ing.",sold gmk oblivion hagoromo base set to u/genuous,[US-AZ] [H] Built WKL KBD8X [W] Trades

Looking to get rid of some items that I no longer use. 

•KBD67 - $200 shipped. Comes with a preinstalled brass plate, and will also include an extra alum plate. This has a hot swap pcb, and all sockets are working. There is case foam below the pcb, and lubed (205g0) zeal stabs all around. THIS IS A SPLIT BACKSPACE SETUP. Only flaw is that two of the bottom case screws do not screw in. I think the threads may have stripped, but should be easily fixable. The case still comes together great and is very secure using the remaining screws. 

•Zealios V2 67g switches - $85 shipped. These have been lubed using 205g0, avoiding the legs. They are still super tactile (a little too tactile for me, which is why I am selling them). 

•SA Calm Depths - $120 shipped. This is a full kit, there are more keys that will be included that are not pictured. There is some shine on the keys, but look great. Will be shipped in bags. 

If anyone is interested in picking up all of the items together, we can work out a deal in terms of pricing.

Hey there everyone, hope you're doing well

Today I have a few boards I'd like to put up for trade/sale considering they don't see too much use and would be better suited to someone else.

**PLEASE READ** -  I will be unable to ship ANY ITEMS until January 12th at the absolute earliest. Please keep this in mind when inquiring about trades or otherwise. 


Item | Description| Want
---|---|----
FMJ80| Black WKL. Currently built with Gerry's (cherry housing + gat yellow stem + 68g SPRiT slows lubed with 3204 and 105 on springs) on an alum half plate. The case is in good condition with a very slight ding on the right side above the left arrow key. Comes with USB converter. Can desolder if preferred. Keycaps not included. | $1250 OBO, Trades
Kokua| Grey. Currently unbuilt. Kit includes 3 PCBs ( a twice desoldered ProjectKB pcb that is fully functional (USB Mini), hotswap USB-C Sneakbox PCB, and a brand new Mechlovin PCB (USB-mini)). Also comes with three plates: brass, red aluminum, and 3/4 Hiney FR4. Please see the following images for slight issues with the finish https://i.imgur.com/f9GGzjJ.jpg https://i.imgur.com/jojLOYv.jpg. | Sold for $750 (1 PCB + 1 Plate)
KMAC v1| Silver. Currently built with lubed (3204) retooled blacks and 65g TX springs on a full aluminum plate. Keycaps not included. Still not 100% whether or not I'll let this go. | ~~$650 OBO, trades~~ Sold for asking
[ALF DC60](https://imgur.com/a/9OhYubE)| E White. Currently built with Alpacas (lubed with 3204) on an alum full plate and lubed Zeal stabs. The case is in very good condition with a very slight ding on the left side near the shift/caps lock key. Including PBT muted (purchased from flashquark) as pictured in the build, but will include the remainder of the kit too. Will include a steel full plate and a PCB that currently will not connect due to a loose USB-C connector (I believe it just needs solder added to the joint, but I'm no expert). Also due to 3m tape wrapped around the plate/pcb the left control has very slight stick if pressed down aggressively, but you can always remove the tape. Ships in original box.| ~~$200 shipped OBO~~ Sold for $170
[Lubrigante](https://imgur.com/a/sVIbnYm)| Built with 205g0 lubed NK blueberries on a wonderland PCB. Some flaws: To disclose some of the flaws: I lost two of the original stand-offs for the screws. I found ones that fit into the cutouts for the standoffs, but they're slightly longer than the ones provided with the kit originally. They fit more snug, so it's not that much of an issue. [These photos](https://imgur.com/a/5nv6yxi) from the original owner also show that he had to install wires to bridge some switches. The switches that are affected are H and right B, as he accidentally ripped a trace during a desoldering. With the wires, the keys work just fine. No sticker(s) are on the bottom now| ~~$180 shipped OBO~~ Sold for asking
| GMK 8008 | Used base kit and obscure kit (used lightly for approximately 1 month) | ~~$280 shipped~~ Sold for $250

For trades I'm primarily interested in some TKLs and a select few 60% boards. KFE (yes, I know, but I really like silver), FLX Virgo, or a 456GT or Koala (lol). I could be persuaded to trade something for a Kei as well (prefer SE if anyone is looking to get rid of one). Also looking for OG dyesubs should someone be looking to get rid of theirs. 

If you have something else interesting feel free to offer away, the worst I can say is no :) Also, we can discuss adding paypal on either end of the trade if necessary. 

Feel free to ask any questions or request further images :)

Not FCFS. Will get shipped out as I am able, as mentioned above.

Thanks for looking, and as always please leave a comment before you PM.

EDIT - may fall asleep soon! I'll respond to messages in the morning as I am able",sold gmk 8008 bundle to u/stanrc,"[US-NC] [H] FMJ80, Kōkua, KMACv1, ALF DC60, Lubrigante, GMK 8008 [W] Paypal, Trades"

**Sold for asking price Volcano 660** I am the original owner, built once. Color is forest green, with copper color PVD brass plate and weight. There's some anodization flaws on the bottom but all the other sides look good to my eye. There is a small ding on the top right above pgup, and a small scratch on the front side, I never noticed this one until taking pics. It's in good condition but not flawless or mint.

The switches are ""Preams"" a switch I ""invented"" and I think a few people have tried out. I wrote a post a while ago here https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/b1wwtj/preams/

These preams are made with pro plum stems, NK Cream housings, 65g Sprit springs, switch films, and 3204 lube (but not directly on the leaf or legs). They basically feel like pro purples, but a touch lighter and sound better IMO. The spacebar is a 205g0 lubed Gat Ink.

The cable is made by Summit Cables, there's about 3.25ft after the coil. Comes with original box. https://imgur.com/a/NDGoVgr **$760** (edit: more pics of bottom with natural light https://imgur.com/a/cGn9te4)

**Sold for asking price GMK DMG R1** Base kit of the first DMG run. It has shine but due to the color of the caps and my artificial lighting I can't get it to show in the pictures. I'd call it a medium amount, it's not full blown but if you don't like the feel and look of shined ABS this one isn't for you. Never mounted on Box switches. Keycaps not pictured on the TX-CP have never been used. https://imgur.com/a/t4h4jwW  **$190**",bought gmk dmg r1 from u/poochzag,"[US-MA] [H] Volcano 660 Forest Green, GMK DMG R1 [W] Paypal"

I bought this a while ago back when I was first starting to get into building my own keyboard but that never progressed so it just sat in the box. I'm now committing to a different build and realized it's going to be expensive so I'll be using the funds from this to build something to get me started. 

Did some research but wasn't really able to find one that was BNIB within the last 6 months. Some used were in the upper mid 300s, others higher but with novelties. That being said, I'm looking for $400 local or $420 shipped to CONUS. Price negotiable if not reasonable, but again, wasn't able to find an exact match. If my pricing is off, please provide links and I'll adjust accordingly.

Hey there everyone, hope you're doing well

Today I have a few boards I'd like to put up for trade/sale considering they don't see too much use and would be better suited to someone else.

**PLEASE READ** -  I will be unable to ship ANY ITEMS until January 12th at the absolute earliest. Please keep this in mind when inquiring about trades or otherwise. 


Item | Description| Want
---|---|----
FMJ80| Black WKL. Currently built with Gerry's (cherry housing + gat yellow stem + 68g SPRiT slows lubed with 3204 and 105 on springs) on an alum half plate. The case is in good condition with a very slight ding on the right side above the left arrow key. Comes with USB converter. Can desolder if preferred. Keycaps not included. | $1250 OBO, Trades
Kokua| Grey. Currently unbuilt. Kit includes 3 PCBs ( a twice desoldered ProjectKB pcb that is fully functional (USB Mini), hotswap USB-C Sneakbox PCB, and a brand new Mechlovin PCB (USB-mini)). Also comes with three plates: brass, red aluminum, and 3/4 Hiney FR4. Please see the following images for slight issues with the finish https://i.imgur.com/f9GGzjJ.jpg https://i.imgur.com/jojLOYv.jpg. | Sold for $750 (1 PCB + 1 Plate)
KMAC v1| Silver. Currently built with lubed (3204) retooled blacks and 65g TX springs on a full aluminum plate. Keycaps not included. Still not 100% whether or not I'll let this go. | ~~$650 OBO, trades~~ Sold for asking
[ALF DC60](https://imgur.com/a/9OhYubE)| E White. Currently built with Alpacas (lubed with 3204) on an alum full plate and lubed Zeal stabs. The case is in very good condition with a very slight ding on the left side near the shift/caps lock key. Including PBT muted (purchased from flashquark) as pictured in the build, but will include the remainder of the kit too. Will include a steel full plate and a PCB that currently will not connect due to a loose USB-C connector (I believe it just needs solder added to the joint, but I'm no expert). Also due to 3m tape wrapped around the plate/pcb the left control has very slight stick if pressed down aggressively, but you can always remove the tape. Ships in original box.| ~~$200 shipped OBO~~ Sold for $170
[Lubrigante](https://imgur.com/a/sVIbnYm)| Built with 205g0 lubed NK blueberries on a wonderland PCB. Some flaws: To disclose some of the flaws: I lost two of the original stand-offs for the screws. I found ones that fit into the cutouts for the standoffs, but they're slightly longer than the ones provided with the kit originally. They fit more snug, so it's not that much of an issue. [These photos](https://imgur.com/a/5nv6yxi) from the original owner also show that he had to install wires to bridge some switches. The switches that are affected are H and right B, as he accidentally ripped a trace during a desoldering. With the wires, the keys work just fine. No sticker(s) are on the bottom now| ~~$180 shipped OBO~~ Sold for asking
| GMK 8008 | Used base kit and obscure kit (used lightly for approximately 1 month) | ~~$280 shipped~~ Sold for $250

For trades I'm primarily interested in some TKLs and a select few 60% boards. KFE (yes, I know, but I really like silver), FLX Virgo, or a 456GT or Koala (lol). I could be persuaded to trade something for a Kei as well (prefer SE if anyone is looking to get rid of one). Also looking for OG dyesubs should someone be looking to get rid of theirs. 

If you have something else interesting feel free to offer away, the worst I can say is no :) Also, we can discuss adding paypal on either end of the trade if necessary. 

Feel free to ask any questions or request further images :)

Not FCFS. Will get shipped out as I am able, as mentioned above.

Just a small sale today for some extra prototype sets I've made recently. These are blank Topre Hi-Pro keysets for the Topre HHKB. Each set is cast using resin and hand finished. These sets do NOT have the 6 deep dish homing row keys of original Hi-Pro sets, but only deep dish homing keys on F and J. Many people in the community have found this setup to be more comfortable than the homing row. [All modifier caps are reinforced and thickened for extra durability.](https://imgur.com/jbGA6kJ) Sound test here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDh9l7XTMcg

It will come with the GMK Oblivion keycap set that is pictured on it - the Rama ""X"".  I have used this keyboard for about two weeks and I can't see any shine on the caps. It is the Navy / Dark grey configuration that was recently released by Cannon Keys and it's built on an FR4 6.25U plate.

She has been helping many stray cats/dogs (mainly cats) find homes, seek medical help (including surgeries) as well as helping to foster. I found her work really meaningful (especially because I like cats). Hence, I'll state 2 prices (just $10 difference), if you would like to help, you can opt to purchase the slightly more expensive price, it's perfectly okay if you don't want to. The donation will be publicly recorded at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asY5BAWSZ_pmxUy2jxmaSa1eHDddTiLQlEhGi1niuyw/edit#gid=1722981492), under tehbingg. I'll update here once donated. (I hope this is allowed by the mods, otherwise please let me know, I'll be willing to remove.)  Prior donations from previous sales have been made (can be seen in the spreadsheet).

All of these kits have **no shine,** and feels pretty new. I can provide more photos upon request:)

This would not be FCFS as I would like to prioritize the donation prices to help a little more.

Hello all, I have more things that I no longer plan to use. Sorry, but CONUS for now.

&#x200B;

Keyboard bundles:

~~Space65 R1 Bundle (Includes built keyboard, extra carbon fiber plate, MK Ultra foam, and GMK Voyage set (Base + Novelties + Mission Map deskmat))~~

~~I really love how this one looks, but sadly I haven’t used it as much anymore after I got my Vega. Selling to fund my other hobbies and collectibles. Keyboard is built with Holy Trash Panda switches (lubed with Krytox 205g0), Durock stabs, and aluminum plate. No external defects as far as I can see, but the bottom right rubber foot has a slight tear due to accessing the screws.~~

~~Extra keyboard pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/pNHFNmu](https://imgur.com/a/pNHFNmu)~~

~~Extra CF plate is from R2 and new. The MK Ultra case foam was used once. Plate foam was never used.~~

~~GMK Voyage set has been my daily driver for a couple months (no gaming). There isn’t any shine as far as I can see. Can't ship with the tray, since it won't fit in a flat rate box with the keyboard, but I can ship the outer cover upon request. Mission map deskmat was used for roughly the same amount of time. No staining or fraying. Wiped off any bit of dust and lint that I saw.~~

~~Looking for $850 shipped for bundle. Will split if someone wants to buy the board without the extras.~~SOLD board only

&#x200B;

~~Leopold FC660M bundle (Includes stock keyboard and MT3 Serika keycaps (Katakana + Mods + Numpad + Extra Mods + Novelties + 6U black spacebar + 2 1.25U Geometry caps (NOTE: SOME MOD KEYCAPS ARE MISSING))~~

~~Extra keyboard pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/XHyVCr4](https://imgur.com/a/XHyVCr4)~~

~~Thought this would be a keyboard that I would bring to the office, but that never really happened. Keyboard has Cherry MX clear switches, stock stabilizers, and no stock keycaps.~~

~~As for the keycaps, I basically bought two incomplete modifier sets and combined them together. There are definitely more than enough keys to fill a full-sized board, but it might be a dealbreaker to others. Because the FC660M spacebar is non-standardized, I added adhesive putty to the underside of the spacebar that adheres to two plastic stems I cut off from a cheap keycap. I can remove the putty or provide extra upon request.~~

~~Keycap list: (Red means missing, Green means there are 2 of the same cap)~~

~~[https://imgur.com/a/h4DF4Lg](https://imgur.com/a/h4DF4Lg)~~

~~Looking for $200 shipped for bundle. Will split if I get a buyer for the board only.~~ SOLD

What's up everyone!

I hope you're all doing great! I am changing up my interest and am thus letting go part of my Monochrome collection. Before we go further, a quick word:

&nbsp;

※ This will not be FCFS, I will go like this: Trades > Bundles > Sales.

※ All prices are *OBO* meaning that I may accept lower offers, feel free to negotiate. I don't want a bid war, if a key is marked as pending/sold/traded, no need to PM me to offer more.

※ Prices include PP fees but don't include shipping (PM me for confirmation);

※ **Should we trade, please keep the declared valued under $20, my country is a bitch in Custom fees (€30 flat + 21% of the total value (items + shipping))**.

&nbsp;

What's up everyone!

I hope you're all doing great! Shuffling a little bit my collection. Before we go further, a quick word:

&nbsp;

※ This will not be FCFS, I will go like this: Trades > Bundles > Sales.

※ All prices are *OBO* meaning that I may accept lower offers, feel free to negotiate. I don't want a bid war, if a key is marked as pending/sold/traded, no need to PM me to offer more.

※ Prices include PP fees but don't include shipping (PM me for confirmation);

※ **Should we trade, please keep the declared valued under $20, my country is a bitch in Custom fees (€30 flat + 21% of the total value (items + shipping))**.

Hi everyone,

Getting rid of some more stuff.

**Space65 R1 Keyboard** \- **$500 free shipping**   \- still available

**Keycaps not included**

Egg color (e-white top, e-yellow bottom, black badge)

PCB with MillMax 7305 sockets installed

Carbon Fiber plate

Aluminum plate

Bumpons (unused) will be included

Some issues to know about the Space65. The keyboard is definitely used but in good condition overall. I don't see any large scratches.

The CF plate I think is slightly too thick, so you can see the case doesn't quite close all the way (the board currently has the CF plate in it so you can see what it looks like in the picture). The aluminum plate does not have this problem.

The Esc key and the Right arrow key scrape against the corner of the case slightly when you press them. Would recommend against using any non-plastic keycaps in those spots.  I actually had 2 Space65 boards briefly, and they both had the same problem, though I haven't really heard of anyone else having that problem for some reason.

The aluminum plate is very tight when it comes to installing switches. I believe this is a common problem with many R1 aluminum plates. JWK switches (Alpacas etc) work OK, but Inks don't fit well.  The CF plate doesn't have any problems with Inks.

**GMK Rudy Base Set + Dark Horse Alphas - $450 free shipping** -- **sold for $400**

Opened/slightly used but in good condition. Used a few days at most.

**Navy Chimera 65% keyboard from CannonKeys**

The keyboard is used, but in pretty good shape overall. I don't see any major scratches, though it is definitely used so there will likely be some small scratches somewhere.  

&#x200B;

**Standard Kit:**

\- Navy board with silver back accent and top badge

\- PCB with MillMax 7305 sockets installed

\- Brass Plate

\- Carrying Case (TX-style bag, it came with the board)

**Extras**

\- Brass back accent and top badge

\- Extra unused/unopened PCB with daughterboard

\- FR4 plate

\- Carbon Fiber plate

~~i bought this in 2020 but have never used it at all. the shipping was slow enough so i managed to buy a drop planck and drop preonic meanwhile. it's black, it's the glow edition and it has cherry mx brown switches. it has the keyboard, the box, the usb-c cable, the usb-a usb-c adapter, the extra keys and the ""new smell"". it's in original condition, never done anything with the firmware and it still has more than 1 year of warranty.~~

Hi and thanks for viewing my sale post! Beautiful set here, but life, so sadly I’m parting ways. I’d be happy to get it into the hands of another git lover.

Details: this set is not BNIB, I just still have the box and sleeve. I am the original owner from the group buy. I can ship in the box or do bags for a little cheaper, we can talk. I have used them pretty regularly, so you can expect some shine on the alphas and main mod keys, but a lot of the other mods are unused. No chips or blems, really just need a good bath at most.

Hi everyone,

Getting rid of some more stuff.

**Space65 R1 Keyboard** \- **$500 free shipping**   \- still available

**Keycaps not included**

Egg color (e-white top, e-yellow bottom, black badge)

PCB with MillMax 7305 sockets installed

Carbon Fiber plate

Aluminum plate

Bumpons (unused) will be included

Some issues to know about the Space65. The keyboard is definitely used but in good condition overall. I don't see any large scratches.

The CF plate I think is slightly too thick, so you can see the case doesn't quite close all the way (the board currently has the CF plate in it so you can see what it looks like in the picture). The aluminum plate does not have this problem.

The Esc key and the Right arrow key scrape against the corner of the case slightly when you press them. Would recommend against using any non-plastic keycaps in those spots.  I actually had 2 Space65 boards briefly, and they both had the same problem, though I haven't really heard of anyone else having that problem for some reason.

The aluminum plate is very tight when it comes to installing switches. I believe this is a common problem with many R1 aluminum plates. JWK switches (Alpacas etc) work OK, but Inks don't fit well.  The CF plate doesn't have any problems with Inks.

Hello MM bruhs and bruhettes, I have some goodies up for sale today. I tried to price everything pretty fair for a quick sale as I'm kind of in an emergency situation and in need of funds. If something is crazy just please let me know, can work on a deal or if you want to bundle something. Thanks for looking :)

&#x200B;

**GMK Nautilus Nightmares** \- Complete base kit with box trays. Box it a little beat up but keys are great, no shine as seen in the pics. **$200**

**ePBT Valentine** \- Complete kit, comes in a bag. Very nice keycaps for the price. **$75**

**67x Kailh Pro Purple** \- Lightly tactile switches with the bump at the VERY top, kind of unique in that way. A decent switch. **$20**

**~~Tofu60 Aluminum Black~~** ~~- dz60rgb\_ansi v1 hotswap, durock purple screw-in stabs lubed, has case foam. Has a small nick on the front left corner (see pic). Everything you need beside switches and keycaps, luckily I have those available below :)~~ **~~$160~~** Sold!

**~~NK65 Entry Edition Frost~~** ~~- I wasn't gonna put this up for sale but just incase anyone is interested. It does have a small crack in the PC housing at the top left corner. It's there but in normal use hardly noticeable. If you're interested I can show a pic of the crack up close.~~ **~~$125~~** Sold!

**~~Tofu60 Clear Acrylic~~** ~~- Gasket modded feels and sounds great, screw-in stabs, Holy Polar Pandas lubed with Tribosys 3203, underglow RGB, case and pcb foam. This is a great entry to getting yourself that amazing gasket feel and sound at a budget price.~~ [~~Video~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2BQEavCfrg) ~~of how this was done (not mine).~~ **~~$180~~** Sold!

**~~GMK Mitolet~~** ~~- Complete base kit with old school plastic trays. Keys are great, again no shine.~~ **~~$150~~** Sold!

**~~74x U4 Boba~~** ~~- Lubed and filmed, a great silent tactile, if not the best. Almost completely silent if you properly mod and lube your stabs.~~ **~~$80~~** Sold!

**~~71x c3 equalz Kiwi~~** ~~- As far as I know these have never come back into stock, another great tactile switch with a unique colorway. These are stock with the original ""factory lube"".~~ **~~$80~~** Sold!

Hey there everyone, hope you're doing well

Today I have a few boards I'd like to put up for trade/sale considering they don't see too much use and would be better suited to someone else.

**PLEASE READ** -  I will be unable to ship ANY ITEMS until January 12th at the absolute earliest. Please keep this in mind when inquiring about trades or otherwise. 


Item | Description| Want
---|---|----
FMJ80| Black WKL. Currently built with Gerry's (cherry housing + gat yellow stem + 68g SPRiT slows lubed with 3204 and 105 on springs) on an alum half plate. The case is in good condition with a very slight ding on the right side above the left arrow key. Comes with USB converter. Can desolder if preferred. Keycaps not included. | $1250 OBO, Trades
Kokua| Grey. Currently unbuilt. Kit includes 3 PCBs ( a twice desoldered ProjectKB pcb that is fully functional (USB Mini), hotswap USB-C Sneakbox PCB, and a brand new Mechlovin PCB (USB-mini)). Also comes with three plates: brass, red aluminum, and 3/4 Hiney FR4. Please see the following images for slight issues with the finish https://i.imgur.com/f9GGzjJ.jpg https://i.imgur.com/jojLOYv.jpg. | Sold for $750 (1 PCB + 1 Plate)
KMAC v1| Silver. Currently built with lubed (3204) retooled blacks and 65g TX springs on a full aluminum plate. Keycaps not included. Still not 100% whether or not I'll let this go. | ~~$650 OBO, trades~~ Sold for asking
[ALF DC60](https://imgur.com/a/9OhYubE)| E White. Currently built with Alpacas (lubed with 3204) on an alum full plate and lubed Zeal stabs. The case is in very good condition with a very slight ding on the left side near the shift/caps lock key. Including PBT muted (purchased from flashquark) as pictured in the build, but will include the remainder of the kit too. Will include a steel full plate and a PCB that currently will not connect due to a loose USB-C connector (I believe it just needs solder added to the joint, but I'm no expert). Also due to 3m tape wrapped around the plate/pcb the left control has very slight stick if pressed down aggressively, but you can always remove the tape. Ships in original box.| ~~$200 shipped OBO~~ Sold for $170
[Lubrigante](https://imgur.com/a/sVIbnYm)| Built with 205g0 lubed NK blueberries on a wonderland PCB. Some flaws: To disclose some of the flaws: I lost two of the original stand-offs for the screws. I found ones that fit into the cutouts for the standoffs, but they're slightly longer than the ones provided with the kit originally. They fit more snug, so it's not that much of an issue. [These photos](https://imgur.com/a/5nv6yxi) from the original owner also show that he had to install wires to bridge some switches. The switches that are affected are H and right B, as he accidentally ripped a trace during a desoldering. With the wires, the keys work just fine. No sticker(s) are on the bottom now| ~~$180 shipped OBO~~ Sold for asking
| GMK 8008 | Used base kit and obscure kit (used lightly for approximately 1 month) | ~~$280 shipped~~ Sold for $250

For trades I'm primarily interested in some TKLs and a select few 60% boards. KFE (yes, I know, but I really like silver), FLX Virgo, or a 456GT or Koala (lol). I could be persuaded to trade something for a Kei as well (prefer SE if anyone is looking to get rid of one). Also looking for OG dyesubs should someone be looking to get rid of theirs. 

If you have something else interesting feel free to offer away, the worst I can say is no :) Also, we can discuss adding paypal on either end of the trade if necessary. 

Feel free to ask any questions or request further images :)

Not FCFS. Will get shipped out as I am able, as mentioned above.

I know there are a lot of people already offering free build services but I wanted to offer my service as well for variety sake!

I have been in this hobby for about 2 years now and I love it! For me, building keyboards is the most fun part! I have all the tools to build your keyboard so you don't have to.

I would like to build your keyboard for free! I will be streaming it on Twitch but you can elect for me not to as well. I am not new to streaming but new to streaming keyboard builds.

I only ask that you pay for shipping both ways and I will take care of the rest. Please give me a shot, I promise your won't regret it!

I am located in Denver, CO. I'm open to local drop off and picks as well.

Shipping (**US only**): USPS tracked and **insured** flat rate $10 for Keycaps, $5 for deskmat and $20 for Keyboards. Post office near me has very limited COVID hours right now so shipping might not be as snappy as usual but will make as fast as possible.

Keycaps are **untouched** and **sealed** (except for SA Laser which is untouched and unused but in baggies).

**NOT SPLITTING UP SETS** so pm'ing to ask is not going to do anything, sorry but it seems to be near impossible to make this clear. Offers are welcome but not planning to stray too far and not in a rush or anything. Thanks for understanding :).

Please comment before PM'ing and feel free to ask any questions aside from the above very clear rules and sorry only selling not trading.

Apologies if responses are bit slow I am working at the moment but I will get back to you!

A few notes on boards:

**E8.5:** completely unused, received finally recently only removed from original packaging to take pictures. Just didn't end up being my form factor after ordering a long time ago. Package details:

* Layout: WKL
* PCB (2): Solder and Hotswap
* Top Color: E Black
* Bottom Color: E Black
* Plate Color (2): Titanium and E Yellow
* Accent Colors(2): PVD Silver and E Yellow
* Side Weight Colors(2): E Black and E Yellow
* Middle Gasket Mount: Yes
* Inner Middle: E Black

&#x200B;

**Think 6.5 R1:** Polycarb no front badge, comes with extra hotswap pcb and alternate black rear badge. Built but never used, couple of things to note. 4 screws are missing from bottom, the middle 4 as they never came with the order, these can easily be replaced I just have not done so as they don't really effect anything. No issues or blemishes with board and comes soldered with Gateron Inks switch filmed and lubed with 205g0.

**CA66**: this one is really killing me to give up, built and used but only slightly as it never made the daily rotation. Dark grey with gold badge HHKB style with bluetooth including installed almost unused 3.7V 3000mAh 595085 Li-ion Rechargeable Lithium Polymer Li-Po Battery as well as installed Brass plate. Switches are harvested Vintage Blacks, switch filmed and lubed with 205g0. There are a few cosmetic defects only noticeable one is on the back as seen in pictures, as well as a slight one on the front forward face.

Looking for people with some decent trade history, if not here, then elsewhere on Reddit. If you're local we can discuss more. Also interested in trades for balisongs such as a live blade Krake Raken. Also CNC tooling, especially TTS tooling, carbide endmills, and maybe metrology stuff. I didn't put those in the title for obvious reasons.

Sorry I won't be answering pms tonight, got stuff to do.

~~######GMK MIZU BASE KIT - $360 or best offer~~

~~Light use, no shine, according to its previous owner and my own eyes. Bought it off of mechmarket last summer and never got around to using it because it didn't have perfect compatibility for the strange board I was using at the time :T. Only selling with the tray, I don't have the box, I just have it in a tray from some other GMK set that I sold in bags.~~

~~######GMK DOTS BASE KIT - $330 or best offer~~

~~This I did use for several months. The heaviest shine is found on the ""•"" key, the ""•"" key, the ""•"" key, and on the 2.5u and 2.25u split spacebars. The ""•"" also has some light shine... What do you want from me here? It's the usual suspects, the row 1 ""E"" key and such, but you can switch any key from the same row around, including the numpad, so shine isn't all that important in my opinion here *unless you are one of the special people using split spacebars*. Sold in its tray with box.~~

~~Bought it on here, I didn't use it, again with my freakish layouts. There's some very faint shine on the 6.25u spacebar, can't see any on the rest. I don't know if this is the first Hyperfuse or Hyperfuse Origins (which is supposedly in stock on Originative), or if there's any difference between the two.

Spring Cleaning 🧹 Keyboard edition

Hi all, looking to downsize a bit and find a trade/purchase for a Blue-grey WKL XRF (Silver’s good too)

I will hold off on my replies to purchase requests for a few hours (but please feel free to ask questions) to see if I can any trade offers for a XRF.

**CONUS ONLY** (sorry)

~~**TypeMachina x TGR Jane 1.5**
Perfect condition, slight ano mismatch as shown in the gallery. Weight is ever so slightly starting to patina. Comes with black aluminum plate, a brand new TGR Pontoporia v1.1 PCB, and a cleanly desoldered Hiney h87a 1.7.
**$1900 shipped in TX case**~~ **Traded**

~~**Iron165**~~ **SOLD** ~~(Copper/Black badges still available)~~ **SOLD**
~~Navy A-stock (or was 😅), somehow accidentally nicked the front ledge. Very small scuff, but it’s there. Comes with Tsangan brass plate, unfinished tsangan aluminum plate from SendCutSend, 2x PCBs, and extra badges (black/copper).~~
~~**$1900 shipped in Iron165 case**~~ Sold for $1720 without extra badges 

~~**Rukia R1**~~ **SOLD**
~~Case is in pristine condition, PVD brass weight has those micro hairline scratches that are inevitable with PVD surfaces. Comes with a brass plate, PC plate, FR4 plate, and a cleanly desoldered ProjectKB PCB.~~
~~**$800 shipped in foam box**~~

~~**Kei**~~ **SOLD**
~~Blue HHKB Kei, brand new unbuilt in perfect condition. Comes with aluminum plate, PC half plate, sealed PCB, oring, and the replacement screws that were sent out last month.~~ 
~~**$750 shipped in Monokei box**~~

~~**Ori CLS-1 (Ori87)**~~ **SOLD**
~~Silver WKL with stainless steel and red accents. Comes with red aluminum plate, 1x brand new PCB and 1x cleanly desolder PCB. This board as you may or may not know, didn’t have the best manufacturer. There are 2 small dents that were present prior to anodizing, one on the bottom and one on the back as shown in the gallery. One of the case screws (shown) does not sit completely flush like the rest. One of the side accent screw is a tad too short for the thread, along with 4x daughterboard screws that will need to replaced with slightly longer screws to lock in properly. 
Due to the fact that I only noticed the screw issues recently, I will need to source proper screws before shipping it out, but should be able to do so before the end of the week. You can also choose to source your own screws at a discount 😅.~~
~~**$1200 or $1150 BYOS (bring your own screws) shipped in Ori Carry case**~~

~~**Fjell R4**~~ **SOLD**
~~R4 in grey, scuffed front edge as shown in the gallery. Brass has developed a mean tarnish. Comes with a PVD brass plate and a hotswap DZ60RGB PCB.~~
**$350 shipped in Mekanisk box**

**My priority is a blue-grey/silver WKL XRF, so I will give it a few hours before I reply to purchase PMs. Priority will then be given to the order in which the PMs are received**

Hello all, have some things for sale today. All prices include insured CONUS shipping with USPS Priority. If you'd like UPS or Fedex, we can work that out in pms, but I would prefer USPS.

|Name|Price|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
|KFE CE|SOLD for $680|Unused, opened to check contents. I swapped to the poly plate, but otherwise it hasn't been touched. Comes with all original packaging and accessories (2x plates, PCB, both sets of weights, screws, tools, etc). I bought this for a friend, but they ended up getting one as well during the in-stock sale. This is priced so that I break even after PP and shipping, and I can show the original invoice if you'd like to check my math. This board is currently in pre-order on [monokei.co](https://monokei.co) for a little bit less.|
|GMK Taro R2|~~$230~~ SOLD|Sealed. See pics in timestamp album.|
|77x Alpaca V2|~~$45~~ SOLD|Unused.|

Preference will go to bundles and buyers that I've transacted with in the past, and then local (NJ, 08824). Happy to provide any additional pics or info.
