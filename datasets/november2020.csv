Looking to sell a planned build to buy a new laptop and drawing tablet for my sister. I want to sell as a bundle because the Mizu base kit is sealed, and the OG GMK tray size is terrible for shipping. Luckily I still have the box the Space65 was sent to me in, which fits the kit perfectly. **As a result, here are the bundle combinations I will offer:**

**ALL SOLD, THANK YOU!**

1. **~~Space65~~**
2. **~~Space65+GMK Mizu~~**
3. **~~Space65+Mauves~~**
4. **~~Space65+GMK Mizu+Mauves~~**

**Space65**

Still sealed brand new Black/Gold kit with a carbon fiber plate. All parts should still be in the box, including the vibration and noise reduction pads, screwdriver, tweezers, weight, etc. Looking for $640 shipped by itself, and $620 as part of a bundle.

**GMK Mizu**

Still sealed brand new GMK Mizu base kit from way back when. The base kit should cover most standard things such as 60%, MX HHKB, WKL, 75%, TKL, 1800, and full size. Looking for $380 shipped as part of a bundle.

**~~Mauves~~** **Sold**

69 Mauves. 65g spring with a POM Stem, nylon housing, and nylon/PC blend top. Looking for $30 shipped as part of a bundle.

Depending on the circumstances, I might decide to sell GMK Mizu separately or change the bundle options. However, my first priority is to sell the Space65 so I won't really open up that option until the board has been sold.

Hello all,

Up for sale I have a **brand new and sealed Infinikey PBT Islander Core +  Expansion + Novelties**. I am not interested in splitting them up and I am  seeking **$330 + shipping CONUS.** Local cash and trades are preferred but PayPal is fine as well.

Also available is a **Mechcables Laser Midnight 5ft, 7"" Jumbo Coil ( USB 2.0 - USB C** ). I am seeking **40$ + shipping CONUS.** 

\-------------------------------------------------

As for trades, I am looking for any 65% or 75% boards in any color, any Alice clones, Purple N65 Entry Edition, Laser Dawn ALT 65%, TKC Lefty Candybar (of any color), GMK Laser (any sets, Gaijin & Mitowaves preferred), RAMA Inventory (any color), GMK Bento (any sets, Gaijin preferred), or SA Vilebloom.  If you feel any of these trades are worth more, I am willing to negotiate to add cash for the trade as well. That being said, I would  add a good amount of cash to a trade for a RAMA WORKS U80-A in any color, preferably Port.

Whatever your offer is, don't be afraid to hit me up. I'm always down to hear your offer and maybe we can figure something out. I will accept local cash, trades, and PayPal.

It's a black aluminum Tofu 60, silver backplate, the PCB is the hotswap DZ60RGB-ANSI, this is the v1 which does NOT have electrostatic discharge protection. If you have the LEDs on and shock the case, the lights turn off until you unplug/plug-in. Also I believe I flashed a VIA compatible firmware. There is some damping foam under the board, stabs are clipped, lubed and bandaid modded. Comes with a cable as well.

I did take the liberty of installing 7305s as I was going to use it. I installed 7305s everywhere except for the 1x on the backspace since it sits on the same level as the stabilizers and doesn't work. If you want, I can install them for you.

Please ""comment"" then ""PM"", don't use ""chat""

""All shipping is at buyers risk. no refund or exchange"" P.S. I have recently met a very non-sense and demanding buyer making trouble, so I have to put this here to protect myself. Normally this never is an issue.

As the title says, I have a Silver KBD75v2 w/ lubed 62g Zealios v2 switches and GMK Screw-in stabilizers that I'm looking to sell. This was my first ever build (built earlier this year). I used the board for about a month or so before letting the MK hobby take over, resulting in me building a Space65 board soon after (which has since been my daily driver). The board does not have any scratches or scuffs. I will be willing to sell the GMK Redsuns as well, if you need keycaps.

I will only accept Paypal and the price indicated includes PayPal fee, but DOES NOT include shipping. Only shipping CONUS!",[US-WA] [H] Silver KBD75v2 w/ lubed 62g Zealios v2 switches & GMK screw in stabs on Brass Plate [W] Paypal

|~~GK21s (Grey)~~|~~Used for roughly 6 months. I didn't use much of the Bluetooth function but saw reviews saying battery is very bad. Also I noticed it was quite easy to pull the switch out when I just wanted to pull the keycaps (EPBT). Didn't find other issues within the 6 months and it worked pretty well for me. Didn't do any mods to this numpad. Has everything that came with the package.~~|~~$70+shipping~~Sold for asking|

Hello r/mm

I am posting a sale for the Xeno that I just built the other night on stream. Due to some financial adjustments I am selling all of this ASAP which I know is off putting to some but I just don't have the money to hold onto this for very long which was a mistake on my part. This will NOT be FCFS!

I will also be excepting trades but strictly only for what I list below and I cannot add paypal on my end and most likely will request Paypal from you.

**Black Built Xeno -** $880 Shipped OBO

The board is built with YOK Mint Holy Pandas lubed with Tribosys 3204 on a Full Brass plate. The board is completely functional but there is a bridge connection from backspace onto the pipe key. Additionally there are two knicks on the anno that I show in the time stamp. Otherwise the board feels and sounds fantastic. Will come in original box.

**GMK Finer Things Base Kit - $300 OBO** **SOLD**

Full base kit used for about a day as of this post. No shine whatsoever. Will ship in bags

**Fraktal Kaps Spice is Life Ankurah - $70 OBO**

This is the Fraktal Kap Ankurah artisan keycap in the Spice is Life Colorway.

[Timestamp - Metaverse R2 Base Kit](https://imgur.com/a/kX1QW8E)

Hi mechmarket, this is my first time posting, please go easy on me.

I know many will be upset with me selling this Vega. Thing is, I have been looking forward to the Vega for months now and I was extremely excited to have been able to order one from the in-stock release. However, after days of deliberation, I decided I wanted a different color since I have too many things black on my desk.

I still love the Vega so I went ahead and joined the groupbuy for a color I want. Since I don't mind the wait, I am letting this black one go for anyone who doesn't want to wait for the groupbuy to ship.

As for the GMK Metaverse set, I love this set but I love Olivia more. I purchased this GMK Metaverse set from DailyClack when they surprised dropped a restock on preorder extras so, knowing my luck with the Olivia extras, I went for it. I was never expecting NK to restock Olivia for Black Friday but somehow I managed to place an order for a kit (I was jaw-dropped. You won't believe how excited I was!).

I understand many will be upset with me selling these items at an inflated price. Please understand it was never my intention to flip these. If I could go back in time, I would not be here right now. 

Maybe think of the inflated price as a premium for getting the Vega early! Or maybe as a way to help me out in this crazy hobby. The extra bit of cash will help me out immensely.

Thank you so much for your interest and reading (maybe not? haha) my long stupid story.

I am unfortunately only shipping within the US right now. Sorry to all the folks out there.

\* Buying zilent v2 in smaller quantities is a tad bit more expensive per switch due to the same shipping price, packaging as 70 or 110 switches. You can 20 switches too, but it will be even more expensive 38 eu for 20 switches (of course shipping and pp fees included).

&#x200B;

PLEASE READ. FAQ:

* Should I leave comment before pming?
   * YES. Please COMMENT before PMing me, without comment chats will be ignored.
* You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually  include shipping and pp fees.
* How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster.
* Are prices correct?
   * All prices are correct.
* How are you selling?

Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.

Hello! Hope you all are doing well.

Today I have a couple of items that I do not use for sale/trade.

Prices include PayPal fees, but not shipping.  EU preferred, but I can ship internationally.

Bare in mind that I paid 23% import tax on ePBT Kuro/Shiro together with costly DHL shipping to my country that is why the price is higher that during the GB.

UPD: Sorry, I decided to hold Kuro/Shiro for now, found a keyboard on which I can put them.

|*Item*|*Asking Price*|*Description*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**~~ePBT Kuro/Shiro R2 Alphas/JP Mods~~**|~~180 EUR~~ **ON HOLD**|Never mounted. Moved JP mods from bag into hard plastic tray.|
|~~GMK N9 Ortho Add-on kit~~|~~45 EUR~~ **SOLD**|Sealed, never used. **NOTE:** You can buy this kit on [keeb.io](https://keeb.io) for 50$ that is why this sale is mostly for EU people.|
|~~BadHabitCaps Pumpkin Tiki-Key~~|~~15 USD~~ **SOLD**|I won this artisan during the Halloween giveaway, so asking price is what I paid for shipping (shipping to you is not included).|

Thanks for looking! Please commend ""PM"" before under this post and use DM and not chat.

Have a nice day!","[EU-EE][H] ePBT Kuro/Shiro Alphas/JP mods, GMK N9 Ortho Add-on Kit, Artisan[W] Paypal"

**Shipping is not included**. Will give priority to EU buyers but open to others if you're willing to pay for the (probably) high shipping costs.

Shipping to EU will vary but should be between 10-30 euros depending on item and location.

Hi everyone, looking to clear some stuff out that I am not using.

All prices exclude shipping, and I am only shipping to the UK/EU at the moment, sorry :(

Need everything gone ASAP, so send me an offer if you're interested. 

&#x200B;

| Romeo | Bought this to practice soldering. Built plateless with NK creams (lubed with 205G0), and Durock V1 screw in stabs (lubed with Superlube). Comes with a slightly scuffed bottom plate. Also selling a P3D Romeo Case with this (see pictures). Does NOT come with an acrylic piece to cover the top components, but this does not affect usage, it's just an aesthetic thing. |*PRICE DROP* £50 for the PCB, switches. stabs, and bottom plate. £40 for the case. £85 for both. Very interested in selling the P3D case, so please PM me your offers (although prices are significantly lower than retail already) |
|:-|:-|:-|
| SA Pulse Round 3 |Comes with the standard alphas and noire icon mods. Previous seller (from [r/mm](https://www.reddit.com/r/mm/)) says he/she barely used it, and I have never taken it out of the bag. Selling because I am not a fan of SA anymore. |£110 (cheaper than GB price, after customs and shipping) |
| Niu Mini | I bought this off another [r/mm](https://www.reddit.com/r/mm/) user who used it for a month. Built with the aluminium, rather than acrylic, bottom piece. Lubed Gateron Black Inks are soldered onto the board in a grid layout, as shown in the timestamp. No visible external flaws (have not opened it up to check the PCB, but it has been tested and it works perfectly). Selling because ortho is not for me, I have only typed on it for about 15 min. |*PRICE DROP* £110, significantly cheaper than buying all of the parts and building yourself (just the case and PCB would cost about £120 after customs and shipping)|
| Cafe Dark Alphas (Black Kit) |Opened but unused (apart from the 7u spacebar, which was used for 2 weeks). Shipped in original GMK packaging. |£100. Kinda accepted I'm gonna lose money on this haha|
|Tofu 60% Acrylic (case only)|Bought for a planned build, but managed to get my hands on a D65 so I longer need this. Opened but unused, will be shipped in original box. Couple of very small blemishes next to the standoffs (see [here](https://imgur.com/UsWF0mr)), but as I said, this is brand new so it must have just been produced like that.|£85 (again, a new one directly from kbdfans will run you close to £110 after customs and shipping)|","[EU-UK] [H] Cafe Dark Alphas, Romeo with P3D Case, Niu Mini, SA Pulse R3, New Tofu Acrylic [W] Paypal"

~~I usually just collect keyboards, and I have a separate keyboard for daily use, so these are in good condition. The stabs are also pretty good.~~

~~One thing to note is that the keycaps are only optionally included with the keyboard since selling the keycaps separately would take too much shipping cost. If you are willing to pay for shipping just for the keycaps, feel free to ask.~~

Hi MM -

Raising funds for house things^(likewashingmachinesanddoors)

**First:** [Timestamp](https://i.imgur.com/mhERoNU.jpeg)

**TX65:**

\- TX65 Grey, ISO  
\- Switches are Panda base, BSUN top, Zealio stem, SPRiT springs (68g), 72g on space and enter.  
\- Switches and stabilisers are lubed.  
\- GMK screw-in stabilisers with SPRiT gold-plated wires.  
\- Small strip of foam under the spacebar for mild dampening  
\- Orginal TX bag, TX microfibre, TX caps, spare screws  
\- Matching 3m USB to Mini-USB, and extra microfibre (good for covering when not in use).

**Condition:**

Generally excellent. Case has no visible flaws. The brass weight has one minor blemish that can only be seen in certain light, I've tried my best to capture this on the photos. Mileage is low, I've used it mostly for glamour shots but the switches are nicely bedded in and smooth.

Haven't managed to get the use out of these I hoped. As new, no shine.

 DSA Overcast: White alphas, Blue mods, Blue 1337 kit, Orange mods, Symm kit, Blanks.

 DSA miami dolch base, 60%, TKL, numpad, WHITEFOX, 65%, 75% MODIFIERS, vice accent, macro.

**Prices:**

TX65 - Drop to £575, which is less paid for the parts alone.

DSA Overcast - £90

DSA Miami Dolch - £130

Looking to sell a planned build to buy a new laptop and drawing tablet for my sister. I want to sell as a bundle because the Mizu base kit is sealed, and the OG GMK tray size is terrible for shipping. Luckily I still have the box the Space65 was sent to me in, which fits the kit perfectly. **As a result, here are the bundle combinations I will offer:**

**ALL SOLD, THANK YOU!**

1. **~~Space65~~**
2. **~~Space65+GMK Mizu~~**
3. **~~Space65+Mauves~~**
4. **~~Space65+GMK Mizu+Mauves~~**

**Space65**

Still sealed brand new Black/Gold kit with a carbon fiber plate. All parts should still be in the box, including the vibration and noise reduction pads, screwdriver, tweezers, weight, etc. Looking for $675 shipped by itself, and $660 as part of a bundle.

**GMK Mizu**

Still sealed brand new GMK Mizu base kit from way back when. The base kit should cover most standard things such as 60%, MX HHKB, WKL, 75%, TKL, 1800, and full size. Looking for $360 shipped as part of a bundle.

**Mauves**

69 Mauves. 65g spring with a POM Stem, nylon housing, and nylon/PC blend top. Looking for $33 shipped as part of a bundle.

Depending on the circumstances, I might decide to sell GMK Mizu separately or change the bundle options. However, my first priority is to sell the Space65 so I won't really open up that option until the board has been sold.

I REALLY wanted to love this board (which is why I bought the extras for long term ownership), but after trying to learn to use it on two separate occasions I have reached the conclusion that the split ergo layout really isn't for me. 

The Maja is in EXCELLENT condition with no visible scratches, dents, etc. It comes built with lubed durock stabilizers. Additionally, the board didn't ship with enough screws (there are enough to assemble w/ no flex or issues, just a few that need screws on the pcb --> plate side) so I am including a spare set that I purchased after the fact from KBDfans. I never opened it up to install the extra screws, but can if the buyer would like.

~~**KBDFANS X VULCAN MAJA (BLACK) HOTSWAP BUNDLE - $680 + SHIPPING, CONUS ONLY**~~ SOLD FOR $680 SHIPPED

-1x Spare brass Maja Plate

-1x Spare Maja hotswap PCB

-1x Spare Maja plate foam 

-1x Maja wooden wrist wrest from KBDfans

-all leftover screws + additional set of screws + screwdriver provided by KBDfans

~~**GMK Crimson Cadet (Base): - $220 shipped CONUS**~~ SOLD FOR ASK ($220)

only the alphas and arrow keys were used from this set. They were mounted to the maja and have less than 2 hours of typing on them. 

~~**PBT BRED - $180 shipped CONUS**~~ SOLD FOR ASK ($180)

only the numbers and modifiers were used from this set. Mounted to the maja in conjunction with the crimson cadet alphas. 2 hours or less of typing on them.

**PBT Sanctuary Rebirth - $180 shipped CONUS**

this set is brand new. they don't come wrapped so I unboxed it for photo purposes. As evident in both my PBT sets, the keys tend to fly around during shipping. Includes the additional spacebars (not pictured, I was moving the box it came in and saw them at the bottom.)

**ALL ITEMS CONUS ONLY. Bundle purchases will yield discounted prices.**

And some additional [Take me home](https://imgur.com/a/Nu9VOzl) photos and videos .

This is a personal Engraved E-White Bahm Evelyn (Korean Alice Clone) . It is built with Hirose Orange switches that are filmed with Orange TX films , all lubed with Krytox 205G0 . I sourced them myself from Japan and they feel incredible to type on . The stabilizers are band-aid modified and lubed & I used a combo of red and black to match the style and the appearance of a Hirose switch . The wire is gold plated to match the brass reinforcement plate . LED's are sky-blue ,Pcb is Adelais Undergrow RGB programable by VIA or QMK .

Evelyn comes with an original brass plate used for the prototype (there are scratches on it ) , aluminum plate comes with a unique color combination and an extra fr4 matte black plate and an extra Adelais Arc-En-Ciel Pcb.

Evelyn has heat treatment black lines on the polished brass weight but no noticeable scratches on it. There are scratches on the inside of the top and bottom housing where the screws go in , otherwise on the exterior there are no visible scratches.

|[GMK Striker Core](https://imgur.com/a/m1hLWdT)|I bought this set for aftermarket a few days before the R2 announcement and am just trying to get back what I paid. It's a beautiful set but I currently don't have any boards to mount these puppies on unfortunately and can't justify keeping these when I have bills to pay. I haven't used the keycaps at all and they are like new with no shine anywhere. I don't have the original tray but they will be shipped in the 9009 tray as I feel these are too expensive to ship in bags.|$450/$525 with spacebars|
|[GMK Striker Spacebars](https://imgur.com/a/m1hLWdT)|Like new, no shine. $525 bundled with the Striker base.|$100|
|[77x Lubed and Filmed NK Dry Yellows](https://imgur.com/NtJeAqk)|Housing and stems were lubed with 205g0, springs with GPL 105, and filmed with black Deskeys. 63.5g springs. Switches were never soldered. Ultra smooth like other JWK/Durock linears.|$65|
|[80x Unholy Pandas](https://imgur.com/NtJeAqk)|Never used. Made with Halo Clear housings/springs and YOK Polar Panda stems. Will also include the stock 60g Panda springs.|$30|

Letting go of some stuff to pay for a group buy trying to run, hope it goes to good use!

MT3 Serika Katakana and Modifiers Kit:

This was purchased from another user on mechmarket, and it turns out that MT3 is not for me. It looks to be in near mint condition, with only a spec on the left shift key.  Looking to get what I payed, $250 plus shipping in bags.

Also, if anyone has a set of GMK Dots they'd be interested in trading, please let me know! I also have GMK Cafe coming in pretty soon, it's currently in shipment. Either reach out to me through reddit pms/chats, although ill be able to get back to you much faster if you hit me up on discord at Beans#4848

Looking to sell a planned build to buy a new laptop and drawing tablet for my sister. I want to sell as a bundle because the Mizu base kit is sealed, and the OG GMK tray size is terrible for shipping. Luckily I still have the box the Space65 was sent to me in, which fits the kit perfectly. **As a result, here are the bundle combinations I will offer:**

**ALL SOLD, THANK YOU!**

1. **~~Space65~~**
2. **~~Space65+GMK Mizu~~**
3. **~~Space65+Mauves~~**
4. **~~Space65+GMK Mizu+Mauves~~**

**Space65**

Still sealed brand new Black/Gold kit with a carbon fiber plate. All parts should still be in the box, including the vibration and noise reduction pads, screwdriver, tweezers, weight, etc. Looking for $675 shipped by itself, and $660 as part of a bundle.

**GMK Mizu**

Still sealed brand new GMK Mizu base kit from way back when. The base kit should cover most standard things such as 60%, MX HHKB, WKL, 75%, TKL, 1800, and full size. Looking for $360 shipped as part of a bundle.

**Mauves**

69 Mauves. 65g spring with a POM Stem, nylon housing, and nylon/PC blend top. Looking for $33 shipped as part of a bundle.

Depending on the circumstances, I might decide to sell GMK Mizu separately or change the bundle options. However, my first priority is to sell the Space65 so I won't really open up that option until the board has been sold.

Need to get rid of some of my collection.

To my knowledge, the PC Kira60v2 was from a private group-buy in Singapore and features a top-mount design.

This board has marks on the bottom of the case from exposure to a solvent (at least, that's what the previous owner told me). The brass plate has been tarnished--I've tried cleaning this with 70% ethanol and had some progress but was too lazy to continue. Please see the timestamp photos. These aren't visible once built and on your desk.

Will come with a brass plate, a kbd6x hotswap + underglow pcb and GMK screw-in stabs. Does not come with keycaps or switches, the picture is there for reference.

Hey guys, I have some items to sell

All prices include PayPal fees, invoice only. As usual please comment before DM, no chat.

**Worldwide shipping,** will be calculated on request, please DM for that. For artisans should be about $10, for Ursa around $20. There is also an express shipping available, should be about $30-40.

Please note that mail services are still somewhat unpredictable, so shipping might take a long time.

&#x200B;

**1.** **GMK Ursa base sealed**

**Note**: trays were squished and cracked during shipping (yay new GMK).

In this situation I can: 1. Ship as is 2. Unseal and transfer in another good tray 3. Unseal and ship in bags

* Profile: SA
* Profile Row: Row 1
* Switch Type: MX (Cherry MX & Its clones)

Never used as a key, only put on for photos. Note that they both came in one box, so the first buyer gets the box, the second keycap will be shipped in some other form of secure package.

**$75 each or $135 for both** \+ shipping

&#x200B;

**3. Salvun comissioned artisan A-Stock**

I had some artisans that I commissioned Salvun with. I wanted them for myself but there are MOQs and all that jazz, so selling extras. In total 21 were made, 11 are b-stock (old CNC) and 10 are a-stock (new Haas CNC). There is 1 of a-stock remaining. MX stem, R1 (Esc row), Alu with anodizing and laser engraving, the design is an occult symbol of the MX stem.

##GMK Mizu, Dots, Oblivion, Hyperfuse, Eclipse - TRADE for - EXT65, Southpaw Extended

Dots and Eclipse have boxes. Only the pictured keycaps are for trade, not the boards they're on. 

Dots has light shine, I rotated out keys from the same rows to mitigate it. The others have no shine, I rotated out the entire keysets to mitigate it, lol.

Trading for the EXT65 (Al, not acrylic) or Southpaw Extended (either Al or bent steel).

edit: I'll also just straight up buy em for cash.

#EDIT 2 - thread closed

Well that was fast. Did some research and it didn't look like this was going to happen any time soon. I've bought an EXT 65 plate and PCB and I'll CNC an aluminum case my damn self.","[US-NJ][H] GMK sets for trade (Mizu, Dots, Oblivion, Hyperfuse, Eclipse) [W] EXT65, Southpaw Extended"

Hi mechmarket, I'm parting with two olive-green-coloured keysets that have been sitting around sad and neglected:

|~~GMK Olive (Base kit, 40s kit, spacebars kit). Very lightly used, no shine.~~|~~$375 shipped wherever (in bags!)~~ SOLD|
|:-|:-|
|Katakana Cherry PBT, Matcha. Barely used.|$110 shipped wherever|

The GMK set will be sent in bags rather than in the tray depicted. Since the GMK trays changed, I don't have any boxes on hand that are appropriate for a tray of this size. If you feel strongly about having the tray, I can try and look for a larger box, but it'll cost more and take longer to ship out.

Prices are in USD, and include shipping and Paypal fees. I prefer Canadian buyers for shipping simplicity (and not paying Paypal currency conversion fees), but I'm open to buyers from anywhere. If shipping to your location turns out to be way pricier than shipping to Canada/CONUS, we can negotiate.

These are not FCFS -- I'm going to sleep and I'll handle messages in the morning. Leave a comment below and then send me a private message. **Do not use Reddit chat!** I will not reply to Reddit chats.

Hi MM,

I switched over to a Space65 CV. Now I’m trying to sell off my E8.5. It’s E-White, with PVD Silver Accent, Hotswap and Solder PCB, Titanium plate, Black Weight and a sheet of black neoporene anti vibration pad between the pcb and case. I used the Hakko FR 301 to desolder the switched for the solder PCB. Here is a link of how the board sounds with Zealios V2 ([LINK](https://soundcloud.com/zephy-iris/e85-ti-plate-lubed-filmed-67g-zealios-case-padding-spacebar-foam)) and NOS Vint Blacks ([LINK](https://soundcloud.com/zephy-iris/e85-ti-plate-lubed-filmed-nos-vint-blacks-zeal-stab-spacebar-foam-stab-foam-case-neoporene-pad)). I’ll be shipping this out Friday via UPS insured. Looking for $825 shipped.

Hello friends,

Looking to trade/sell some stuff that I don't use quite as much as I would like. Not looking to sell the Keycult atm - just looking to see if I can get some interesting trades.

Not FCFS - HIGHLY prioritizing local deals/trades/sales. I am in 92782 (socal) for your reference, I'd be more than happy to drive to you or work something out.

If it's not striked out, it is available! I will try and update the status of all items  as soon as I can.

I highly prefer Discord chat over reddit, but please do PM me your discord username here, on reddit, so I know who to add back. Ramen Champ#1234 - also feel free to join my [discord channel](https://discord.gg/Qb5j3mnPQq)

Feel free to ask any questions.

**RAMA U80-A - MOON GREY ($1050 shipped) (hot swap edition) new**

* The case and weight's QC on this particular board looks flawless. I have 3 colors of this board and this is the best one.
* Comes with everything provided in their base kit, no add-ons
   * Please view pictures and agree before purchase

**Grid 600 Purple PRESS module - ($110 shipped) new**

* Never used with box and wrapping

~~**GMK 8008 base kit - ($290 shipped) new** sold~~

* Opened but never used or mounted

~~**GMK 9009 - ($185 shipped) new** sold~~

* Opened to inspect space bars. This batch seemed quite good and very similar to my older GMKs from 2018.
   * Mounted both and the sound was good on both Zeal and GMK stabs. Was wiped down and put back into the trays. Pictures provided
* Comes with tray and sleeve with original wrapping

**Kono Kira Keyboard - ($150 shipped)**

* Used lightly for 6 months as a 3rd keyboard, great condition
* Aluminum edition
* Does not come with keys or switches, only the case and plate stabs
* There is a quirk and I did not spend too much time trying to figure it out, YMMV
   * Not flashed with latest firmware, updating may fix the issue
   * When  I purchased the keyboard, I noticed that on my desktop PC, the keyboard  would act weird at times depending on the cord I used. When I pressed  downwards on the cord and wiggled it, the keyboard would slightly  disconnect and reconnect immediately. This seemed to also reset the LED  setting.
      * This only happened when I wiggled the cord, not when I am using the keyboard.
   * When  I tested this on another cord, it would not occur on one of them but it  did occur on 2 different cords. (Meaning, it occurred on 2 of my cords  but not on one of them; total of 3 cords tested)
   * When I tested this on a macOS using a cord that was causing the issue, it would not occur
   * Regardless of this issue, the keyboard works well
   * Due to this reason, I am pricing it a little lower. Please make sure to agree to this before purchasing.

Hey there,

I am currently selling GMK Dots for 290€ + shipping. I bought it on [r/mm](https://www.reddit.com/r/mm/) myself and am looking to make my money back. The caps have no shine as can be seen in the timestamp.

I am also looking to buy the GMK Olivia Spacebars kit and the Keycravings Uruk WoB Artisan. You can hit me up with a trade or selling offer.

Would prefer buyers from the EU because of the lower likelihood of hiccups while shipping and less PayPal fees. If shipping is covered and you are willing to take the risk of international shipping, I will consider shipping internationally.

Also, only purchase the set if you want it immediately. GMK Dots R2 is supposed to go into Groupbuy-Phase early next year.

Have a nice day!","[EU-DE] [H] GMK Dots, PayPal [W] Paypal, Olivia++ Spacebars, Keycravings Uruk WoB Artisan"

E-White Hirose Evelyn = [@-@](https://imgur.com/a/ufBU36S)

And some additional [Take me home](https://imgur.com/a/Nu9VOzl) photos and videos .

This is a personal Engraved E-White Bahm Evelyn (Korean Alice Clone) . It is built with Hirose Orange switches that are filmed with Orange TX films , all lubed with Krytox 205G0 . I sourced them myself from Japan and they feel incredible to type on . The stabilizers are band-aid modified and lubed & I used a combo of red and black to match the style and the appearance of a Hirose switch . The wire is gold plated to match the brass reinforcement plate . LED's are sky-blue ,Pcb is Adelais Undergrow RGB programable by VIA or QMK .

Evelyn comes with an original brass plate used for the prototype (there are scratches on it ) , aluminum plate comes with a unique color combination and an extra fr4 matte black plate and an extra Adelais Arc-En-Ciel Pcb.

Evelyn has heat treatment black lines on the polished brass weight but no noticeable scratches on it. There are scratches on the inside of the top and bottom housing where the screws go in , otherwise on the exterior there are no visible scratches.

# Item #1 GMK Olive Base Kit

Good condition, haven't used it in awhile, best I can recall I used it for about a week, maybe 2. No obvious shine that I can see.  (Apologies for the out of order keys but will ship in baggies anyways)

# Item #2 HuB 40% keyset by TheVan Keyboards

Also good condition, not used all that long, probably a week or two as well. Profile is excellent but I have a preference for Cherry and KAT(also legends, though not entirely necessary, would be nice). I should note that the spacebars are a little loose but that is how they came. They are made from ABS I believe.

This should fit most 40% boards.

# Shipping

Shipping as stated for USPS priority. Will ship in bags though for Olive if you really want it I still have the original GMK tray for it(long kind) with some missing pull tabs.

# International Shipping

I am open to shipping internationally, please provide your location, but for a rough estimate of the price, based on the size + weight + the cost last time I had to mail something international, you're probably looking at around $30-$40 for priority mail; that said since these are keycaps I believe there was a cheaper option for lighter weight items at the tradeoff of shipping speed. Regardless I will let you know your options once I know your location.

Please remember that due to COVID-19 there are possible restrictions depending on where you live, please be sure to [double check the service alerts for USPS](https://about.usps.com/newsroom/service-alerts/international/welcome.htm).

Need to get rid of some of my collection.

To my knowledge, the PC Kira60v2 was from a private group-buy in Singapore and features a top-mount design.

This board has marks on the bottom of the case from exposure to a solvent (at least, that's what the previous owner told me). The brass plate has been tarnished--I've tried cleaning this with 70% ethanol and had some progress but was too lazy to continue. Please see the timestamp photos. These aren't visible once built and on your desk.

Will come with a brass plate, a kbd6x hotswap + underglow pcb and GMK screw-in stabs. Does not come with keycaps or switches, the picture is there for reference.

Asking: $715 shipped, OBO.

Would prefer CONUS, and local is 92507. Please comment/PM, and if you have questions let me know.",[US-CA] [H] PC Kira60 v2 HHKB Layout + PCB [W] Paypal

~~Hey mechmarket,~~

~~I'm looking for GMK Honeywell in a mint condition (no shine) and I have two options for trade. GMK Burgundy r3 is sealed. GMK Phosphorous was opened and typed on for a few days (no shine, like new). I've noticed scratch on the 6.25u spacebar and I already got replacement cap from GMK (via vendor).~~

Hello,

I have a set of GMK 8008 Base + Accent.

Will be shipped in bags. 

Looking for 360 shipped/350 local (92618).

Hi everyone. I have a set of HASR0 keycaps here that I picked up last year. Unfortunately, their previous users made terrible things to it, they removed some of the red legends by scratching. Then they added some legends of their own. Caps that had their original red legends removed are: \`, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, pipe and /. Now the caps are somewhat ruined. I tried to clean the handwritten legends with dishsoap, but failed. I think giving it a go in an ultrasonic cleaner would help a lot. There is a small (burn?) mark between HJN keys. Other than that, some keys are shined to a mirror polish, namely the arrows, enter key and numpad. With that said, I don't know what to ask for it in terms of money, so I'd like to trade it for something.

Full disclosure, I have another 3000SAV red Cyrillic keyset that I want to trade in the future and another HASR0 that I might trade too. I just wanted to deal with one dyesub set at a time, to have less confusion.

The other thing that I have is a set of FAME Alps doubleshot keycaps with pad-printed (or silk-screen) cyrillic legends. Despite the fact that the caps are shiny, the pad print didn't wear off completely. I'm assuming that it was made by Tai-Hao themselves. Please note that some of the keys are pad printed and not doubleshot on the main legend (Backspace, capslock, numpad +...).

Now for the stuff that I'm interested in. I'll list it in order of preference:

* Topre HiPro Keycaps / Keyboards;
* HHKB;
* SKCM Brown alps switches;
* GMK caps;
* Other offers?

edit: added the list of damaged keys.","[UA] [H] Cherry Cyrillic dye-sub keycaps (HASR0), FAME Alps Cyrillic keycaps [W] HiPro caps / boards, hhkb, skcm brown switches, other"

\* Buying zilent v2 in smaller quantities is a tad bit more expensive per switch due to the same shipping price, packaging as 70 or 110 switches. You can 20 switches too, but it will be even more expensive 38 eu for 20 switches (of course shipping and pp fees included).

PLEASE READ. FAQ:

* Should I leave comment before pming?
   * YES. Please COMMENT before PMing me, without comment chats will be ignored.
* You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually  include shipping and pp fees.
* How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster.
* Are prices correct?
   * All prices are correct.
* How are you selling?
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product - product get the one who pays.","[EU-LT] [H] Leopold FC660C Black (Silenced), KBD67 MKII HOTSWAP V2 BLUE GREY, Drop Alt Space Grey, SPACE CABLES Mito Mono Grey Cable, Zilent V2 (62g), Cherry MX Red, Other [W] PayPal"

PRICE: Shipped EMS $110 Worldwide via PayPal
TRADE: GMK Metropolis Signs (Novelties) + I pay you extra

This is from the Southpaw75 GB but via the Asia proxy so that means there are a few differences.

- PCB is black instead of green
- microcontroller is micro-usb instead of C (you can still add your own type-c micro controller if you want - I did)
- QMK profile is different
- NOT presoldered (I can solder for you one board if you want except for the microcontroller since it covers some switch pins)

[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/qUvQQyZ)

Includes:
- top and bottom plate
- microcontroller x2
- PCB x2 with resistors for 2 PCBs
- standoffs and screws
- bottom pads
- black standoffs (originally not included)
- reset switches x2 (originally not included)

I still have one and use it as a daily driver. I do recommend getting some taller bump ons for the rear or taller standoffs to provide some typing angle. I use some rubber half circle shaped rubber seals. Can include the extra of that if you want. Then with GMK or similar profiles, the angle was pretty nice.

GMK Serika: Only used on a 65% board. There's mild shine on more commonly used alphas, but not much imo.  Less used keys exhibit no shine at all.

GMK Red Samurai: Only used Nishi and some modifiers on a 65% board. It's in better condition than Serika since I didn't use it as much.

Japanese Cherry PBT: Never used it. It has enough keys to cover a standard 104-key layout.","[US-CA][H] GMK Serika R1 Core + Space bars, GMK Red Samurai R1 Base + Nishi + Spacebars, Japanese Cherry PBT Dyesub [W] PayPal, Local"

1. Green Kbd fans 5 degree build

I built this board for fun and has not been used to type on. It has a XD-60 that has been mill-maxed, lubed milky gateron yellows, a brass plate, and some neoprene foam. The board has some clone GMK Bento keycaps, but can be excluded from the purchase if preferred. The case itself is flawless with no dings or scratches.  Price: $254 shipped OBO

2. PBT Islander Base + Novelties + Fix kit

I purchased this set, but took a different route with my build and will no longer fit the color scheme. I am open to trade this mainly for gmk sets, (dots, cafe, 8008 preferred), and will add any necessary paypal. Feel free to shoot me an offer. I am also willing to sell this for $245 shipped.

Welcome to Donut's ""Ah fuck, still the only one actually making some money in the household cause Covid layoffs"" offloading of stuff round 1. Prices are based on what I could find info on, but also OBO, so hit me with offers cause I'm trying to be flexible. Shipping for artisans is $4/CONUS for singles, calculated by location for multiples.

https://i.imgur.com/Zf7hqUj.jpg Artisans visual guide

Krytone Sheep - Bundle only, $420(heh) - Krytone's old Topre stem that fits on most MX stems as well. I'm super fond of these caps and I've been super hesitant to let this group collection go, but artisans don't pay the water bill. Could also be persuaded into a trade for a Virpil Constellation Alpha(R) + WarBRD base if someone were so inclined. 

Krytone Chickeys - $32/ea - Some are Krytone's aforementioned Topre/MX stems, some are MX only, as labeled in the timestamps. Part of my overall Krytone-centric collection. 

Krytone D'mons - $32/ea - All MX only. More Krytone stuff I've been holding onto for years now, including one I stopped in the middle of a 4hr drive home from uni to nab. ALL 3 SOLD.

SUK Snapper ""Roastmallow""  - $70 - MX stem. My first artisan raffle win I've held onto almost four years now.

Crimson Cadet - SOLD - $270 shipped insured conus OBO - Base kit, opened but never taken out of the trays. I had full intentions to do an entire themed build with this set until 2020 hit full stride. I'm immensely upset that I'm needing to sell it, but I'm actually on the verge of being literally out of money at this point.","[US-NC] [H] Artisans(Krytone, SUK), GMK Crimson Cadet [W] PayPal"

Hello, back with another post! Lots of keysets coming in soon, so I gotta make some room Please read all the details of each listing carefully, as I will 100% roast you if you ask me anything that I cover in the details. I normally would strike through product descriptions, but I will leave them up to help guide those who are looking to purchase any of the items listed below. Feel free to offer, I tend to be pretty flexible on prices.

All prices below include USPS First Class shipping unless otherwise stated. I can ship to all of the US, including PR, so no need to ask me if you're from AK, HI, or PR (shipping prices may or may not change so we'll have to discuss in PMs if needed). I am also open to shipping to proxy/forwarding service addresses for all you international customers. If you are international and would like me to send directly to your address instead of a proxy/forwarding service, please let me know and I will give you a shipping quote.

Priority for responding to offers will be as follows:

 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing for asking price. This will get you an invoice as soon as I finish reading your message.
 * PayPal email included in PM with price offer for any one item or combo of items. If I accept your offer, I will send you an invoice immediately. Otherwise, I'll respond to your PM.


Outside of the listed conditions, I'll check based on when you comment **and** PM. The PM is absolutely necessary for the sale of these items. Please understand that if you as a buyer and I agree on a price and you back out of the purchase right after I send the invoice, I will refuse to sell anything to you in the future (yes, that includes if you offer me something like $300 on something that I'm selling for much less). 

 **Do not use the chat function**, I honestly don't know how you are taken to the chat function when the bot's verification post gives you a link to PM sellers. I will ignore you and you won't be in consideration for anything until you send me a PM. I will also ignore you if you do not comment before sending a PM.

If I don't respond, it's likely because I've gone to bed for the night. I will get to all messages accompanying comments in a timely manner. Thank you for your time.",[US-CA] [H] GMK Dots base kit [W] PayPal

I was planning on using the Space65 but I realized that I didn't really like it as much. So the build is still wrapped in the plastic. I did take the liberty of installing 7305s as I was going to use it. I installed 7305s everywhere except for the 1x on the backspace since it sits on the same level as the stabilizers and doesn't work. If you want, I can install them for you.

Hi everyone,

I build, repair and fine tune keyboards. I’ve built and sold a list of keyboards already. You can check out my pass posts as reference. As you can see, I strive to create the best feel and sounding keyboard possible. I generally use the top-rated switches on my builds, but I do mix it up sometimes for more budget friendly builds. I also have many upcoming projects as well (CB87, IKKI68, Think65v2, Time 80, KBD Keyboards, and etc.) so stay tuned!

Hello, decided to sell some of my collection:

~~**RAMA U80-A - MOON GREY ($1060 shipped) (hot swap edition) new sold**~~ 

* The case and weight's QC on this particular board looks flawless. I have 3 colors of this board and this is the best one.
* Comes with everything provided in their base kit, no add-ons
   * Please view pictures and agree before purchase

**Grid 600 Purple PRESS module - ($115 shipped) new**

* Never used with box and wrapping

**~~GMK Darling base kit - ($280 shipped) sold~~**

* Sealed and new

**GMK 9009 - ($190 shipped)**

* New
* Opened to inspect space bars. This batch seemed quite good and very similar to my older GMKs from 2018.
   * Mounted both and the sound was good on both Zeal and GMK stabs. Was wiped down and put back into the trays. Pictures provided
* Comes with tray and sleeve with original wrapping

**Kono Kira Keyboard - ($160 shipped)**

**\*made a typo, this is the 99 key edition, not 96\***

* Used lightly for 6 months as a 3rd keyboard, great condition
* Aluminum edition
* Does not come with keys or switches, only the case and plate stabs
* There is a quirk and I did not spend too much time trying to figure it out, YMMV
   * Not flashed with latest firmware, updating may fix the issue
   * When I purchased the keyboard, I noticed that on my desktop PC, the keyboard would act weird at times depending on the cord I used. When I pressed downwards on the cord and wiggled it, the keyboard would slightly disconnect and reconnect immediately. This seemed to also reset the LED setting.
      * This only happened when I wiggled the cord, not when I am using the keyboard.
   * When I tested this on another cord, it would not occur on one of them but it did occur on 2 different cords. (Meaning, it occurred on 2 of my cords but not on one of them; total of 3 cords tested)
   * When I tested this on a macOS using a cord that was causing the issue, it would not occur
   * Regardless of this issue, the keyboard works well
   * Due to this reason, I am pricing it a little lower. Please make sure to agree to this before purchasing.

**Fusion60 HHKB**

I have a Fusion60 in hhkb layout with extra carbon fiber half plate, and a brass plate as well. Comes with the stock pcb soldered with outemu silent clear sky(clear top and sky bottom) lubbed with 3203 and they have u4 stems. I bought them switches from Daily Clack and ended up being super expensive due to 20 euro shipping and then 40 euros on customs fees.

The stabilizers in the board are the durock clears.

The solder job could be better as there are 2 wire jumps . The switches are very good tactiles and the board is amazing, but I find the typing angle uncomfortable for me, and maybe the fact that I put SA keycap didn't help as well.

There are 2 wire jumps in total, which makes the pcb in a not so great overall condition. The price is adjusted a little bit as well. The board is compatible with most standard 60% pcb in tsangan layout, so it could be replaced by a dz60 without a problem or a hs60 hhkb, cannonkeys instant 60 for example. Any questions feel free to ask.

Right now it is build with a instant60 pcb and durock L7s. the pcb has a few rough sockets and the 'u' one needs a bit of testing when assembling the switch to ensure that the pins make contact with the socket. This is **not included** in the price.

**Drop CTRL**

I have a drop CTRL bought in January and it's been unused since March due to Covid, as I was using it on the office and it stayed there for a while completely unused.

It cost 212 .51 $(191,25€) shipped on drop page + \~70€ customs tax

and the orange acrylic cover was 33€ shipped + 22€ (customs tax)

The switches are holy pandas with the Yok housings in black and halo clear stems, that I lubbed with 3204, and I changed the stabilizers to cherry ones, clipped and lubbed.

The board is like new really, was really lightly used, and as such I'm selling it a little under what I paid, bundled with the acrylic cover.

Might sell barebones only but prefered to sell it as a compete build.

&#x200B;

**KBDFans KBD67MII**

Bought it on mechmarket 1 or 2 months ago, but didn't really like it.

It is the PC hotswap vesion, which is like new, only has a really small scratch on the backweight.

It comes with lubbed durock stabs. I have bought foam from mkultra as well, and have other pom plate.

Evening all!

I have two keyboards to sell.

Firstly, an unused Leopold FC660M which was bought last week brand new. I swapped the switches to C3 Equalz Banana Splits, which have been lubed with Krytox 205, and the springs with Krytox 105. The stabilisers have also been lubed with Krytox 205. I have only used the keyboard to ensure it is working correctly, which it is. It will be shipped in the original packaging with all relevant accessories.

I am asking for £215 which includes postage within the UK, and PayPal fees.


Secondly, a built Tofu with Yok Mint Holy Pandas on a DZ60, with a carbon fibre plate, and with lubed, clipped, band aid modded GMK stabilisers. Tofu has a layer of foam inside. This comes with the keycaps shown which are HK Gaming PBT. This keyboard has been used for less than a year. There are a couple of marks on the Tofu which are easily seen in the photos. 

I am asking for £215 which again, includes shipping within the UK, and PayPal fees.

Hey there,

I am currently selling GMK Dots for 285€ + shipping. I bought it on [r/mm](https://www.reddit.com/r/mm/) myself and am looking to make my money back. 285€ - PayPal fees is a bit less than what I‘ve paid for it. The caps have no shine as can be seen in the timestamp.

I am also looking to buy the GMK Olivia Spacebars kit and the GMK Ursa Tessie Rama Novelty. You can hit me up with a trade or selling offer.

Would prefer buyers from the EU because of the lower likelihood of hiccups while shipping. If shipping is covered and you are willing to take the risk of international shipping, I will consider shipping internationally. Please also consider that because of additional PayPal fees for purchases from non-EU countries, the price of the set will increase according to the increase in PayPal fees. I am willing to cover a part of the increase, but not all of it.

Also, only purchase the set if you want it immediately. GMK Dots R2 is supposed to go into Groupbuy-Phase early next year.

Have a nice day!","[EU-DE] [H] GMK Dots, PayPal [W] Paypal, Olivia++ Spacebars, RAMA Tessie cap for GMK Ursa"

Hi everyone. I have a set of HASR0 keycaps here that I picked up last year. Unfortunately, their previous users made terrible things to it, they removed some of the red legends by scratching. Then they added some legends of their own. Now the caps are somewhat ruined. I tried to clean the handwritten legends with dishsoap, but failed. I think giving it a go in an ultrasonic cleaner would help a lot. There is a small (burn?) mark between HJN keys. Other than that, some keys are shined to a mirror polish, namely the arrows, enter key and numpad. With that said, I don't know what to ask for it in terms of money, so I'd like to trade it for something.

Full disclosure, I have another 3000SAV red Cyrillic keyset that I want to trade in the future and another HASR0 that I might trade too. I just wanted to deal with one dyesub set at a time, to have less confusion.

The other thing that I have is a set of FAME doubleshot keycaps with pad-printed (or silk-screen) cyrillic legends. Despite the fact that the caps are shiny, the pad print didn't wear off completely. I'm assuming that it was made by Tai-Hao themselves. Please note that some of the keys are pad printed and not doubleshot on the main legend (Backspace, capslock, numpad +...).

Now for the stuff that I'm interested in. I'll list it in order of preference:

* Topre HiPro Keycaps / Keyboards;
* HHKB;
* SKCM Brown alps switches;
* GMK caps;
* Other offers?

UPD: added info about pad printed caps on FAME.","[UA] [H] Cherry Cyrillic dye-sub keycaps (HASR0), FAME Cyrillic keycaps [W] Trades"

Prices are in USD. All items will be shipped via SingPost, with tracking. Shipping cost is comparable, regardless of destination throughout the world, except for Malaysia, Japan and Brunei.

Prices are highly negotiable. These are all sentimental items to me, and I worry more about them being in good hands than money. It should also be noted that **these cases will fit any version of Planck PCB or Planck-compatible PCBs** like the Shark or JNAO, if you'd like to actually use them.

---

## ACE XT-40 (full kit)

Includes:

* Case: black in colour. In relatively great condition. Expect regular wears of usage (which are incredibily difficult to photograph). Nothing in particular that will turn your head or raise your eyebrows.
* Plate: the original matte black plate of the package. In great condition. Again, regular wears of usage.
* PCB: the original package item. Runs on `bootmapper`/`ps2arGB`. Probably will not work on QMK. Was desoldered once. Mini USB port is a bit rusty.

**Asking for 120 USD shipped**.

## ACE XT-40 (case and acrylic plate only)

A replacement case for the one above. The edges are much sharper and pretty much unused, though it comes it minor anodization imperfections inside and below the case. The package does not come with PCB or plate, but I will throw in a custom-cut black acrylic plate, just for this particular case.

~~**Asking for $80 shipped.**~~ Sold for asking price.

## NL-Bullet (case + 2x plates)

The white powder variant. Minor scratches over the logo at the bottom, otherwise in great condition. The two smaller feet have been lost due to garbage glue; have replaced them with my own 3M rubber feet.

Also includes the original brass plate, which has a terrible fit and broke some of my switches. To compensate, I'm throwing in a custom cut black acrylic plate.

No PCB is inlcuded.

~~**Asking for $100.**~~ Sold for $115. Yes, it's more than the asking price. Wholesome story: I found the perfect Planck enthusiast this case should be with.

## GMK 8008, obscure kit only

Not much to say. Still sealed and have not been even opened. Will cover most 40% boards  and the Alice.

Hi, I impulsively traded my old GMK set for dots and realized that it did not match the keyboards that I'm using, hence I'm selling it off. Never mounted the dots myself. The keycaps have no visible shine on them as well.

Looking for $400 SGD + shipping worldwide OBO SOLD

Priority goes to local buyers/east asia buyers.

All kits will be shipped in bags internationally and shipped in trays locally. International buyers will have to top up if they wish to have the keycaps shipped with the tray.

Standard alphas are unused. Banderole has a little water damage from my water heater shooting out water in the middle of the night, but only mildly misshapen from that.

|HHKB Pro 2 (45g)|Used sporadically for a couple years, and then early this year I lubed the housing rails with 3204 and stabs with 3204 on the housings and 206g00 on the wires, and silenced with Deskeys #3 rings. Feels and sounds nice, but I need my left Control. Comes with an R1 and R4 tricolor HKP blank, and does not include the original Esc and Fn key (somehow misplaced them).|$205|Y|
|~~SKCM Salmon (100)~~|~~Desoldered from an AT101. They were originally very dusty, but after ultrasonic cleaning them (in distilled water with denture tabs) they are super, super clean. I'm not very experienced with Alps, but these feel quite smooth, though there is slight upstroke click on some switches. I'd say 7.5 to 8/10 if I had to give a score, but take that with a grain of salt. Have not tested after cleaning.~~|~~$80~~|~~SOLD~~|

I've stock piled way too much keyboard stuff and have decided its long past time to trim down. Some of this stuff was purchased new from retailers. Some was purchased via resell from r/mm and similar. All of the GMK is going because even though I love the look of all of these sets, PBT is the better plastic 😬. Local pickup also available in Mid City Los Angeles.

Hey there,

Need to sell the boards below.

**KBD67 mkii Kit ($330+shipping) -** [**Pictures**](https://imgur.com/a/PhJF65L)

* Cerakoted Crimson Red by OC Custom Coating
* Used keyboard. I've factored in part of the cerakoting cost, but otherwise selling at a decent price imo. The board and case are both flawless with no cosmetic or functional issues. Board is a bit of a treasure, but I need it to go right now.
* **WILL NOT SHIP BUILT.** It will ship as a kit ONLY with the case, extra PCB, brass plate, and case/plate foams shown in the timestamp and below. Will include all the original screws and standoffs, though I suggest not using the standoffs for a much better experience. Can include a replacement 1.5mm hex wrench on request, but I do not have the original wrench from KBDfans.
* Previously built with Gateron Ink Blacks and Durock Stabilizers on an FR4 plate. If you're interested in the FR4 plate/switches, please include that in the PM.
* Pictures of [Case/Plate Foam, Extra HOTSWAP PCB and Plate](https://imgur.com/a/7Zfpcro)
* I can reset the keymapping for you if you want, else will provide DFU info.

I have multiple sets of linear L&F switches that could be included with the boards. Not looking to sell any of the switches or keycaps shown otherwise. Please reply below and PM if interested.

\* Buying zilent v2 in smaller quantities is a tad bit more expensive per switch due to the same shipping price, packaging as 70 or 110 switches. You can 20 switches too, but it will be even more expensive 38 eu for 20 switches (of course shipping and pp fees included).

   * YES. Please COMMENT before PMing me, without comment chats will be ignored.

   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually  include shipping and pp fees.
* How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster.

Hi MM -

**First:** [Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/5M2eSVF)

As promised another listing as part of raising funds. This is a hard one to part with, it's without doubt the best board I've owned. I've tried to show it as best as possible with the images, and also 2 sound tests - one by me today and one from when the board was built (by someone far more experienced than me).

**Spec:**

\- TX65 Grey, ISO  
\- Switches are Panda base, BSUN top, Zealio stem, SPRiT springs (68g), 72g on space and enter.  
\- Switches and stabilisers are lubed.  
\- GMK screw-in stabilisers with SPRiT gold-plated wires.  
\- Small strip of foam under the spacebar for mild dampening  
\- Orginal TX bag, TX microfibre, TX caps, spare screws  
\- Matching 3m USB to Mini-USB, and extra microfibre (good for covering when not in use).

**Condition:**

Generally excellent. Case has no visible flaws. The brass weight has one minor blemish that can only be seen in certain light, I've tried my best to capture this on the photos. Mileage is low, I've used it mostly for glamour shots but the switches are nicely bedded in and smooth.

**Feel:**

Switches were not cheap to put together but are a great combination, BSUN tops were used to be LED friendly. Nice thock in the sound and really tactile.

**Price and Shipping:**

Selling for cost of parts, I paid £600 in all (excluding build and shipping). Drop to £575.  
Will ship anywhere. but EU/UK preferred due to weight.

GMK Alter, various keys (incorrect colors) | Incorrect-colored keys from GMK Alter spanning base kit, novelties, and spacebars. See photo album for more pics of what exactly you'll be getting. What would you use these for? Probably to see if you like the feel of GMK in case you don't have a GMK set yet, or you just wanna try something silly. **PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE BUYING.** Please offer, as I really would like to avoid having to cancel invoices on this item. | ~~$75 shipped USPS Priority~~ | **SOLD FOR ASKING PRICE** ... somehow
Durock 62g gold springs | Harvested from Alpacas while spring-swapping them, I have no use for these. | ~~$8 shipped or free with purchase of either item listed above~~ | **BUNDLED WITH GMK ALTER KEYS**

Priority for responding to offers will be as follows:

 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing for asking price. This will get you an invoice as soon as I finish reading your message.
 * PayPal email included in PM with price offer for any one item or combo of items. If I accept your offer, I will send you an invoice immediately. Otherwise, I'll respond to your PM.


Outside of the listed conditions, I'll check based on when you comment **and** PM. The PM is absolutely necessary for the sale of these items. Please understand that if you as a buyer and I agree on a price and you back out of the purchase right after I send the invoice, I will refuse to sell anything to you in the future (yes, that includes if you offer me something like $300 on something that I'm selling for much less). 

 **Do not use the chat function**, I honestly don't know how you are taken to the chat function when the bot's verification post gives you a link to PM sellers. I will ignore you and you won't be in consideration for anything until you send me a PM. I will also ignore you if you do not comment before sending a PM.

If I don't respond, it's likely because I've gone to bed for the night. I will get to all messages accompanying comments in a timely manner. Thank you for your time.","[US-CA] [H] GMK Dots, GMK Alter (incorrect alphas/ novelties/spacebars), 62g Durock springs [W] PayPal"

Hi everyone,

I build, repair and fine tune keyboards. I’ve built and sold a list of keyboards already. You can check out my pass posts as reference. As you can see, I strive to create the best feel and sounding keyboard possible. I generally use the top-rated switches on my builds, but I do mix it up sometimes for more budget friendly builds. I also have many upcoming projects as well (CB87, IKKI68, Think65v2, Time 80, KBD Keyboards, and etc.) so stay tuned!

Hey mechmarket! I impulsively bought this GMK Dots set from another user and I only bought em cause I thought they looked cool lol. I am selling this as I don’t use this keycap set and I would like to use the money for Christmas gifts. They are in mint condition. Keep in mind, the seal in the picture has been broken off and has been mounted once or twice from the previous owner. I personally haven’t used or mounted these at all, only to look at. I inspected and these have no shine or wear at all and I am asking for $340 Shipped! I can negotiate pricing within reason as well. (shipping to CONUS)

Edit: All sold, thanks for reading! And I'm still on the hunt for a 3070

~~Hi all,~~

~~I have a couple things to sell.~~

~~PBT Vaporwave + Matching coiled cable - $90 shipped (not looking to split right now)~~

~~Bought the keycaps from another user here and used for a couple months. No sign of any wear or shine. Coiled cable is from Dream-Cables (Neon Turquoise Paracord, Carbon Techflex, Lavender Purple Heatshrink, 6"" coils, 5' length, USB C to USB A)~~

&#x200B;

~~GMK Zhuyin BoW - $85 shipped~~

~~Opened just to check the contents. Thought I would use it with another white keycap set I have but it doesn't quite match (always do your research!). Never mounted or typed on, just trying to make back what I paid + shipping.~~

~~SOLD~~

Mizu is SOLD for asking

Welcome to Donut's ""Ah fuck, still the only one actually making some money in the household cause Covid layoffs"" offloading of stuff round 1. Prices are based on what I could find info on, but also OBO, so hit me with offers cause I'm trying to be flexible. Shipping for artisans is $4/CONUS for singles, calculated by location for multiples.

Krytone Sheep - Bundle only, $420(heh) - Krytone's old Topre stem that fits on most MX stems as well. I'm super fond of these caps and I've been super hesitant to let this group collection go, but artisans don't pay the water bill.  

Krytone Chickeys - $32/ea - Some are Krytone's aforementioned Topre/MX stems, some are MX only, as labeled in the timestamps. Part of my overall Krytone-centric collection. 

Krytone D'mons - $32/ea - All MX only. More Krytone stuff I've been holding onto for years now, including one I stopped in the middle of a 4hr drive home from uni to nab. ALL 3 SOLD.

SUK Snapper ""Roastmallow""  - $70 - MX stem. My first artisan raffle win I've held onto almost four years now.

Crimson Cadet - $275 shipped insured conus OBO - Base kit, opened but never taken out of the trays. I had full intentions to do an entire themed build with this set until 2020 hit full stride.

Shipping rates:

• I’ll have to use an expensive expedited service, since the cheaper national carrier has been [rekt by Covid.](https://pos.com.my/journal/sed-ut-perspiciatis-unde-omnis-iste-natus-error-sit-voluptatem-accusantium-doloremque-4.html)

• For reference, shipping to CONUS starts at $55.

• Shipping price will remain the same ($55) even if you purchase everything because the combined weight / volume is below the minimum threshold.

Mounted for a week and wifey surprisingly took a higher interest in my GMK Sandstorm kit. As this was meant for her, I guess it's time to sell to fund another kit. Zero shine whatsoever, barely typed on as she can't use computer for long periods of time due to pregnancy.

Edit 1 at 10:45PM THESE WILL BE SHIPPED FROM CALIFORNIA, SORRY I COPY AND PASTED ANOTHER TITLE FROM MECHMARKET AND FORGOT TO EDIT LOCATION

Edit 2 at 11:53PM Hi everything has sold. I apologize if I did not get to everyone! Have a wonderful week. 

Hi selling some products I will not be using.

~~NK Vaporware- Asking 60 shipped mounted once and typed on for less than 30 minutes. Purchased to see how it'd look really. Not available on Novelkeys at the moment, roughly the same price you'd pay MSRP with shipping, checking right now and to order the NK WoB would roughly be 66.33. Using NK WoB as reference since you can't add vaporware to cart. Pricing breakdown on their website as follow. SOLD~~

~~$50 keycaps, $11.45 USPS priority mail, and $4.88 tax~~

~~NK WoB- Same reasoning as NK Vaporware, asking $60 shipped this set has not been mounted at all. - Currently pending SOLD~~

~~GMK WoB (Missing spacebars + 3 white keycaps)- Asking $70 shipped. Purchased originally from Drop, probably received it 2-3 weeks ago? Reason for purchasing I wanted the spacebars and the white keycaps it comes with, if you've seen my previous post I was looking for black spacebars in a specific GMK colorware so I decided to purchase GMK WoB to get the spacebars haha, also took interest in the white keycaps that it comes with. Looking to get 70 shipped which I believe is more than fair considering the missing spacebar and 3 white keycaps. If you're in need of spacebars originative still has GMK spacebars, nothing in black though but other colors if you wanted something more colorful!- currently pending~~

~~NK VAPORWARE- 60 SHIPPED~~

~~NK WOB- 60 SHIPPED~~

~~GMK WOB (MISSING KEYS)- 70 SHIPPED~~

These will be shipped via USPS. I will try my best to get it dropped off to my post office Friday/ Saturday. If I am unable to then it will be first thing Monday morning, if you're not okay with this then please do not purchase. As always, please comment before PM'ing. As per usual if you send a chat I will not respond. Thank you! And stay safe!","[US-GA] [H] NK Vaporware, NK WoB, GMK WOB(Missing some keys and spacebars) [W] PayPal"

Hey /mm,

I'm letting my KAT Eternal go due to being disappointed with the quality and legend alignment. I love LoL, Kindred, and the beautiful gradient, but my standards have been ruined by GMK. 

I mounted enough caps on a KBD75V2, typed on it for a few hours, and put the caps back in the trays.

I'd like to trade the KAT Eternal bundle for GMK Darling Base/Spacebars kit + PayPal. PM me if you have both and we can work something out!

*Cable is from Summitcables with the following specs: 5 feet coilless, USB-C to USB-A, Neon Purple Acid paracord, Dark Purple techflex, Purple heatshrink.

I will be prioritizing trades first before looking at outright cash offers.

I also have 90 lubed Kailh Speed Bronze switches.

\-Durrock Stabilizers; tuned and lubed

\-Brass Plate; some small scratches but you can’t see them once you put on the keycaps.

\-Keyboard has seen some light use, looks close to new in my opinion; the pictures accurately reflect its condition.

\*Two choices for **keycaps**:

1. **Brand new GMK Samurai 65%:** $85 *GMK Samurai 65% kit; ships in bags. Included in the standard pricing.*
2. **Used** **GMK Samurai TKL Kit**; ships in tray or bags. Used with some moderate shine on a few keys, check pictures. $65 in Bags, $70 in tray

\-**Red and Black Wristrest:** $70 made by *Artisan Labs*; Lightly used for \~2-3 weeks. Looks fantastic and is comfortable, goes well with the KBD’s typing angle.

Also for sale is an opened set of GMK Fro.yo! Has seen very light use (about two weeks on a secondary board). No shine whatsoever. Includes original packaging as well. Asking $200 OBO for this set!

I added some felt in the bottom for sound dampening and because it has a bit of flex, as not all the standoffs matched up. I also included a pic with keycaps, but keycaps aren't included.~~ **~~FEW PROBLEMS WITH THE BOARD - 1) I think the I hot-swap socket is faulty. Sometimes the key will work, sometimes it won't. It probably needs a new socket. Don't know how to do that. 2) The N hot-swap socket doesn't close all the way. I twisted one of the pins slightly to secure the connection and haven't had a problem since. 3) The right shift switch is a bit wobbly. I'm not sure if it's because the PCB or the plate isn't tight enough.~~** SOLD FOR ASKING

This is a personal Engraved E-White Bahm Evelyn (Korean Alice Clone) . It is built with Hirose Orange switches that are filmed with Orange TX films , all lubed with Krytox 205G0 . I sourced them myself from Japan and they feel incredible to type on . The stabilizers are band-aid modified and lubed & I used a combo of red and black to match the style and the appearance of a Hirose switch . The wire is gold plated to match the brass reinforcement plate . LED's are sky-blue ,Pcb is Adelais Undergrow RGB programable by VIA or QMK .

Evelyn comes with an original brass plate used for the prototype (there are scratches on it ) , aluminum plate comes with a unique color combination and an extra fr4 matte black plate and an extra Adelais Arc-En-Ciel pcb.

Evelyn has heat treatment black lines on the polished brass weight but no noticeable scratches on it. There are scratches on the inside of the top and bottom housing where the screws go in , otherwise on the exterior there are no visible scratches.

This is the blog of the Evelyn maker Bahm , here you can find Evelyn and his other keyboards . He is quite popular in Korea : [Bahm's Naver Blog](https://m.blog.naver.com/PostList.nhn?blogId=hjg7808)

Hello you beautiful sexy people!

StayWired cables from Ontario, Canada here with a spicy new batch of artisan cables!  

As excited as we are, we'll try to keep this post concise.

All our cables are oven baked and reversed coiled for that tight springy goodness that will last a long time. If you need the coil going in the opposite orientation than you see in the picture just let us know!

Here is a [Gallery](https://imgur.com/a/30pWzOq) of our work to give you ideas for color combinations, and some rough pictures of [materials](https://imgur.com/a/GW35aXD) (more coming in) We can remake most of these cables with the materials we currently have in stock.

This is obviously our opinion but we'd like to point out [cable orientation](https://imgur.com/a/7jZLWQD) to people who don't know that they specifically prefer their cable setup a different way.

5$usd shipping to CA & US - Tracking shipping for CA but Untracked shipping for US (tracked available for an additional 10$usd)

Hi, i have a few things to sell! This is not FCFS, I am giving preference to people who bundle things with the keyboard! *(cannot do local meetups bc covid and finals)*

Comment before PM & CONUS only pls!

**KAT Milkshake: $340 + shipping ($310 if bundled with 8x )**

* Alphas, Mods, and fruits
   * i stuffed some foam in the bottom of the space bar can leave in or take out
* 6 of the KAT milkshake fruits are missing since the previous owner kept them for a macro pad. ([picture](https://imgur.com/qL977Rj) shows what keys are missing according to the rows, pls compare to pic from [novelkeys](https://imgur.com/BDOPI8f))
* It will ship in bags since I didn't receive the boxes
* it's used but no shine
* ***\*will not split the kits\****  (i have 3 people currently in line for this since I want to sell it together with the board)

**KBD 8x Mkii** **Included is: $375 + shipping**

**Some notes about the board:**

* Will ship in original box
* The brass weight has a scratch from shipping
* The previous owner stripped 1 screw hole, its one that holds down the weight i didn't know about it until i received the board. but doesn't affect the performance of the board so i didn't really care. i did try to repair it, I used a dremel on the weight to shave some back and used epoxy to make the screw stay.
* PCB I was millmaxing it and I burnt the pads on the right arrow key, but I jumped the pads and now the right arrow key is fully functional and it is still hot-swappable and have had no further issues with it

**L&F** **Silk Black x 88: $75 + shipping ($65 if bundled with 8x)**

What's up everyone!

I'm popping the question on Saturday and I'm trying to trim down on things I've bought recently as I will (hopefully) need the funds to start putting aside for the wedding. Also trying to get a couple of things before I slowly take a step back, so here goes nothing!

&nbsp;

※ All prices are *OBO* meaning that I'll accept lower offers, feel free to negotiate, not that I want higher offers - no need to PM me for something that's pending or gone and try to offer more.

※ Prices include PP fees but don't include shipping (USA should be roughly $40, Canada is a little more, PM me for confirmation);

※ **Should we trade, please keep the declared valued under $20, my country is a bitch in Custom fees (€30 flat + 21% of the total value (items + shipping))**.

&nbsp;

Disclaimer: I am not looking to sell all three - I plan on keeping one so I'll go with what you guys end up asking last.

Hi All,

I've got a NK65ee Frost and GMK Umbra base for sale.

~~The~~ **~~NK65 Entry Edition Frost~~** ~~is barely used. I purchased it new on~~ r/mechmarket~~, tried it once and decided that I didn't like the angle and that I need a numpad. Asking for $130 shipped (CONUS).~~ \***SOLD FOR ASKING PRICE\***

~~The~~ **~~GMK Umbra Base~~** ~~kit is also barely used. After several weeks of fruitless searching for a GMK Phosphorous set, I purchased this kit BNIB on~~ r/mechmarket ~~in the hopes that it would look good on my blue Southpaw 65 Extended (it didn't). It was mounted and typed on once. Asking $250 shipped (CONUS) in box.~~ **\*SOLD FOR ASKING PRICE\***

I'd be VERY INTERESTED a trade for the GMK Phosphorous base, numpad, and spacebar kits. The base and numpad kits are required for me, but the spacebars kits are optional. Depending on which items are involved, I'd be willing to add Paypal G&S on my end to even out the trade.

Please comment before PM.

Thanks for looking, and stay safe!","[US-MD] [H] GMK Umbra Base Kit, NK65 Entry in Frost [W] Paypal G&S or Trade for GMK Phosphorous (Base, Numpad, Spacebar)"

Hi All,

timestamp: [https://imgur.com/a/qdiJ5Kk](https://imgur.com/a/qdiJ5Kk)

Ended up getting another keyboard recently so I am looking to trade this one for a gmk set with spacebars or an artisan or two depending on what they are. The candybar has C3 Lubed stabs in it. Depending on the trade offer I can potentially supply some aqua zilents along with the board. Also has lubed c3 stabs included.

Sets I like: GMK Phantom, Gmk metropolis, GMK Taro, GMK Bento, mizu. Maybe more but those have priority

Artisan wishlist: [https://imgur.com/a/M6fKMpR](https://imgur.com/a/M6fKMpR)

I would 1:1 trade for a lot of those. Feel free to offer anyway even if its not on my list

\* Buying zilent v2 in smaller quantities (20-43) is tad bit more expensive per switch than all 110 due to the same shipping price, packaging as 110. For example 40 switches would be 62 euros (shipping and pp fees included!). For more info pm me.

Please comment before PMing me and sending PM, without comment chats will be ignored.

NOTE: Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. To make it easier I simply include shipping and pp fees. EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually.

All prices are correct.

My rule of selling fcfs: communication first, but if there is no communication from person buying (or any reply/explanation in 12 hours) - paid invoice second.","[EU-LT] [H] KBD67 MKII HOTSWAP V2 BLUE GREY, Leopold FC660C Black (Silenced), SPACE CABLES Mito Mono Cable, Drop Alt, Zilent V2 (62g), Cherry MX Red, Other [W] PayPal"

Hi everyone,

I build, repair and fine tune keyboards. I’ve built and sold a list of keyboards already. You can check out my pass posts as reference. As you can see, I strive to create the best feel and sounding keyboard possible. I generally use the top-rated switches on my builds, but I do mix it up sometimes for more budget friendly builds. I also have many upcoming projects as well (CB87, IKKI68, Think65v2, Time 80, KBD Keyboards, and etc.) so stay tuned!

**Keyboard:\*Black KBD67v2 mkii:**

[Keyboard Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/i58GS4e)

\-JWK/Durrock Soho’s Linear Switches (62g); lubed and filmed

\-Durrock Stabilizers; tuned and lubed

\-Brass Plate; some small scratches but you can’t see them once you put on the keycaps.

\-Keyboard has seen some light use, looks close to new in my opinion; the pictures accurately reflect its condition.

\*Two choices for **keycaps**:

1. **Brand new** GMK Samurai 65% kit; ships in bags. Included in the standard pricing.
2. **Used** GMK Samurai TKL Kit; ships in tray or bags. Used with some moderate shine on a few keys, check pictures. Deduct $35 from price if you want this one.

\***Accessories**: $70 each    (*below what each cost me, I'm not making money on you here)*

[Accessories Picture](https://imgur.com/a/92TqkX8)

\-**Artisan GMK Samurai Aviator Cable** by *Swiftcables*; brand new, USB C, gold ends, gold aviator.

\-**Red and Black Wristrest** made by *Artisan Labs*; Lightly used for \~2-3 weeks. Looks fantastic and is comfortable, goes well with the KBD’s typing angle.

&#x200B;

\***Artisans**: Only a few options this time around; next build will have many, many options.[Artisan Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/vbyL9SW)

1. Latrialum Blood Eater ESC & Fn key *(just the ESC & Fn, not the WASD in some of the pictures)*  \-  $170

&#x200B;

**Prices**:

1. Kbd67 + (brand new 65%) GMK Samurai Keycap Set + Accessories (Wristrest & Cable) = **$590 Shipped**

\- You can add add the blood eater latrialum or not, if so add $170)

\- Subtract $35 if you’d rather have the used Samurai TKL kit.

\-*If you are only interested in a few things then just let me know what you are and if I get enough interest then I can look to part out, but will prioritize full bundle.*

I have a Black Tofu 60 from KBDFans. It has a DZ60 RGB ANSI Hotswap flashed with VIA firmware on it. It has genuine GMK Screw Ins installed. There is both PCB and Case foam from MKUltra and shelf liner in the extra space in the bottom of the case. It comes with a brass plate. The center post on the case was dremeled off to give it a more uniform sound and better flex. There are no scratches on the case. The pcb has a few screw holes that are a bit bent in from screwing them in too tight. Other than that everything works just fine. If you have any questions feel free to ask! I can also throw in some lubed gateron yellows if you want. They are 3 pin smd that have been lubed with 105. They were my first switches so they are a bit nicked up and stuff.

Hi MM -

**First:** [Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/5M2eSVF)

As promised another listing as part of raising funds. This is a hard one to part with, it's without doubt the best board I've owned. I've tried to show it as best as possible with the images, and also 2 sound tests - one by me today and one from when the board was built (by someone far more experienced than me).

**Spec:**

\- TX65 Grey, ISO  
\- Switches are Panda base, BSUN top, Zealio stem, SPRiT springs (68g), 72g on space and enter.  
\- Switches and stabilisers are lubed.  
\- GMK screw-in stabilisers with SPRiT gold-plated wires.  
\- Small strip of foam under the spacebar for mild dampening  
\- Orginal TX bag, TX microfibre, TX caps, spare screws  
\- Matching 3m USB to Mini-USB, and extra microfibre (good for covering when not in use).

**Condition:**

Generally excellent. Case has no visible flaws. The brass weight has one minor blemish that can only be seen in certain light, I've tried my best to capture this on the photos. Mileage is low, I've used it mostly for glamour shots but the switches are nicely bedded in and smooth.

**Feel:**

Switches were not cheap to put together but are a great combination, BSUN tops were used to be LED friendly. Nice thock in the sound and really tactile.

**Album:**

**Price and Shipping:**

Selling for cost of parts, I paid £600 in all (excluding build and shipping). Drop to £575.  
Will ship anywhere. but EU/UK preferred due to weight.

After months of deliberation I have decided to part ways with this board and not keep it. It has never been built and has only been taken out of the box twice once for inspection and another to take the timestamp. Additionally putting my GMK Cafe up for sale.

Sets I am trading:

- ~~GMK Burgundy R3 - Just the base set. I promised a community member on Geekhack that I would send them the wine and grape novelties when my set arrived. I'd still like to honor this agreement even though I am trading, so please keep this in mind if this will be an issue for you.~~ Sold in later post

- ~~GMK DMG R2 - Base + Spacebars.~~ Traded for Honeywell

Sets I am looking for right now:

- GMK Laser - Base + Novelties

- GMK Nautilus - Base + Novelties

- GMK Chocolatier - Base + Novelties

- GMK Skeletor

- ~~GMK Honeywell (Specifically R1 for the text+icon mods)~~

- GMK Minimal - Really just want the base set, but I won't turn down the numpad if you don't want to split it

I'd prefer to have the trays with these if possible. 

CONUS Only. I am only interested in trades at the moment. Sets don't have to be pristine, but I'd like ones that have fairly minimal shine. Thanks!","[US-TX][H] GMK Burgundy, GMK DMG [W] Trades"

Hello, r/mechmarket

Today I am clearing out some of the boards, keycaps, switches, deskmat, wrist rest for another build in the future.

Will be using paypal g&s and all prices include paypal fees and shipping.

I will be only shipping to CONUS as shipping international is a bit difficult with the current situation.

If any of the prices seem unreasonable, feel free to send an offer as well.

Please comment and send me a PM!

Hey there,

I am currently selling GMK Dots for 285€ + shipping.
I bought it on r/mm myself and am looking to make my money back. 285€ - PayPal fees is a bit less than what I‘ve paid for it. The caps have no shine as can be seen in the timestamp. 


I am also looking to buy GMK Olivia Light Base Set, the Spacebars kit and the GMK Ursa Tessie Rama Novelty. You can hit me up with a trade or a selling offer.

Would prefer buyers from the EU because of the lower likelihood of hiccups while shipping. If shipping is covered and you are willing to take the risk of international shipping, I will consider shipping internationally. Please also consider that because of additional PayPal fees for purchases from non-EU countries, the price of the set will increase according to the increase in PayPal fees. I am willing to cover a part of the increase, but not all of it.

Also, only purchase the set if you want it immediately. GMK Dots R2 is supposed to go into Groupbuy-Phase early next year.

Will reply to PMs tomorrow, going to sleep now.

Have a nice day!","[EU-DE] [H] GMK Dots, PayPal [W] Paypal, Olivia++ Light Base Set and Spacebars, RAMA Tessie cap for GMK Ursa"

To make it easier for buyers:

\- Shipping prices in eu generally are 4-15 euros (depends on various reasons (if it untracked or tracked), how big is the package)

\- Shipping prices to usa/canada generally are 20-70 (depends on various reasons, mostly size and weight affects price exponentially)

\- PRICE<60 € is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € for tracked;

\- 60=<PRICE<100 € is UNTRACKED unless +3.5 € for tracked;

\- PRICE=>100+ € items is sent via tracked/registered mail unless asked otherwise;

\* Buying zilent v2 in smaller quantities (20-43) is tad bit more expensive per switch than all 110 due to the same shipping price, packaging as 110. For example 40 switches would be 62 euros (shipping and pp fees included!). For more info pm me.

Please comment before PMing me and sending PM, without comment chats will be ignored.

NOTE: Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. To make it easier I simply include shipping and pp fees. EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually.

Leopold FC660M - ~~$110~~ $85 USD + Shipping

First off, this board is practically in new condition. I just purchased this to use it for class while I didn't have a keyboard, and afterwards put the dust cover back on it and let it sit in my closet for a little while. It has been dusted using my high pressure air compressor, and looks basically brand new. Original packaging and all included. Tthis particular FC660M contains Cherry MX Reds, with no modifications to the board whatsoever.

~~Nightfox - $150 $125 + Shipping~~

~~This particular Nightfox has Cherry MX Silent Black switches, lubed with Tribosys 3204, Dampening foam, Zeal stabs lubed with Keytox 205g0 for the shift, backspace, and enter, and a screw-in GMK stab for the spacebar lubed with Krytox 205g0, and band-aid modded. Very silent, very smooth, very bassy. This board has a slight issue with the R key, as it sometimes won't register a keypress, but pressing hard on the key seems to fix this problem for a long time. (Weeks.) So it's not a big issue at all, but I wanted to make sure you were aware. I think a simple desolder/resolder would make this switch work perfectly, but I'm blind so I can't solder/desolder out of concern for my safety.~~

DSA High Contrast Granite - ~~$120~~ $110 + Shipping

This is my favorite keycap set, and I'm so sad that it doesn't work with my new keyboard, but it's the full DSA High Contrast set. Absolutely love it, and I'm sure you will as well. Also willing to throw in the modifiers from the standard Granite set for an additional $30 USD. It's important to note that this also comes with an extra spacebar, and an extra set of icon modifiers. I was sent another set by signature plastics, and they had told me I could keep it. So I'm willing to pass those on to someone as well!

~~DZ65RGB Kit with Brass Plate, Everglide Stabilizers, Dampening Foam. - $150(?) $90 + Shipping~~

~~So the first thing you're probably asking is why is the price so much lower than MSRP? Well, to naswer that, this is aimed at people who are wanting to buy parts. These parts are scratched, and not in the best condition. I was planning on just posting the PCB and dampening foam here, but I didn't want to just throw away a perfectly usable plastic case/brass plate. So I'm including these as a bundle. If you truly wish to just purchase the PCB itself, them by all means, feel free to PM me and we can talk. This is the old DZ65RGB kit that came with the tada68 plastic case, and I chose to get a brass plate with it, and I also purchased some everglide stabilizers which have been clipped and lightly lubed, and it also comes with the official dampening foam for the PCB, and the USB-C cable. None of the original packaging. I would also be willing to part ways with this set of PBT Dye-Sub Cherry Profile caps that I got off of KBDFans, but you can also ask me more about those in PM.~~

Hi keeb warriors,

Hope everyone is having a nice chilly Autumn so far (chilly here in the Bay at least). Selling some stuff to make up for the 3070 I was able to purchase at my local computer store. **Not FCFS, will be prioritizing local sales near 94403 and if I have to ship it will be CONUS only.** Will list prices for both local and shipped for each item.

**Please leave a comment before shooting me a pm, and all chat messages will be ignored**

I'm also casually looking for a RAMA boxr artistan, either emperor or king. Will pay for a reasonable price.

Have a good rest of your day!

Retooled MX Black frankenswitch x84 | 16mm 62g springs, Tx films, Lubed 205g0, milky bottom. I desolder these from a board I bought from another member. Interesting frankenswitch. The 16mm springs are similar to Sprit slow springs where more force is required at the top. The milky bottom seems to reduce the sounds relative to the mx housing. Interesting linear switch that feels different from other linears due to the springs and milky housing.

Giant v3 Linear x98 | Brand new, stock. Special recolored JWK where the springs are extra long. The longer spring inside the housing will become essentially 'pre-loaded', reducing the difference between actuation and bottom out. Comes as 62g gold plated spring weights. | $65 shipped

Hi everyone,

I build, repair and fine tune keyboards. I’ve built and sold a list of keyboards already. You can check out my pass posts as reference. As you can see, I strive to create the best feel and sounding keyboard possible. I generally use the top-rated switches on my builds, but I do mix it up sometimes for more budget friendly builds. I also have many upcoming projects as well (CB87, IKKI68, Think65v2, Time 80, KBD Keyboards, and etc.) so stay tuned!

Hi all, still got a couple of cables left over from last week's sale so I'm reposting this for anyone who missed it.

These are all 1m cables, Carbon Knight cables are fitted with GX16 aviators.

//

After the last drop was so successful I wanted to bring some more budget cables to the market, however seeing as the overwhelming amount of requests were for the Carbon Knight cable I decided to focus solely on this colourway for this one.

A couple of changes since the last set are that I'm no longer using glue line heat shrink and instead using a hot glue gun to glue the inside of the metal USB housings together, this makes the actual USB end of the cable more ***a e s t h e t i c*** but keeps that extra strength on the inner wire. I've also changed the aviator connector from a GX12 to a GX16, I had some feedback and it seems like these are generally preferred and while I don't personally prefer them I can definitely see the appeal of having a larger connector on a thick cable as well as having the heatshrink poking out from underneath the aviator.

~~There is also one USB-mini cable that I made just in case anyone is running something like an older Alice board or a Tada68 and still wants to get in on this. SOLD~~

One of the aviator connectors came with a loose screw on the female side and because of this I've labelled it as b-stock and dropped the price by £5. Functionally it still works perfectly and it looks exactly the same, it's just that one side of the connector was wobbly when I received it so there's a bit of a discount there for someone that doesn't mind.

Lastly there's a couple of leftovers from the last drop which are the Mito Laser cable which pairs nicely with (at the risk of blowing your mind here) GMK/SA Laser with a purple techflex on blue paracord design and Moon Dust which is shimmer techflex on purple and black criss-cross paracord.

&#x200B;

This is from the Southpaw75 GB but via the Asia proxy so that means there are a few differences.

- PCB is black instead of green
- microcontroller is micro-usb instead of C (you can still add your own type-c micro controller if you want - I did)
- QMK profile is different
- NOT presoldered (I can solder for you one board if you want except for the microcontroller since it covers some switch pins)

[Photo Galley](https://imgur.com/a/uknGoaH)

Includes:
- top and bottom plate
- PCB x2 with resistors for 2 PCBs
- reset switches x2
- standoffs and screws
- bottom pads
- black standoffs (not originals)

I still have one and use it as a daily driver. I do recommend getting some taller bump ons for the rear to provide some typing angle. I use some rubber half circle shaped rubber seals. Can include the extra of that if you want. Then with GMK or similar profiles, the angle was pretty nice.

Hi,

I fell into the rabbit hole and bought way to many things over the past 2 years so I´m trying to sell a few things. Prices are either what I paid for the items or less.

This is a personal Engraved E-White Bahm Evelyn (Korean Alice Clone) . It is built with Hirose Orange switches that are filmed with Orange TX films , all lubed with Krytox 205G0 . I sourced them myself from Japan and they feel incredible to type on . The stabilizers are band-aid modified and lubed & I used a combo of red and black to match the style and the appearance of a Hirose switch . The wire is gold plated to match the brass reinforcement plate . LED's are sky-blue ,Pcb is Adelais Undergrow RGB programable by VIA or QMK .

Evelyn comes with an original brass plate used for the prototype (there are scratches on it ) , aluminum plate comes with a unique color combination and an extra fr4 matte black plate and an extra Adelais Arc-En-Ciel pcb.

Evelyn has heat treatment black lines on the polished brass weight but no noticeable scratches on it. There are scratches on the inside of the top and bottom housing where the screws go in , otherwise on the exterior there are no visible scratches.

This is the blog of the Evelyn maker Bahm , here you can find Evelyn and his other keyboards . He is quite popular in Korea : [Bahm's Naver Blog](https://m.blog.naver.com/PostList.nhn?blogId=hjg7808)

~~Asking:~~ **~~$325 shipped~~** **(sold)**

Premium 40% case from Panc. Bought it off of r/mm a few months back, decided that the layout is not for me and never got around to building it. It's brand new!

The second groupbuy run for this case is starting now and goes for $350, so you're getting it at a discount (and sooner!) if you pick this up.

Included:

* Case
* Powdercoated stainless steel plates (x2)
* USB C hotswap PCB w/ underglow
* USB Mini solderable PCB
* Plate foam (for in between plate and PCB)
* Acrylic midpiece-diffuser
* 2x GMK 2u Stabs (one set cut in prep for bandaid mod, but never followed through)
* White USB C cable

PM or chat me with any questions. Thanks!",[US-CA] [H] Unbuilt White Panc40 w/ HHKB blockers [W] Paypal

Hey, hope everyone is having a great day so far! I have a few things to sell that haven’t been getting much use. I would greatly prefer to not split the individual listings apart, since it’s a lot of work, but I’m willing to work with you. I will be shipping from Northern California, and shipping isn’t included with each item. I can ship out of the US if necessary.

Hi mechmarket, I have 3 things I would like to sell today,

As always, CONUS buyers only, please

**Note about the Mode Eighty:**

There will be another sale of the Mode Eighty First Edition on 11/17 and B-stock ones are in stock right now at their website.

As I've mentioned in my previous post, I am selling the Mode Eighty because it's too expensive for me. I'm not on the verge of bankruptcy, it's just that I think I've spent too much on keyboards now. I just want to sell the board at cost to me (paid a good amount of tax on this purchase).

**Note about the NK65:**

There will be a huge restock of NK65s soon (I forget when), for both the entry and aluminum editions. However, to my knowledge, the E-White option will not be restocked this time.

If you happen to be local to Orange County, I can give a little discount.

Local is preferred, especially for the keyboards.

|Item|Condition|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Mode Eighty First Edition - Light|BNIB|$725 + shipping|
|GMK Cafe Base + Spacebars (I really would like to sell this as a bundle)|BNIB|~~$375 shipped~~ SOLD|
|NK65 Aluminum E-White|Used for around 1.5 months (built on September 29th), more details below|~~$288 + shipping for everything excluding the keycaps (will throw in 2 extra stock Ink Blacks that were unused)~~ SOLD|

The NK65 has been built with (information copied from my old post):

* Gateron Ink Blacks (v2), lubed with Krytox 205g0 and filmed with Deskeys films
* Stabs have been clipped and lubed (205g0 for the housing and dielectric grease for the wire)
* ePBT ABS WoB keycaps (no shine as far as I can tell)

The only imperfection I could find is a small spot under the spacebar, which was not caused by me, and I have included a photo of it (in the old timestamp).

The carrying case (unused) and coiled cable (unused, it is a white-ish cable, not the black one) are included.

Please feel free to PM me if you have any questions and/or if you would like to buy more than 1 item, I'm generally a nice guy

Krytone Sheep - Bundle only, $420(heh) - Krytone's old Topre stem that fits on most MX stems as well. I'm super fond of these caps and I've been super hesitant to let this group collection go, but artisans don't pay the water bill.  

Krytone Chickeys - $32/ea - Some are Krytone's aforementioned Topre/MX stems, some are MX only, as labeled in the timestamps. Part of my overall Krytone-centric collection. 

Krytone D'mons - $32/ea - All MX only. More Krytone stuff I've been holding onto for years now, including one I stopped in the middle of a 4hr drive home from uni to nab. All 3 sold.

Hello Mechmarket.

I want to sell this beautiful keyboard for exactly the same as i paid for it brand new from Ungodly.designs. I was lucky to win the raffle but the layout isn't for me sadly.

I got 6 different gaskets for it that i will add for free, and both a solder and a Hotswap PCB that also is included free of charge.

The price takes into consideration : Danish import VAT (25%) + Import Fee (24 Euro) and paypal fees.

Should the price however still seem to high for you and you really want this keyboard, im willing to take a offer. I really need to free up some cash for christmas.

Thanks!

\* Buying zilent v2 in smaller quantities (20-43) is tad bit more expensive per switch than all 110 due to the same shipping price, packaging as 110. For example 40 switches would be 62 euros (shipping and pp fees included!). For more info pm me.

Please comment before PMing me and sending chat request, without comment chats will be ignored.

NOTE: Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive (due to overseas shipping) and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. To make it easier I simply include shipping and pp fees.

~~Spring~~ Winter cleaning is ongoing! Added another board to the list:

1.	~~Smith+Rune Iron165 Graphite A-Stock kit | [Iron165 Sound Check](https://youtu.be/X34LOG6frsg) | Tired of _FOMO_ during _IRONMANIA2020_? Didn’t get an Iron180 spot? Here, you can have its (arguably superior?) little brother, and you don’t have to wait half a year! Graphite anodized top, silver anodized bottom, bead-blasted brass weight. Brass has two minor patinas as pictured; anodizing is flawless. Comes with _sealed_ PCB, unused 6.25U brass plate, once-built 6.25U polycarbonate plate, black and silver badges, all fasteners, and TX-style carrying case. USB-C daughterboard and gaskets are already installed in the chassis. Asking for $2200 shipped.~~ **SOLD for asking**

2.	~~Percent Studio Canoe Gen2 Svart, 2 builds | This is probably the brightest per-key RGB board I’ve ever seen. There are two builds: (a) Everglide Sakuras (JTK linears) lubed on a brushed silver aluminum plate with lubed C3 stabilizers, and (b) Zealios V1 62g lubed on a purple anodized brushed aluminum plate with lubed Durock stabilizers. Colorway is black top/bottom with silver badge and LED accents, as well as an e-orange accent mid-layer. Half-gasket mount (bottom only), USB-C QMK/VIA compatible._Keycaps not included._~~ **REPOSTED**

3.	~~TX75v2 Dark Grey built w/OG Milky Top Tangerines (V1.5?) | [TX75v2 Sound Check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m1J8joqJvc) | Heavy-duty workhorse 75% board. Sandwich mount, brushed brass plate, but with the sound of these 3204-lubed OG tangies, you’d never know. Screw-in PCB-mount lubed GMK stabs, RGB sideglow, and a huge brass bottom weight. Case foam for some dampening. Heavy as heck at 3.1kg (same as the TX87v2!). Excellent condition with flawless anodizing. USB-C connector. Comes with two spare switches. Asking for $540 shipped.~~ **SOLD for $450+shipping**

4.	~~WASD V2 104-key Full-size | Originally a Cherry Brown board, now a lubed Cherry Red board with Gateron Yellow on the spacebar and a few Gateron Black on the F-row. This board makes a great beater, or a soldering/desoldering practice board: the PCB pads are almost impossible to overheat, and the PCB lifts away from the plate once all switch pins have been hit with a desoldering gun. Costar plate-mount stabs included. If you want cheap keycaps for this, I have some available to make a complete board. Asking for $55 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

| [Rose gold WKL Polaris, soldered](https://imgur.com/a/ykL4VL7) | One built, one un-built. Half polycarbonate plate with foam used, split backspace, split right shift, TX Filmed Tealios v2 with stock springs - 205g0 and 105, clipped cherry stabs with 205g0, electrical tape that can be removed used to cover up the flex cut. Disclaimer: I desoldered this once to changed from full backspace to split back space. Used a Hakko FR-301 for this, no damage to the pads. Unused full brass plate + unused pcb + unused foam. The back weight has some minor patina building on it. Comes with every accessory that was originally in the package. Not willing to split extras at this time. | $750 |
| [RAMA U80-A Milk](https://imgur.com/a/YZhqAtC) | Brand new RAMA U80 milk with hotswap pcb and internal weight. Opened to inspect, but never decided to ultimately use this. One small [nick](https://imgur.com/a/hboevCU)  on the inside of the case that came like that to me from RAMA which I tried to highlight in the pictures. | $1400 |
| ~~[Switch Couture Alice Frosted with frosted case feet](https://imgur.com/a/h1KACAn)~~  | ~~Built with 62g tangies lubed with 205g0 and 105 on stock springs. TX Filmed. Cherry stabs clipped and lubed with 205g0. Built and only used it for 2 hours since the layout was never really conductive to gaming for me.~~ | ~~$350~~ |
| ~~[Black and pink Key65 soldered](https://imgur.com/a/1oiA0nc)~~ | ~~Built with polycarb plate, H1 switches with 68g SPRIT complex springs, lubed with 205g0 and 105 on the springs. TX Filmed. NOTE: I burnt a pad trying to get split backspace to work on this pcb, although it doesn't affect the current layout with a full backspace. Comes with an extra unused pcb, foam padding, and pink aluminum plate.~~ | ~~$800~~ |

Hey everyone. I purchased quite a bit on mm and I am now looking to get rid of extra stuff that I am no longer using/need.

I am only looking to sell locally at the moment and have no plans on shipping any items.

Not FCFS - priority goes to those that are willing to come pick up the items (Kennedy & Danforth Rd). I can drive out to meet up at Kennedy commons(kennedy & hwy 401) or surrounding areas.

Prices will be in **CAD.** Items that are sold will be crossed off.

|[**SA Laser (Gaijin & Obnet Sets)**](https://drop.com/buy/drop-mito-sa-laser-custom-keycap-set)|[IMGUR Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/o3Cc1JC) Used as my daily driver for a month. There is moderate shine on the alphas and mods. No missing keys. There are no issues with mounting except for one or two ""loose"" keys. These keys mount fine; they just require a bit less force to remove. The 6.25u spacebar has slightly damaged MX mounts on the left and right side. This results in the spacebar lifting off the stabilizers when pressed too far to the sides. To fix this, you can apply a bit of teflon tape to the stabilizer mounts (which is what I did).

Hi all, looking to off load some stuff I no longer need or want.

Prices listed below, these prices are for CONUS only and I will most likely be using USPS priority, I have over 100 confirmed trades on HWS. 

Items for sale:

* **KBD8X MK II - Gray:** $430 + shipping - Unbuilt KBD8X MK II in gray. Comes with PCB, brass plate, screws/bump-ons and stupidfish1 foam that I bought. There are no blemishes on the keyboard/brass weight and every thing is in pristine condition. Only taken out for pictures and PCB was tested with tweezers to ensure functionality. Durock V1 stabs can also be added for $20 more. 

* ~~**KBD67V2 MK II - e-white:** $350 + shipping - Unbuilt KBD67V2 MK II in e-white. Comes with hot-swap PCB, brass plate, screws/bump-ons and case/plate foam. There are no blemishes on the keyboard/brass weight and every thing is in pristine condition. Only taken out for pictures and PCB was tested with tweezers to ensure functionality. Durock V1 stabs can also be added for $20 more.~~ SOLD

* **1x KBD67V2 Case + Plate Foam:** $15 + shipping - case and plate foam for the KBD67V2, this is extra, can add with purchase of KBD67V2 for $10 extra. 


* ~~**Practice65V2:** $135 + shipping. Bought this for use in the office and was cheap enough for giggles. After sourcing quite a few parts, I did some testing to see how quiet I could get it and settled on silent tactile switches. I also band-aid modded the PCB so the sound of the stabilizers would be more muted and added o-ring gaskets above and below the FR4 plate to try to isolate the sound even more. Board was not poorly soldered together, I do have some experience (~6 years) from working with electronics back in college and as a side hobby. Not looking to make a profit on this, tried to price fairly. [Here is a sound test for those that are interested.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoyFyY3_Trk) Keycaps are not included. Note that the plate/pcb can be used for the Stacked65 which is coming out soon if you'd want a nicer case. Price breakdown shown below:~~ SOLD

* Practice65V2 Component | Price
---|---
Practice65V2 Kit | $54 (price after shipping from CannonKeys)
67x Gazzew Boba U4 62g lubed w/ Krytox 203 & GPL 105 | $66
GMK stabs balanced/clipped/lubed w/ Krytox 205g0 & Dielectric Grease | $15
Extras: Rubber bumpons, o-ring gaskets, band-aid mod | $-
Total | $135

* **90x L/F Alpacas V1:** $105 + shipping - Alpacas lubed with Krytox 205g0 on housing, stem and legs, Krytox gpl 105 on springs and filmed with Deskey films. Switches are brand new par modifications (never been used/soldered).

* **89x L/F Gateron Milky Yellow:** $47 + shipping - lubed with Krytox 205g0 on housing, stem, legs, and springs and filmed with Deskey films. Switches were bought off here and were soldered previously by the first owner. They're cleanly desoldered and I have been using them in a hotswap keyboard since.

* **2x 70x Stock Polar Pandas:** $58 + shipping - these were purchased with the intent of making holy pandas, but I enjoy the holy bobas so decided not to go this route. Switches are stock and have never been used/soldered/modified in any way.

* **125x Stock C3 Tangerines 62g:** $105 + shipping - stock tangerines which have light factory lube on them. Preferred gateron ink blacks for the sound, but these are very smooth. Never used/soldered, tested one switch on hotswap keyboard. Comes with the container pictured. 

* **70x Stock NovelKey Cream Switches:** $50 + shipping - stock NovelKey cream switches I bought recently and have been using for some time. Have been trying to break them in, but don't have the patience to keep them in my board for 6 months. They've been used for 1 week in a hotswap keyboard.

Lost my job yesterday. Need some funds.  

First thing I've got is an E-White C3 Equalz One TKL WKL keyboard built with Healios lubed with GPL105, Zeal stabs on a PC plate. The person I bought this from got it during the groupbuy and built it. This has been my daily driver from the day it arrived, and it's butter to type on. There are a few things to note:   
1) there is stab rattle on the spacebar, but it's very light. I took the board apart to see if it was fixable, but it was a solder job and I didn't want to bother with desoldering the entire thing to fix a slight rattle that didn't really bother me.   
2) while taking it apart, I stripped one of the case screws. Has no effect on the board, just a screw that won't completely tighten. Doesn't rattle.   
3) when I took the board apart I noticed that the right side of the pcb + plate were closer together than the left side. I have no idea why this is, but I imagine that you would need to desolder the board to fix it. Has no effect of typing, feel or acoustics. Can't see it while the board is assembled either so I just left it.
4) there are a couple of very very minor dings on the underside of the board that are not noticeable unless you have your eye right up to the board. I didn't take pictures because they're basically imperceptible and I'm pricing the board to sell.   

This board has been very well and very often used on a very clean desk. Like I said, this thing types like butter. It's my first silent linear that I've typed on and it made me a convert. It's my favorite switch to this day.  

Bought the board for $375 + shipping, came out to around $400 total (without keycaps). Selling for $300 + ship. 

If you want SA Honeywell included, I can toss it in for an additional... $150? On top. I bought this set brand new from Originative for whatever obscene price it was. Has a lot of shine, but I frankly think that SA keycaps look better with shine. *EDIT: I forgot to mention that the bottom piece of this board is red, which is why I chose SA Honeywell as the set.


The SC Alice was built by me. The R1 Drop HPs came prelubed but I opened them all and cleaned off a lot of the over lubing that plagued the Drop Pandas. The stabs are clipped GMK +1 C3 2u stab because I didn't have enough GMK 2us, lubed with 205g0, absolutely no rattle. The build itself is full matte black, but I also have a clear bottom piece with additional clear hardware to match that will be included. I paid $250 for the unbuilt kit. Selling for $300 + ship w/o keycaps. Olivia is not for sale.  (SOLD)

Sorry for the walls of text, I wanted to be as thorough as possible. I will try my best to handle things on a FCFS basis, but I'm feeling like shit right now so... I'll do my best.",[US-VA][H] White/Red C3 Equalz One TKL WKL (Healios) & Matte Black Switch Couture Alice (R1 Drop Holy Pandas) [W] PayPal

Hey guys!

Selling off the first board that got me into this hobby last fall before all this craziness started...It's a black Tofu65 in Mint condition. No scuffs of any kind on the outside.

Specs:

* Black Tofu65 case with brass weight. Large scratch on the inside of the case, I received it like this so I assume it happened during production. Cannot be seen while the PCB/Plate is in the case
* KBD67 Rev2 Soldered PCB, I burnt a pad on one of the keys which can be seen in the timestamp. I bridged it with a wire and all keys work fine now.
* Tealios V2 switches lubed with 3204 and filmed with TX films
* Two pieces of [u/stupidfish1](https://www.reddit.com/u/stupidfish1/) case foam
* Brass Plate
* Lubed Durock Stabilizers with 205g0 and dielectric grease
* [Soundtest with GMK Keycaps](https://soundcloud.com/kyle-miller-776396183/tofu-65-gmk-teliosv2)
* 7u spacebar and split backspace layout, make sure you have a compatible keycap set to fit this layout.

I'm including the extra tealios switches that I didn't use in the build as well as the extra screws that came with the case. This thing is attractive/heavy/and buttery smooth. I hope that someone out there will enjoy it as much as I did.

Hello r/mechmarket, today for you I have a couple things I am hoping to sell to get some money back to put towards a future build, either keyboard or pc!

1. 60% keyboard build with lubed 62g koala switches. kbdfans brass plate, 1upkeyboards solder pcb, lubed durock clear stabilizers, low profile kbdfans acrylic case and case foam.  I also have keycaps to offer if interested just ask me!  ASKING 120 shipped
2. SOLD!!!!!!!! Carbon fiber 60% plate - bought off of a group buy on here, forgot it was coming in, never really used it except for a typing test on a hotswap build.  Plate just wasn't for me. ASKING 20 shipped
3. SOLD!!!!!!!! KBDFANS dz60 pcb - MOSTLY HOT SWAP, this pcb is mill max 7305 hot swap socket on all the switches except the bottom row and the escape key.  All sockets work perfectly and the pcb is to my best ability cleanly desoldered but i dont have a good desoldering gun. ASKING 40 shipped.
4. GMK Bento themed coiled aviator cable - I do have gmk bento coming in from the group buy still but I have 1 white and 1 pink aviator cable currently and I cant warrant having this cable sitting in my desk when it can be a beautiful addition to another persons setup! I paid 65 for it ASKING 45 shipped

~~Spring~~ Winter cleaning is upon us! Have a few great boards for you in this post:

1.	~~Cannonkeys Chimera65 Gray/Lilac | This is an A-stock, _flawless_ Chimera65 with gaskets and bumpons already installed in the chassis. PCB is still _sealed_, comes with brass plate, fr4 plate, and aftermarket aluminum half-plate made by u/PigeonsLikeBread. 2.5mm hex screwdriver and CK carrying case are included. Ships in original CK shipping box. Asking for $1635 shipped~~ **SOLD for 1600 bundled with the Volt-80**

2.	~~Cannonkeys Satisfaction75 Navy | You have probably heard of the Satisfaction75. This one is round 1, number 144 of 250. Navy blue anodized with white enamel color-filled Cannonkeys logo. This is _not_ a perfect specimen, please check the imgur album above for more details. Everything that needs to function, does function: cleanly desoldered PCB, OLED, encoder with gold standard knob. Comes with factory bead-blasted brass plate, aftermarket POM plate with universal compatibility (split L-shift and split spacebar), CK soft case, and authenticity card. Does not include keycaps, keyswitches, or a battery for the real-time clock. Ideal board for a daily driver! Asking for $1440 shipped.~~ **SOLD for asking**

3.	~~Excluisve (now Exclusive) E7V1 E-White | Exquisite exterior; I can’t find any flaws in the e-white coating at all. Brass weight is internal mount, polished and clearcoated. There are some superficial scratches in the clearcoat on the weight. Factory plate is matching polished & clearcoated brass, and an extra polycarbonate full plate is along for the ride. PCB is desoldered with FR-301 and in very good shape with no pad damage. You can tell that this was a transition period for Excluisve’s name because one side of the PCB says “Excluisve” and the other “Exclusive”. Friendly 75% layout with 9 RGB LEDs on top to drive the accent above the arrow cluster. Top mount, mini-USB, QMK/VIA compatible. Asking for $750 shipped.~~ **SOLD for asking**

4.	~~Percent Studio Canoe Gen2 Svart, 2 builds | This is probably the brightest per-key RGB board I’ve ever seen. There are two builds: (a) Everglide Sakuras (JTK linears) lubed on a brushed silver aluminum plate with lubed C3 stabilizers, and (b) Zealios V1 62g lubed on a purple anodized brushed aluminum plate with lubed Durock stabilizers. Colorway is black top/bottom with silver badge and LED accents, as well as an e-orange accent mid-layer. Half-gasket mount (bottom only), USB-C QMK/VIA compatible._Keycaps not included._~~ **REPOSTED**

5.	~~TX75v2 Dark Grey built w/OG Milky Top Tangerines (V1.5?) | [Sound Check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m1J8joqJvc) | Heavy-duty workhorse 75% board. Sandwich mount, brushed brass plate, but with the sound of these 3204-lubed OG tangies, you’d never know. Screw-in PCB-mount lubed GMK stabs, RGB sideglow, and a huge brass bottom weight. Case foam for some dampening. Heavy as heck at 3.1kg (same as the TX87v2!). Excellent condition with flawless anodizing. USB-C connector. Comes with two spare switches.~~ **REPOSTED**

6.	~~Percent Studio Volt-80 TKL | Winkeyless TKL with an extra two keys on the F-row. Cerakoted in Glacier Black because I wasn’t a fan of the original Mango, it’s a deep matte fingerprint magnet, but what a beautiful fingerprint magnet it is! Rear accent plate has been left E-white. PCB has Kailh hotswap sockets and per-key RGB along with a Matrix-like RGB accent above the arrow cluster. USB-C and Bluetooth capable, though you’d need to buy a battery (these did not ship with batteries). Integral plate and top case, dampening mat between plate and PCB already installed. Comes with lubed stabs, no switches, no keycaps, in original box. Asking for $630 shipped~~ **SOLD for $576 shipped bundled with Chimera65**

7.	~~WASD V2 104-key Full-size | Originally a Cherry Brown board, now a lubed Cherry Red board with Gateron Yellow on the spacebar and a few Gateron Black on the F-row. This board makes a great beater, or a soldering/desoldering practice board: the PCB pads are almost impossible to overheat, and the PCB lifts away from the plate once all switch pins have been hit with a desoldering gun. Costar plate-mount stabs included. If you want cheap keycaps for this, I have some available to make a complete board.~~ **REPOSTED**

Hello,

Today I have for sale my frosted eo87. I really don't want to be selling this, but I need to fund some future builds. I used my own frankenswitch which I think is really nice. It has a nice and thocky bottom out with a silent upstroke. Thought it wasn't going to be that good but was pleasantly surprised and I already have some for another build. (PS. I didn't have enough switches so look at pictures and specs to see what they are)

Comes with the case, cloth, and board.

[TIMESTAMP](https://imgur.com/a/xpTe0sJ)

I have a few boards I am unloading to make space for new ones. Pricing includes shipping in CONUS.

&#x200B;

**1.**  Black ID80 w/ lubed Turquoise Tealios (krytox 205g0) and stock Koalas. Has neoprene foam and an internal Brass weight

\- I bought this ID80 as my first board and to test a bunch of different switches. The board worked great and had no issues at all. I added some foam and a brass weight to get rid of the hollow sound, as well as make it a but heavier to make it feel more ""premium."" There is a small blemish on the front left of the board which can be seen in the timestamp. The board has a mixture of lubed turquoise tealios switches and stock koala switches. The price of the board includes all the swtiches; however, if you are not interested I can remove them and discount the price. I can include a sound test if youre interested as well. Price: $250 Shipped + OBO

Edit: If you buy the keyboard with switches I will include a set of Tai-Hao orange+white ABS  Keycaps for free.

**2. Green KBD Fans 5 degree case, with Lubed Milky Gateron Yellows (Krytox 205g0) and GMK Bento Clone**

This board is new and completely unused. I bought the parts to build this board for fun. The case is flawless and has no dings or dents. I also added some neoprene to the case in order to take out some of the hollow sound. I used a 62g tangerine switch on the spacebar, but can be swapped out to a milky gateron yellow upon request. This build comes with the original blockers to transform the style of the keyboard. Included on the board is a GMK Bento Clone that has been used for 1-2 weeks, but since it is PBT there is no shine. The quality of the keycaps are great and durable, and the printing of the text and novelties are sharp. Can provide additional photos if interested. Price: $300 Shipped + OBO

**3. Mt3 Serika (Latin Alphas, Mods, Arrows)**

I have a like-new set of MT3 Serika. I mounted them for a typing test and some photos and determined that I am not a fan of the profile. (Dont know if there will be a round 2 of these)

Price: $290 Shipped.

**4. 90x Kailh Box Red Swtiches - Price: $40 shipped**

Not Fcfs

Thanks for reading through. Let me know if you have any questions. Comment before Pm. Thanks!","[US-CA][H] ID80, Built KBD fans 5 degree w/ gateron yellows, GMK Bento Clones, MT3 Serika Kailh Box Red Switches [W] Paypal"

Hi mechmarket, I have a couple things I would like to sell today, not looking to trade this time because my keyboard expenditure has gotten out of control.

CONUS buyers only, please

Please note that there is a second sale of the Mode Eighty First Edition on 11/17, where 300 units will be offered (hotswap option available then). Also, there are currently B-stock units available at [Mode Design's website](https://shop.modedesigns.com/collections/first-edition-release/products/eighty-case-only?variant=32741173395538).

Anyhow, I'm selling the Mode Eighty because it was an impulse buy (did it in the bathroom at work) and it's simply too expensive for me to use personally (and I don't have a soldering iron). As such, I'm looking to sell it basically at cost to me (paid quite a lot over retail due to taxes mainly). I have not taken the keyboard out of the wrapping paper in fear of smudging its incredibly beautiful backside.

Local buyers strongly preferred, especially for the Mode Eighty, so if you happen to be located in/near Orange County and are willing to travel to somewhere close to me, that would be great and I can provide a little discount.

|Item|Condition|Price|

Hello, [r/mechmarket](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/) !

I hope everyone is doing well.

I saw how well Cyberboard turned out and wanted to get one for myself. Sadly, not willing to pay the $1000+ aftermarket price, so I was thinking of using my keycaps/artisans to offset the cost.

I am willing to pay a little over retail and add my GMK Olivia on top.

I am also looking for a triple-shot GAF Fvckboi artisans (Puddle Peon, etc). Trading for my Off Black and adding any cool artisans I can find, just send me a DM :)

TL;DR: No, FB is not for sale (and I've been offered $2500 for it), I won't trade for any other cap.

All Prices in USD, and do not contain shipping unless otherwise stated. I prefer shipping CONUS because of COVID but I'm willing to work with buyers understanding that it will be a premium. Thank you for taking the time to view my post. Stay safe, have a nice day. all of my items I'm willing to make trades on but the preference is stated as I have it written! worst I can say is no :)

**~~EO-87: $500 + Shipping OBO~~** ~~This is from the TX groupbuy. It has all the premium options the group buy allowed. Frosted base, Winkey, E-White, Brass plate and weight, Solder PCB. Side accent pieces, included cable, extra screws, custom bag for the keeb as well. (~~  Sold for asking to u/PreyTheBaee

**Monstargear NINJA87: $110 + Shipping OBO** This is a board I picked up when entered the hobby, I had plans for it but decided that someone else would appreciate it much more than myself and would be a good entry board for someone to have. This is a sandwich style acrylic board, hotswap, original stabs and have never been lubed. but I'm willing to throw in some GMK stabs if they are wanted. This is what Monstargear claims this is the 'clear' variant but as you can see its frosted.

Leopold FC660M - ~~$110~~ $85 USD + Shipping

First off, this board is practically in new condition. I just purchased this to use it for class while I didn't have a keyboard, and afterwards put the dust cover back on it and let it sit in my closet for a little while. It has been dusted using my high pressure air compressor, and looks basically brand new. Original packaging and all included. Tthis particular FC660M contains Cherry MX Reds, with no modifications to the board whatsoever.

Nightfox - ~~$150~~ $125 + Shipping

This particular Nightfox has Cherry MX Silent Black switches, lubed with Tribosys 3204, Dampening foam, Zeal stabs lubed with Keytox 205g0 for the shift, backspace, and enter, and a screw-in GMK stab for the spacebar lubed with Krytox 205g0, and band-aid modded. Very silent, very smooth, very bassy. This board has a slight issue with the R key, as it sometimes won't register a keypress, but pressing hard on the key seems to fix this problem for a long time. (Weeks.) So it's not a big issue at all, but I wanted to make sure you were aware. I think a simple desolder/resolder would make this switch work perfectly, but I'm blind so I can't solder/desolder out of concern for my safety.

DSA High Contrast Granite - ~~$120~~ $110 + Shipping

This is my favorite keycap set, and I'm so sad that it doesn't work with my new keyboard, but it's the full DSA High Contrast set. Absolutely love it, and I'm sure you will as well. Also willing to throw in the modifiers from the standard Granite set for an additional $30 USD. It's important to note that this also comes with an extra spacebar, and an extra set of icon modifiers. I was sent another set by signature plastics, and they had told me I could keep it. So I'm willing to pass those on to someone as well!

DZ65RGB Kit with Brass Plate, Everglide Stabilizers, Dampening Foam. - $~~150(?)~~ $90 + Shipping

So the first thing you're probably asking is why is the price so much lower than MSRP? Well, to naswer that, this is aimed at people who are wanting to buy parts. These parts are scratched, and not in the best condition. I was planning on just posting the PCB and dampening foam here, but I didn't want to just throw away a perfectly usable plastic case/brass plate. So I'm including these as a bundle. If you truly wish to just purchase the PCB itself, them by all means, feel free to PM me and we can talk. This is the old DZ65RGB kit that came with the tada68 plastic case, and I chose to get a brass plate with it, and I also purchased some everglide stabilizers which have been clipped and lightly lubed, and it also comes with the official dampening foam for the PCB, and the USB-C cable. None of the original packaging. I would also be willing to part ways with this set of PBT Dye-Sub Cherry Profile caps that I got off of KBDFans, but you can also ask me more about those in PM.

Post below and then PM please, I look forward to doing business with you!","[US-CA] [H] Nightfox 65%, Leopold FC660M 65%, DZ65RGB Kit 65%, DSA High Contrast Granite PBT Keycap Set, DSA Granite PBT Text Modifier set. [W] PayPal"
852,1605083582.0,/r/mechmarket/comments/js4ip6/euuk_h_grey_tx65_iso_sunny_pandelios_tx_bag_cable/," Hi MM -

**First:** [Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/5M2eSVF)

As promised another listing as part of raising funds. This is a hard one to part with, it's without doubt the best board I've owned. I've tried to show it as best as possible with the images, and also 2 sound tests - one by me today and one from when the board was built (by someone far more experienced than me).

**Spec:**

\- TX65 Grey, ISO  
\- Switches are Panda base, BSUN top, Zealio stem, SPRiT springs (68g), 72g on space and enter.  
\- Switches and stabilisers are lubed.  
\- GMK screw-in stabilisers with SPRiT gold-plated wires.  
\- Small strip of foam under the spacebar for mild dampening  
\- Orginal TX bag, TX microfibre, TX caps, spare screws  
\- Matching 3m USB to Mini-USB, and extra microfibre (good for covering when not in use).

**Condition:**

Generally excellent. Case has no visible flaws. The brass weight has one minor blemish that can only be seen in certain light, I've tried my best to capture this on the photos. Mileage is low, I've used it mostly for glamour shots but the switches are nicely bedded in and smooth.

**Feel:**

Switches were not cheap to put together but are a great combination, BSUN tops were used to be LED friendly. Nice thock in the sound and really tactile.

**Price and Shipping:**

Selling for cost of parts, I paid £600 in all (excluding build and shipping). Willing to pass it on for that.  
Will ship anywhere. but EU/UK preferred due to weight.

Hi all,

The last 9 hotswap KBD75v2 's I built for fun received so much interest I decided to build more on an ongoing basis! All proceeds will be put towards to my dream board HBCP :)

1. **$260USD / $340CAD** \- KBD75 V2 Hotswap build (gray case + hotswap PCB + Durock stabilizers lubed with krytox 205g0 + alu plate + platefoam + shelf liner dampening). **Does not come with switches/keycaps**. In new condition. If you **NEED** switches, I do have some stock gateron milky yellows or milky top blacks that I could add for $25USD/33CAD

&#x200B;

Also would be interested in trading for Infinikey Graen / GMK Olive with PayPal on sides to even things out.

Thanks for reading!","[CA-BC] [H] Hotswap KBD75V2 builds [W] PayPal, EMT, PBT Graen, GMK Olive"

This is a personal Engraved E-White Bahm Evelyn (Korean Alice Clone) . It is built with Hirose Orange switches that are filmed with Orange TX films , all lubed with Krytox 205G0 . I sourced them myself from Japan and they feel incredible to type on . The stabilizers are band-aid modified and lubed & I used a combo of red and black to match the style and the appearance of a Hirose switch . The wire is gold plated to match the brass reinforcement plate . LED's are sky-blue ,Pcb is Adelais Undergrow RGB programable by VIA or QMK .

Evelyn comes with an original brass plate used for the prototype (there are scratches on it ) , aluminum plate comes with a unique color combination and an extra fr4 matte black plate and an extra Adelais Arc-En-Ciel pcb.

Evelyn has heat treatment black lines on the polished brass weight but no noticeable scratches on it. There are scratches on the inside of the top and bottom housing where the screws go in , otherwise on the exterior there are no visible scratches.

This is the blog of the Evelyn maker Bahm , here you can find Evelyn and his other keyboards . He is quite popular in Korea : [Bahm's Naver Blog](https://m.blog.naver.com/PostList.nhn?blogId=hjg7808)

865,1605062545.0,/r/mechmarket/comments/jrznuv/kr_h_otd_gmk_rare_keycaps_w_paypal_bank_transfer/,"Most of the items for sale are rarely sold publicly or at all, so it's hard to price them especially in the crazy market nowadays. 

&nbsp;

Which leaves the buyer and seller to decide their value most of the time. I've priced most items pretty conservatively based on past private sales and sales of similar items. As such, I'm pretty flexible and open to offers if you think the pricing is unfair, or can show me a recent sale they've been sold for less in.

For bank transfer, we can do an international transfer, or I have a Morgan Chase account if you're in the U.S.

[~~OTD 356N MK2 Red~~](https://imgur.com/a/Mt4kVlX) | $4188 | $4000 | One of 10 units that were made in the red colorway. Not much explaining to do if you know what this is. There is a minor chink on the top case, and ano flaws on the bottom case (not visible when in use). Comes with 2 sets of internals (new pcb, new red alu plate + desoldered pcb, polycarb half plate)
[~~HeoK Dolch~~](https://imgur.com/a/G0a0mqh) | $838 | $800 | Built like a tank, weighing in at close to 6kg (13 pounds). Was a small Korea only group buy. FR4 plate, hard anodized. One of my best built boards and has been my daily for almost 2 years now. This board was built over the span of 3 months to make it absolutely perfect, as I built this to be my daily from the start. Was built by the best, and lubed by the best. Only the best switches and lube were used. 55g early batch cherry picked retooled blacks, lubed with 3 layers of RO59 (dry for hours after applying 1 layer, then apply the next layer; repeat) (ro59 is currently discontinued). Added to the thin lube, the switches have been naturally well worn in over the course of ~2years making them one of the smoothest switches you will ever experience. I would not recommend this board if you like thick lube on switches, which seems to be the trend nowadays. 
[~~OG Dolch + RGB Mods~~](https://imgur.com/a/G0a0mqh) | $126 | $120 | Was my daily set on the HeoK Dolch TKL. $30 discount if bought together with the HeoK Dolch.

[~~OTD Wrist Rest~~](https://imgur.com/a/SS3dADd) | $366 | $350 | New, hasn't even been oiled yet
[~~OTD 356mini v1 PCB&Plate~~](https://imgur.com/a/udllFXm) | $440 | $420 | Fully functional. Has been desoldered once, with minor damage to the PCB. No extras have been made for v1 internals, so someone out there with a 356mini v1 is missing the og internals. These are most likely the only ones you'll ever see for sale.

I included a picture of what the Frosted Alice keeb looks like with the keycaps, but I will not be selling it like that. The keycaps will be sold/sent in the bags they're in, and the keyboard will come without the keycaps mounted.

Hello, today I have a keyboard for sale. It is a well made and beautiful board that has been my daily driver for nearly 8 months, but due to changes in my job and living conditions post covid, I've downgraded my setup, and I can't justify keeping this board.

* Maple wood, hand cut dovetails, hardwax oil finish. Perfect condition.
* Maartenwut 1800 PCB
* Lubed and Filmed Holy Pandas
* Lubed Stabilizers
* Built by and purchased from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/fj1r5j/euse_hhandcrafted_wooden_1800_w_paypal/).
* $600 shipped CONUS

I am also interested in a GMK Burgundy set; I'll prioritize trade offers of the keycap set + PP.

Hi guys, back again with some more 1m budget cables.

After the last drop was so successful I wanted to bring some more budget cables to the market, however seeing as the overwhelming amount of requests were for the Carbon Knight cable I decided to focus solely on this colourway for this one.

A couple of changes since the last set are that I'm no longer using glue line heat shrink and instead using a hot glue gun to glue the inside of the metal USB housings together, this makes the actual USB end of the cable more ***a e s t h e t i c*** but keeps that extra strength on the inner wire. I've also changed the aviator connector from a GX12 to a GX16, I had some feedback and it seems like these are generally preferred and while I don't personally prefer them I can definitely see the appeal of having a larger connector on a thick cable as well as having the heatshrink poking out from underneath the aviator.

There is also one USB-mini cable that I made just in case anyone is running something like an older Alice board or a Tada68 and still wants to get in on this.

One of the aviator connectors came with a loose screw on the female side and because of this I've labelled it as b-stock and dropped the price by £5. Functionally it still works perfectly and it looks exactly the same, it's just that one side of the connector was wobbly when I received it so there's a bit of a discount there for someone that doesn't mind.

Lastly there's a couple of leftovers from the last drop which are the Mito Laser cable which pairs nicely with (at the risk of blowing your mind here) GMK/SA Laser with a purple techflex on blue paracord design and Moon Dust which is shimmer techflex on purple and black criss-cross paracord.

Hey guys!

Selling off the first board that got me into this hobby last fall before all this craziness started...It's a black Tofu65 in Mint condition. No scuffs of any kind on the outside.

Specs:

* Black Tofu65 case with brass weight. Large scratch on the inside of the case, I received it like this so I assume it happened during production. Cannot be seen while the PCB/Plate is in the case
* KBD67 Rev2 Soldered PCB, I burnt a pad on one of the keys which can be seen in the timestamp. I bridged it with a wire and all keys work fine now.
* Tealios V2 switches lubed with 3204 and filmed with TX films
* Two pieces of [u/stupidfish1](https://www.reddit.com/u/stupidfish1/) case foam
* Brass Plate
* Lubed Durock Stabilizers with 205g0 and dielectric grease
* [Soundtest with GMK Keycaps](https://soundcloud.com/kyle-miller-776396183/tofu-65-gmk-teliosv2)
* 7u spacebar and split backspace layout, make sure you have a compatible keycap set to fit this layout.

I'm including the extra tealios switches that I didn't use in the build as well as the extra screws that came with the case. This thing is attractive/heavy/and buttery smooth. I hope that someone out there will enjoy it as much as I did.

Hello all I am just cleaning out some stuff. If you need more photos or have more questions please just let me know. Thanks.

Massdrop ALT- $140- the keyboard would come with the barebones kit + stock keycaps. This would include the switch and keycap puller and stock cable. For an extra $15 I’ll Include 67 Halo true switches to go with it.

Mito DSA Legacy Novelties- $50- used for a few days and put right in the bag. Didn’t like DSA keycaps.

GMK Laser Novelties- $100- bought these off of someone else from mechmarket and never actually used. 

GMK Laser Spacebars-$50 these come with most of the Spacebars but not all. I can send more photos to show which they come with and which aren’t included. 

If you buy both the Novelties and the Spacebars I’ll throw in the extra laser keycaps show in the photos.

Hi!

I've got these two wonderful discipline keyboards to sell or trade. [Album](https://imgur.com/a/pV4KSfd)

&#x200B;

|Keyboard|Info|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|
| Fully Build Discipline |Built with Gat Yellows with Invyr stems lubed with 205G0.        GMK stabs lubed with 205G0 and Dielectric grease.|£200 ONO.|
| Discipline kit |All the components are soldered on except switches! Comes with a laser-cut case.|£150 ONO.|

Prices include shipping within the UK but EU and the US need to pay extra. 

The cases are a little different from what is recommended on Discipline Github its mostly made out of 3mm acrylic for the top, spacer and the bottom parts and the plate is 5mm (stab holes have been widened to accommodate).

If there is a request for a typing test for the fully build board, I'm happy to produce one, the sound quality won't be amazing (it will be from my phone), but I can say this board does sound pretty good.

Willing to trade for high-end keycaps such as GMK, Infinikey etc, open to anything just send me a PM of the set and I'll see if I like it, also I would heavily discount if you have Amidst the Cloud artisans (especially the black and white ones). 

Any questions, just PM me :)

Selling new unbuild KBD67MKII PC kit. I bought a few months back, but had to travel abroad and never built it. My GB keybs are coming in so don't see a need for it right now.

I'd also be willing to trade for GMK Analog Dreams with novelties but I know that's a stretch. 

Not FCFS for now, would prefer local (East Bay/Bay Area).

Hey gang, Im selling my stuff for a cool car. One hobby to another. I would highly prefer to sell the boards with the keycaps but can work with best offers. The deskmats are quite used, and I kind of want to keep them, but they're up for bid. 

Don't be afraid to pm about individual items

The 60% is a hotswap GK61 PCB (can be bluetooth if you get a batter that is compatible. I think I have one I can send with it). Lubed zeal stabs. Lubed and Filmed 78g Zilent v2 on board. I'll send you whatever Zilents I have in the bag too with no extra cost. 

The numpad is a kbd rose gold numpad with lubed Holy Pandas. Not sure the origin, I bought this from someone. Durok stabs btw

Overall, I have barely put my fingers on the keycaps. 

For the whole entire shooting match, I feel like $550 is reasonable since it is saving my convenience. The numpad alone was $200 and I've seen Olivia going for $300ish.

PM me with offers or questions.

Leopold FC660M - ~~$110~~ $85 USD + Shipping

First off, this board is practically in new condition. I just purchased this to use it for class while I didn't have a keyboard, and afterwards put the dust cover back on it and let it sit in my closet for a little while. It has been dusted using my high pressure air compressor, and looks basically brand new. Original packaging and all included. Tthis particular FC660M contains Cherry MX Reds, with no modifications to the board whatsoever.

Nightfox - ~~$150~~ $125 + Shipping

This particular Nightfox has Cherry MX Silent Black switches, lubed with Tribosys 3204, Dampening foam, Zeal stabs lubed with Keytox 205g0 for the shift, backspace, and enter, and a screw-in GMK stab for the spacebar lubed with Krytox 205g0, and band-aid modded. Very silent, very smooth, very bassy. This board has a slight issue with the R key, as it sometimes won't register a keypress, but pressing hard on the key seems to fix this problem for a long time. (Weeks.) So it's not a big issue at all, but I wanted to make sure you were aware. I think a simple desolder/resolder would make this switch work perfectly, but I'm blind so I can't solder/desolder out of concern for my safety.

DSA High Contrast Granite - ~~$120~~ $110 + Shipping

This is my favorite keycap set, and I'm so sad that it doesn't work with my new keyboard, but it's the full DSA High Contrast set. Absolutely love it, and I'm sure you will as well. Also willing to throw in the modifiers from the standard Granite set for an additional $30 USD. It's important to note that this also comes with an extra spacebar, and an extra set of icon modifiers. I was sent another set by signature plastics, and they had told me I could keep it. So I'm willing to pass those on to someone as well!

DZ65RGB Kit with Brass Plate, Everglide Stabilizers, Dampening Foam. - $~~150(?)~~ $90 + Shipping

So the first thing you're probably asking is why is the price so much lower than MSRP? Well, to naswer that, this is aimed at people who are wanting to buy parts. These parts are scratched, and not in the best condition. I was planning on just posting the PCB and dampening foam here, but I didn't want to just throw away a perfectly usable plastic case/brass plate. So I'm including these as a bundle. If you truly wish to just purchase the PCB itself, them by all means, feel free to PM me and we can talk. This is the old DZ65RGB kit that came with the tada68 plastic case, and I chose to get a brass plate with it, and I also purchased some everglide stabilizers which have been clipped and lightly lubed, and it also comes with the official dampening foam for the PCB, and the USB-C cable. None of the original packaging. I would also be willing to part ways with this set of PBT Dye-Sub Cherry Profile caps that I got off of KBDFans, but you can also ask me more about those in PM.

Post below and then PM please, I look forward to doing business with you!","[US-CA] [H] Nightfox 65%, Leopold FC660M 65%, DZ65RGB Kit 65%, DSA High Contrast Granite PBT Keycap Set, DSA Granite PBT Text Modifier set. [W] PayPal"

Hello you beautiful sexy people!

StayWired cables from Ontario, Canada here with our first batch of artisan cables!  

As excited as we are, we'll try to keep this post concise.

All our cables are oven baked and reversed coiled for that tight springy goodness that will last a long time. We also do custom orders at the same price as listed cables with 48hour lead time until it's shipped out! We'd love to make some more unique cables.

This is obviously our opinion but we'd like to point out [cable orientation](https://imgur.com/a/7jZLWQD) to people who don't know that they specifically prefer their cable setup a different way.

There are some extra caps (**there's a photo in the album**), but I didn't receive the whole set when I bought it from the previous owner. Will come with a **6ft Mini USB cable**, also from previous owner. **Extra caps are likely not enough to cover anything but this board or smaller.**

I installed **blue O-rings**, I will leave them on, so the buyer can remove or keep them as they please.

This board is in almost the same condition as when I got it, as I did not use it that much. The previous owner built it from a metal sandwich case and added their own wood piece in between. It has some hidden hairline cracks, but is in good condition otherwise. I can dig up old photos from the previous owner if you'd like.

I will also include the files for my layout and instructions on how to re-flash from previous owner.

Let me know if you have any other questions. Comment before PM please.

~~Spring~~ Winter cleaning is upon us! Have a few great boards for you in this post:

1.  **Cannonkeys Satisfaction75 Navy** | You have probably heard of the Satisfaction75. This one is round 1, number 144 of 250. Navy blue anodized with white enamel color-filled Cannonkeys logo. This is _not_ a perfect specimen, please check the imgur album above for more details. Everything that needs to function, does function: cleanly desoldered PCB, OLED, encoder with gold standard knob. Comes with factory bead-blasted brass plate, aftermarket POM plate with universal compatibility (split L-shift and split spacebar), CK soft case, and authenticity card. Does not include keycaps, keyswitches, or a battery for the real-time clock. Ideal board for a daily driver! **REPOSTED**

2. **TX75v2 Dark Grey built w/OG Milky Top Tangerines (V1.5?)** | [Sound Check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m1J8joqJvc) | Heavy-duty workhorse 75% board. Sandwich mount, brushed brass plate, but with the sound of these 3204-lubed OG tangies, you'd never know. Screw-in PCB-mount lubed GMK stabs, RGB sideglow, and a huge brass bottom weight. Case foam for some dampening. Heavy as heck at 3.1kg (same as the TX87v2!). Excellent condition with flawless anodizing. USB-C connector. Comes with two spare switches. **REPOSTED**

3. **Percent Studio Volt-80 TKL** | Winkeyless TKL with an extra two keys on the F-row. Cerakoted in Glacier Black because I wasn't a fan of the original Mango, it's a deep matte fingerprint magnet, but what a beautiful fingerprint magnet it is! Rear accent plate has been left E-white. PCB has Kailh hotswap sockets and per-key RGB along with a Matrix-like RGB accent above the arrow cluster. USB-C and Bluetooth capable, though you'd need to buy a battery (these did not ship with batteries). Integral plate and top case, dampening mat between plate and PCB already installed. Comes with lubed stabs, no switches, no keycaps, in original box. **REPOSTED**

4. **WASD V2 104-key Full-size** | Originally a Cherry Brown board, now a lubed Cherry Red board with Gateron Yellow on the spacebar and a few Gateron Black on the F-row. This board makes a great beater, or a soldering/desoldering practice board: the PCB pads are almost impossible to overheat, and the PCB lifts away from the plate once all switch pins have been hit with a desoldering gun. Costar plate-mount stabs included. If you want cheap keycaps for this, I have some available to make a complete board. **REPOSTED**

To make it easier for buyers:

\- Shipping prices in eu generally are 4-15 euros (depends on various reasons (if it untracked or tracked), how big is the package)

Please comment before PMing me and sending chat request, without comment chats will be ignored.

NOTE: Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive (due to overseas shipping) and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. To make it easier I simply include shipping and pp fees.

• TX-60 HHKB in Grey - € 460 + shipping

board is built in the picture but would be desoldered before shipping. but the board could be built up with h1 or mauves lubed and filmed if you want for an extra €70

The board has a small scratch on the rounded front on the right side and the smallest anode blemish just above that refer to last picture in the timestamp album. and there are some mini scratches on the clear coat on the brass weight but nothing a light polish can't get rid of. I'm selling it because it never gets included in the cycle of board (can't get used to the hhkb Ctrl).

Hey everyone. I am fairly new to the mechanical keyboard scene. I purchased quite a bit on mm and I am now looking to get rid of extra stuff that I am no longer using/need.

I am only looking to sell locally at the moment and have no plans on shipping any items.

Not FCFS - priority goes to those that are willing to come pick up the items (Kennedy & Danforth Rd). I can drive out to meet up at Kennedy commons(kennedy & hwy 401) or surrounding areas.

Prices will be in **CAD.** Items that are sold will be crossed off.

&#x200B;

|GMK Peaches n Cream|Purchased from another MM user. Used on my secondary keyboard for about a month. No shine. There's a pic to show all the caps are there.|$350 CAD|
|90x Giant V3|Lubed bottom, stem, stem legs and top/bottom spring with 205g0. Mounted only a few of them on a hotswap to test the sound and decided to stay with the alpacas.|$100 CAD|
|84x Tealios V2|Bought these off another user on MM and tested in a hotswap as well and decided not to use them. Housing and stems lubed with 3204. Spring swapped to 60g tx springs lubed with victorinox. Stem switched to UHMWPE linear stems|$110 CAD|

Looking to let go of this bad boy (Drop Alt Black High Profile, Kailh Burgundy Stems in T1 housing - 67g). Been using it for a few months now. It's an amazing board, but I've got a KBD67 MKII so really looking to give this board a new home. Looking to simply sell it and recoup some of the cost. I bought it used from another [r/mm](https://www.reddit.com/r/mm/) user and I've kept it in a like-new state without any flaws. I've also put a ton of work into modding it and the switches to get that deep thocc sound. It's a linear version with a Holy Panda-like sound.

Build:

* Drop Alt HP Black
* Frankenswitch = Kailh Burgundy in T1 Housing
* Stupidfish1 Foam
* Cherry Stabs, clipped and lubed.

1035,1604756051.0,/r/mechmarket/comments/jpqwnr/euuk_h_tx65_grey_iso_sunny_pandelios_tx_bag_w/,"Hi MM - 

**First:** [Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/5M2eSVF)

As promised another listing as part of raising funds. This is a hard one to part with, it's without doubt the best board I've owned. I've tried to show it as best as possible with the images, and also 2 sound tests - one by me today and one from when the board was built (by someone far more experienced than me). 

**Spec:**

\- TX65 Grey, ISO  
\- Switches are Panda base, BSUN top, Zealio stem, SPRiT springs (68g), 72g on space and enter.  
\- Switches and stabilisers are lubed.  
\- GMK screw-in stabilisers with SPRiT gold-plated wires.  
\- Small strip of foam under the spacebar for mild dampening  
\- Orginal TX bag, TX microfibre, TX caps, spare screws  
\- Matching 3m USB to Mini-USB, and extra microfibre (good for covering when not in use).

**Condition:**

Generally excellent, brass plate has a few visible manufacturing blemishes but invisible with keys on. Case has no visible flaws. The brass weight has one minor blemish that can only be seen in certain light, I've tried my best to capture this on the photos. Mileage is low, I've used it mostly for glamour shots but the switches are nicely bedded in and smooth.

**Feel:**

Switches were not cheap to put together but are a great combination, BSUN tops were used to be LED friendly. Nice thock in the sound and really tactile.

**Price and Shipping:**

Not looking to profit, I paid £600 in all (excluding build and shipping). Willing to pass it on for that.  
Will ship anywhere but EU/UK preferred due to weight.

Hey guys!

Selling off the first board that got me into this hobby last fall before all this craziness started...It's a black Tofu65 in Mint condition. No scuffs of any kind on the outside.

Specs:

* Black Tofu65 case with brass weight. Large scratch on the inside of the case, I received it like this so I assume it happened during production. Cannot be seen while the PCB/Plate is in the case
* KBD67 Rev2 Soldered PCB, I burnt a pad on one of the keys which can be seen in the timestamp. I bridged it with a wire and all keys work fine now.
* Tealios V2 switches lubed with 3204 and filmed with TX films
* Two pieces of u/stupidfish1 case foam
* Brass Plate
* Lubed Durock Stabilizers with 205g0 and dielectric grease
* [Soundtest with GMK Keycaps](https://soundcloud.com/kyle-miller-776396183/tofu-65-gmk-teliosv2)
* 7u spacebar and split backspace layout, make sure you have a compatible keycap set to fit this layout.

I'm including the extra tealios switches that I didn't use in the build as well as the extra screws that came with the case. This thing is attractive/heavy/and buttery smooth. I hope that someone out there will enjoy it as much as I did.

There are some extra caps (**there's a photo in the album**), but I didn't receive the whole set when I bought it from the previous owner. Will come with a **6ft Mini USB cable**, also from previous owner. **Extra caps are likely not enough to cover anything but this board or smaller.**

I installed **blue O-rings**, I will leave them on, so the buyer can remove or keep them as they please.

This board is in almost the same condition as when I got it, as I did not use it that much. The previous owner built it from a metal sandwich case and added their own wood piece in between. It has some hidden hairline cracks, but is in good condition otherwise. I can dig up old photos from the previous owner if you'd like.

I will also include the files for my layout and instructions on how to re-flash from previous owner.

Hi all,

The last 7 hotswap KBD75v2 's I built for fun received so much interest I decided to build more on an ongoing basis! All proceeds will be put towards to my dream board HBCP :)

1. **$260USD / $340CAD** \- KBD75 V2 Hotswap build (gray case + hotswap PCB + Durock stabilizers lubed with krytox 205g0 + alu plate + platefoam + shelf liner dampening). **Does not come with switches/keycaps**. In new condition. If you **NEED** switches, I do have some stock gateron milky yellows or milky top blacks that I could add for $22USD/28CAD
2. **$290USD / $380CAD** \- ~~KBD75 V2 Hotswap build (gray case + hotswap PCB + Durock stabilizers lubed with krytox 205g0 + **Brass plate** \+ platefoam + shelf liner dampening). **Does not come with switches/keycaps**.

Looking to let go of this bad boy (Drop Alt Black High Profile, Kailh Burgundy Stems in T1 housing - 67g). Been using it for a few months now. It's an amazing board, but I've got a KBD67 MKII so really looking to give this board a new home. Looking to simply sell it and recoup some of the cost. I bought it used from another r/mm user and I've kept it in a like-new state without any flaws. I've also put a ton of work into modding it and the switches to get that deep thocc sound. It's a linear version with a Holy Panda-like sound.

Comes with brand new PCB. Built with L+F Alpacas. The current PCB has a non-functioning altgr key, probably needs a bridge or something. Does not come with original column keys, you will have to use your own, as I have done in the pics. **Trades for boards, Keysets, etc**.

I purchased this keyboard around August this year and never used it ever since because I didn't really like the layout. I have switched out the cherry clip in stabilizers to GMK screw-in stabilizers. The GMK stabilizers are clipped and lubed with kryptox 205g0 in the housing and dielectric grease on the wires. The keyboard will also come with a screwdriver for the screws and the box it came in;  I have also added Sorbothane and box liner to help dampen the sound.

**Info**

Just getting rid of some items I have excess of and looking for a good home!

Items are not FCFS, are OBO (below asking), and shipping included to CONUS. Bundles are convenient and happy to negotiate a reasonable bundle price. It's also generally helpful if messages are clear and actionable (provide ZIP and PayPal in the initial message so I can quote shipping quickly). Unless they are marked as sold, they are still available.

CONUS shipping only because shipping internationally is not easy, especially with the pandemic.

Discord: flatwhite#0009

Reddit: PM only, I will not respond to any chats. Comment before PM'ing please.

I'm going to bed soon, will answer messages in the morning if I don't get to it tonight.

Hello!

Got a few items that I am hoping to move on to new and more appreciative homes! Listed below:

* **PC KBD67 with Hotswap PCB**
Bought this recently from another user here on MM and have since realized it's easier for me to carry my favorite keyboard with me back and forth from work than it is to have different boards at both work and home, so I am hoping to move this one on to someone else! Includes the PC case, PCB, screw-in stabs (lubed/clipped/band-aid modded), brass plate, and any additional hardware. Basically, you'll only need switches and keycaps in order to make this a full functioning keyboard. Only the brass plate shows some wear (hotswapping switches), but the build is otherwise flawless. *Asking $350+shipping, which is what I have in it*

* **Acyrlic Tofu60**
This is a solder build. dz60 PCB w/ lubed zealios v2 67g switches on a carbon fiber plate. This 60% layout features arrow keys. Moving on from this build as I prefer the 65% layout. *Asking $200 shipped for this board*

* **GMK Dualshot**
I have somehow managed to keep this one sealed so far, and I'm trying to sell before the urge to open it becomes too great. Full base kit still in the plastic. *Asking $300+shipping for this*

All prices are OBO! Let me know if you have questions about anything. Thanks for looking!","[US-KY][H] PC KBD67 hotswap, Acrylic Tofu60, GMK Dualshot [W] PayPal, Local Cash"

Items listed together are a bundled and won't be seperated. Laser Alt is used in like new condition with no scratches/other marks. Black Alt used and previously Plasti-dipped white by previous owner. This left no lasting marks, but there is still left over Plasti-dip on the inside of the case and in the switch slots of the plate, none of this is visible when assembled and in normal use and could be removed with a little effort, I priced accordingly to reflect this. You should be okay with finding a cat hair or 2. Boards come with original packaging minus usb cables. If it's not listed in the posting, it's not for sale. Post before Pm.

I installed **blue O-rings**, I will leave them on, so the buyer can remove or keep them as they please.

This board is in almost the same condition as when I got it, as I did not use it that much. The previous owner built it from a metal sandwich case and added their own wood piece in between. It has some hidden hairline cracks, but is in good condition otherwise. I can dig up old photos from the previous owner if you'd like.

I will also include the files for my layout and instructions on how to re-flash from previous owner.

* ~~E-White Tofu60 B-Stock Case - I bought this B-stock case not too long ago from KBDfans. I didn't see any cosmetic damage on the outside but there may be some internally (I'll double check but they shouldn't be visible when built). I have a piece of neoprene inside of the case to reduce any pinging noise from the aluminum.~~ **~~PRICE $75~~** ***SOLD***
* ~~Brass Plate - Purchased directly from KBDfans and I see no visible markings on it. Has a 2.25u left shift.~~ **~~PRICE $45~~** ***SOLD***
* ~~Instant60 Tsangan Hot-Swap PCB - Bought from Cannonkeys about 2 months ago. It has hot-swap, warm per-key lighting, RGB underglow, VIA compatibility, split backspace, and split right shift. The stabs are Durock screw-ins that are lubed with Krytox 205g0 and there are KBDfans foam stabilizer stickers. I have a white 2M GMK 7u spacebar that I'm willing to throw in for an extra $5 if needed.~~ **~~PRICE $65~~** ***SOLD***
* ~~70x 65g Lubed/Filmed NK Creams - These were springswapped to 65g Tx springs, filmed with Deskeys Films, and Lubed with Krytox 205g0 on the stem and housing and 105 on the springs. Most of them have been swapped around in the board a few times but some may be more broken in than others. There should be like 2 or 3 extra so the real total is about 72x/73x switches.~~ **~~PRICE $65~~** ***SOLD***

Prices are open to negotiation but I'd prefer to sell everything as a bundle for **PRICE** **$230**. SHIPPING IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE PRICES BUT IT CAN BE NEGOTIATED. Additional pictures and information can be provided upon request. If prices may seen unfair then let me know and they'll be adjusted.

Hey guys,

selling my black on black Realforce 88UB that I bought last year from [keyboardco.com](https://keyboardco.com/). I recently got a Novatouch and I prefer having the variety in keycaps I can use on topre.

The Realforce is lubed with 3203 on the sliders and 205 for the stabs. The enter key has a small dent that is only really visible from certain angles in certain lighting. The yellow wasd cluster will be included. I can also add a bag of kbdfans mx sliders free of charge.

Price: Really just looking to get back what I paid for it which was **250€ + shipping** (if you are from Germany I will pay for shipping)

Shipping rates:

• I’ll have to use an expensive expedited service, since the cheaper national carrier has been [rekt by Covid.](https://pos.com.my/journal/sed-ut-perspiciatis-unde-omnis-iste-natus-error-sit-voluptatem-accusantium-doloremque-4.html)

• For reference, shipping to CONUS would cost $55.

• Shipping price is the same ($55) for 1 or 2 sets due to the combined weight being below the minimum threshold, so please buy more than 1 item ;)

• PM me if you need a quote to another country.

• Import taxes / duties are your responsibility.

I'm selling a preloved Space65 with Holy Pandas lubed with Krytox205g0 with sound dampening foam and cut and lubed stabs with an extra plate. No dents or dings.

~~Selling my built KN2.10² in e-white/e-yellow as well as a GMK Merlin base set, and SA Vilebloom base set.~~

~~About the 60% KN2.10²: It is a sandwich mount keyboard with a 60% ANSI layout and hotswap pcb. It comes with the following:~~

* ~~Lubed, clipped (Zeals come clipped from factory), and band-aid modded Zeal stabs~~
* ~~Lubed and filmed 63.5g Turquoise Tealios~~
* ~~DZ60RGBV2 PCB~~
* ~~Sorbothane lined bottom case and KBDFans modular plate foam on plate~~

~~This keyboard sounds incredible and is super quiet. In full transparency, there are scratches to the plate from taking switches in and out as I tested them. There are also some scratches around the inner edges of the top case but both these and the plate scratches are not visible when the keyboard is put together. See the extra pictures if you want to check this out. This has been a great keyboard for me but I am making the leap to gasket mount. Selling for $300. SOLD~~

~~GMK Merlin Base: Used for a few months with a little shine, mostly to the gaming keys as I almost exclusively game with this keyboard. Have only used the keys that make up 60% ANSI layout. Comes with tray or can ship in bag for $10 less. Selling for $180. SOLD~~

To make it easier for buyers:

\- Shipping prices in eu generally are 4-15 euros (depends on various reasons (if it untracked or tracked), how big is the package)

\- Shipping prices to usa/canada generally are 20-40 (depends on various reasons, I have calculated estimated price for some already)

\- PRICE<60 € is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € for tracked;

\- 60=<PRICE<100 € is UNTRACKED unless +3.5 € for tracked;

\- PRICE=>100+ € items is sent via tracked/registered mail unless asked otherwise;

\*\* Buying zilent v2 in smaller quantities (20-43) is tad bit more expensive per switch than all 110 due to the same shipping price, packaging as 110. For example 40 switches would be 62 euros (shipping and pp fees included!). For more info pm me.

Please comment before PMing me and sending chat request, without comment chats will be ignored.

NOTE: Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive (due to overseas shipping) and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. To make it easier I simply include shipping and pp fees. EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually","[EU-LT] [H] MITO MONO Cable, Zilent V2 (62g), Cherry MX Red, DROP ALT, Other [W] PayPal"
