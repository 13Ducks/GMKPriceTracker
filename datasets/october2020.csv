&#x200B;

**UPDATE**: all the kits except the Pata Negra are sold. For now, I m planning to keep the Pata Negra kit myself. Thank you all for your interst.

&#x200B;

Happy Halloween everyone,

I m selling the following items-

*GMK Jamon*Included kits:a) **Core** kit aka Base kitb) **Numpad** kitc) **Spacebar** kitd) **Jamonelties** kit aka noveltiese) **Pata Negra** kit aka accent(?) kit

**All the kits** are brand **new** in box and **sealed**.

*Price*:

**Bundle A** (Core kit + Numpad kit+ Spacebar kit+ Jamonelties + Pata Negra) =  $530 + shipping in CONUS

Note that the asking price for all the kits included covers what I paid for these items. I just want to get back what I paid. I tried to price the bundles in such a way that, the bigger the bundle you get, the more discount you can get. So here are the smaller bundles pricing-

**Bundle B** (Core kit + Spacebar kit+ Jamonelties + Pata Negra) =  $499 + shipping in CONUS

**Bundle C** (Core kit + Spacebar kit+ Jamonelties ) =  $465 + shipping in CONUS

**Bundle D** (Core kit + Spacebar kit + Pata Negra) =  $425 + shipping in CONUS

**Bundle E** (Core kit + Spacebar kit ) =  $375 + shipping in CONUS

All these are discounted bundle prices. After a bundle with Core/Base kit is sold, I m open to selling any of the remaining kits.  A single kit will cost more than what it is priced in a bundle.

&#x200B;

**Please also read** below:

All the prices **include Paypal fees** and are **OBO(here OBO means or best offer, no bidding please)\_**.

All items are for sale in **CONUS** only.

Some other things to note-

a. No chat, **Direct message** only. Please **Comment before** PM

c. Feel free to **ask questions** in messages.

d. It is **not FCFS, Bundles preferred**

e. Response to messages can be delayed but I promise to reply to everyone asap.

f. If it is already the item will be marked as **\[SOLD\]**

Have a good day everyone."

Hello everyone, currently I am selling some things to be able to afford upcoming boards even though I probably have enough lol.

Opened once to check for missing caps

Hey everyone,

I have some nice stuff to sell; It's all first-hand stuff that I enjoyed using at some point, but as I'm progressively refining my keyboard tastes, some of those don't see much use anymore. 

All prices are in **euros**, **exclude** shipping fees, and **include** PayPal fees. EU buyers will be **prioritised**. 

I'll try to send everything as soon as I can, however things might take some time to get to you due to my country getting back into a lockdown.

**Have:**

* E-White Tofu60 B-Stock Case - I bought this B-stock case not too long ago from KBDfans. I didn't see any cosmetic damage on the outside but there may be some internally (I'll double check but they shouldn't be visible when built). I have a piece of neoprene inside of the case to reduce any pinging noise from the aluminum. **PRICE $75**
* ~~Instant60 Tsangan Hot-Swap PCB - Bought from Cannonkeys about 2 months ago. It has hot-swap, warm per-key lighting, RGB underglow, VIA compatibility, split backspace, and split right shift. The stabs are Durock screw-ins that are lubed with Krytox 205g0 and there are KBDfans foam stabilizer stickers. I have a white 2M GMK 7u spacebar that I'm willing to throw in for an extra $5 if needed.~~ **~~PRICE $65~~**
* Brass Plate - Purchased directly from KBDfans and I see no visible markings on it. Has a 2.25u left shift. **PRICE $45**
* 70x 65g Lubed/Filmed NK Creams - These were springswapped to 65g Tx springs, filmed with Deskeys Films, and Lubed with Krytox 205g0 on the stem and housing and 105 on the springs. Most of them have been swapped around in the board a few times but some may be more broken in than others. There should be like 2 or 3 extra so the real total is about 72x/73x switches. **PRICE $65**

Prices are open to negotiation but I'd prefer to sell everything as a bundle for **PRICE** **~~$240~~** **$230**. SHIPPING IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE PRICES BUT IT CAN BE NEGOTIATED. Additional pictures and information can be provided upon request. If prices may seen unfair then let me know and they'll be adjusted.

[https://imgur.com/a/zu2HOgR](https://imgur.com/a/zu2HOgR)

First before I go into the board I WILL NOT SPLIT THESE UP. I figured this would be the most effective way for me to get rid of both at the same time and at what I think is a great price! Reason for selling is I want to save for a more ""high end"" board and because I was able to snag a GMK set for a an amazing price from another user! (:

I got the Tofu case from another user from a trade I traded an ID80 for his black tofu with brass plate, GMK screw in stabs, foam for case, and dz60rgb\_ANSI. At the time I believe his asking price was $200 shipped CONUS. There will be parts of the board that have the anodization or paint missing I tried to picture it as best as I can. But as a warning this is a used board so there maybe some parts that have paint/ anodization missing. as stated above I tried my best to picture it.

Included with the board will be GMK First Love THERE IS SHINE MAINLY ON THE GAMER KEYS. So WASD and surrounding keys. I tried to picture it the shine isn't heavy because some of the keys still have a bit of that texture on it? If you've used GMK sets you should know what I mean! I originally bought this brand new sealed maybe 2-3 months during the start of quarantine for around $250 (Could be more but this price seems accurate.)  As per usual I don't really sell anything for a profit and am just looking for what I paid for (if it's still like new condition) and if it's used than less than what I paid for but still a reasonable price! I've seen like new or used once or twice sets go for around $210- 240ish. The only keys I've mounted are the keys you see here and the Function keys which are bagged. All other keys including the 7U and others will be shipped in a bag.

So the black tofu has the dz60RGB\_ANSI hotswap edition PCB, GMK lubed screw in stabs, foam for the case, and lubed and filmed (lubed with krytox 205g0 and deskeys gasket switch films) board sounds very thocky and pleasant! And for the keycap sets it's being considered used with shine! Since I don't want anyone to purchase this thinking that there's no shine on the keycaps!

My asking price is 320 SHIPPED VIA CONUS. As stated above I am not splitting these and am hoping that this goes to someone who will actually want a board to use. If you do decide to sell them when receiving that's on you and not much I could do lol. CONUS ONLY PLS, Comment first before PM. Thank you! Enjoy your night! And as I've stated since I don't want any miscommunications when purchasing you're purchasing a USED GMK set that will have shine and also a Used Tofu that will have some marks but nothing that will affect the board! Thanks

TLDR Asking $320 shipped bundled via USPS, CONUS only. Thanks"

[Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/FWVkGXl)

The keyboards in the timestamp are sold without keycaps.

[TGR A17 replica](https://imgur.com/a/XFzDd4T): bought from r/mm a couple of months ago, but was unfortunately [damaged](https://i.imgur.com/udzJTFD.jpg) in shipping (see pics); it is just a hairline crack on the top acrylic layer, but it does not affect the functionality whatsoever. Built on a black h87a (mini USB) with lubed Gateron Milky Blacks; types like a dream. Got a new main TKL so this is just gathering dust.  Can provide sound test upon request. $260 shipped, but can include coiled, grey mini USB aviator for an additional $40.

**Brutal60 (proto) +Instant60 PCB**: bought from local seller in July. Haven't been using this board lately so I might as well sell it; comes on a polycarb plate, baby blue C3 stabs, and shelf liner in the bottom part of the case. No visible flaws. Is not compatible with modern brutal60 parts due to it having different plate mounting points. Asking for $300 shipped, but can leave the NK Silk yellows (spring-swapped to Sprit 68g Heavy; uniformly re-applied with 205g0) for an additional $60.

**~~GMK Olivia++ with Spacebars Kit~~**~~: NIB sealed, and not willing to split. Wanted to gift to my sister, but went with giving Peach Blossom instead. $310 shipped.~~   **Sold for $300 shipped**

**ePBT Kuroshiro R2 (base+JP mods)**: Was part of the GB: mounted for pics, and used in a typing test. Took it off because I do not like the feel of ePBT when compared to ABS caps like GMK. $240 shipped

**~~SA Bliss Base:~~** ~~I wanted to like this, but uniform R3 was not my cup of tea. Used extremely lightly, about 2 hours max. $220 shipped~~ **Sold for asking**

**SA Ice Caps**: Bought this to make a [bootleg 'olivia' colorway](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/hrzcyz/i_wish_i_had_the_real_ones/) when combined with SA Bliss. Again, not my cup of tea due to R3 profile. Bundle with SA Bliss base to emulate the above for $275 shipped, or buy by itself for $70 shipped.

Please post before PM-ing. Due to current world affairs, priority goes to local (91030) and then CONUS.   I have based these off of recent sales, but if something looks off in the price, please discuss with me in PM. Cheers!"

Got this in today and it was a whole lot prettier than I had imagined. I kind of don't want to sell it that much now that I've seen it in person, but I'm posting it here if someone really wants it and I can use this money towards something that suits me even better since I'm more of a 65% guy (65% > 60%, literally), but I wouldn't mind keeping this beauty at all :)

**GMK Cafe Base and Spacebar Kit**

New, sealed

I thought I had secured a local buyer from my last post, but I haven't heard back for over a day (please message back, man), so I'm posting this bundle here since I got the Polaris today.

Oh, I forgot to include the Alpaca switches:

**75x Alpaca Switches (stock)**

The timestamp picture shows a bag of 150 Alpacas, but I'm only selling 75 of them because the rest is for personal use and I got some Tangerines yesterday.

~~Asking $51 + shipping~~ SOLD

I know that they are still in stock at PrimeKB, but this price is not really extravagant and I probably ship a lot faster than PrimeKB (no offense intended, great store).

For trades:

I'll add PayPal if necessary, but keep in mind that I'm not rich and don't want to blow over $1k (total, along with the Polaris and/or GMK Cafe bundle) on a keeb.

Boards I'm most interested in (many over $1k market price, but I want to try nonetheless because they're such nice keebs):

Yo!

Moving on from the colorway that brought me into this crazy hobby. Letting go of most of my precious Miami Nights artisans. Below are some details and prices. These are either what I paid or less. In some cases by a lot haha.

&#x200B;

Here's what I have. All caps are MX.

* **Navacaps Miami Nights Taka Collection - $240**
   * Only split I'll consider is if you buy everything except the pink striped one. Might keep that one.
* **SUK Keybuto III ""Toda La Noche"" Collection - $250**
   * Not splitting.
   * A commission from SUK. Comes with certificate he made.
* **ETF Facial Miami Blanks - $50 each**
   * If you buy one at double the price you get the other one **free**!
* **MitchCapped pink on black gamer set - $100**
   * Not splitting, of course.
* **MitchCapped Miami Nights gamer set - $100**
   * Also not splitting, of course. These are cyan on top with pink splotches on sides.

&#x200B;

As for what I'm after (besides money).

* **GMK Minimal** (or other GMK CP on WS1 sets; maybe GMK Hennessey)
   * Will take the whole set but I actually just want some mods and a few other keys from this. So if you want to sell/trade that let me know.
* **GMK WoB** (or other GMK WS1 on CP sets)
   * Again, whole set or mods/extras.
* **Southpaw Extended 65** (Silver or cerakoted white)
   * Just case is fine.
* If by chance someone here has guitar pedals they want to trade I'm down for that. Strymon Big Sky/Timeline, Line 6 DL4, TC Flashback 2.

&#x200B;

Shipping will be $7 for each purchase if CONUS. More if international. Down for local OC swap at Bottle Logic, Modern Times or Bruery. Please comment before [PMing me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Kozahtli).

Leopold FC660M - ~~$110~~ $85 USD + Shipping

First off, this board is practically in new condition. I just purchased this to use it for class while I didn't have a keyboard, and afterwards put the dust cover back on it and let it sit in my closet for a little while. It has been dusted using my high pressure air compressor, and looks basically brand new. Original packaging and all included. Tthis particular FC660M contains Cherry MX Reds, with no modifications to the board whatsoever.

Nightfox - ~~$150~~ $125 + Shipping

This particular Nightfox has Cherry MX Silent Black switches, lubed with Tribosys 3204, Dampening foam, Zeal stabs lubed with Keytox 205g0 for the shift, backspace, and enter, and a screw-in GMK stab for the spacebar lubed with Krytox 205g0, and band-aid modded. Very silent, very smooth, very bassy. This board has a slight issue with the R key, as it sometimes won't register a keypress, but pressing hard on the key seems to fix this problem for a long time. (Weeks.) So it's not a big issue at all, but I wanted to make sure you were aware. I think a simple desolder/resolder would make this switch work perfectly, but I'm blind so I can't solder/desolder out of concern for my safety.

DSA High Contrast Granite - ~~$120~~ $110 + Shipping

This is my favorite keycap set, and I'm so sad that it doesn't work with my new keyboard, but it's the full DSA High Contrast set. Absolutely love it, and I'm sure you will as well.

DSA Granite Text Modifiers - ~~$40~~ $30 + Shipping

Text modifiers from the DSA Granite set. Comes with a lot of extra keys as well aside from just the modifiers, as Signature Plastics sent these to me as a gift for some inconvenience we had, but now that I'm selling my main DSA set, I have no use for them, as I've converted to Cherry profile.

Hello!

Bought this circa-2017 Ergodox EZ off /r/mechmarket, and used it roughly for 1 year before switching to something smaller. Basic model (no backlight/RBG), with wristpads and tenting kit, and USB + TRRS cable. Unfortunately, I lost some of the original blank keycaps, so I've replaced them with some loose GMK Carbons I had around (as seen in the pic).

The board has a problem being recognized by windows when connecting it. Previous owner claims not to have had this problem so it might be something with my computer. Either way you should assume that you'll have the same issue. The fix though is rather simple by just plugging the cable in again, you might need a few tries but when it's recognized it works flawlessly. Issue only reappears when unplugging the keyboard again, turning the computer on or off doesn't affect it. Maybe there's a fix completely, idk.  | 450€ + shipping (keycaps on picture not included)

Hello everyone!

Dove into this hobby too fast. 

Comment before PM, no chat and chats will be ignored. Will answer PM's in the order received. 

All prices include shipping and fees. CONUS only. Priority to local 94580 and bundles.

**~~Kumo Minivan Bundle - $276 (price is firm and not looking to split)~~** **SOLD**

**~~Kumo Minivan~~** \- USB-C, VIA compatible, Kailh hotswap sockets. Will come with PCB board, case, stock caps, USB-C cable, and holster/case. Selling it because I quickly realized it’s not for me although it felt nice to type on.

**~~GMK 80’s Kid~~** \- This is the full kit and includes the extra mods, caps and Road Kit. All caps were barely used and are in excellent condition with absolutely no shine.

~~\*\*\*Optional upgrade.~~ This set does not come with any keyswitchs. In the pictures, I have C3 x TKC Banana Splits lubed with Krytox 205 and Deskey film. If you would like for me to include them, I can for an additional $45. Just let me know.

**Melgeek Mojo60 built - $400 (price is firm and not looking to split)**

Mojo60 Black Aluminum 60% case. Great condition. No scratches or chips on the exterior. The interior also in great condition with the exception of the mounts where the paint has chipped. I use PCB O-rings to protect the PCB and has worked without issue. This case is heavy. Also has a foam cutout that sits nice and snug. Compared to the NK65 E-white alum I had; this build is really quiet. I really don’t want to sell this build but I have to. 

DZ60RGB V2 ANSI Hotswap – Band-aid mod, Zugear (Durock) transparent Gold Plated stabs lubed with Krytox 205, PCB mounted with PCB O-rings to the case.

MG Ember Keycaps – only the ANSI set seen in the pictures. Includes matching grey spacebar and bee keycaps seen in pictures.

Gateron Browns lubed with Krytox 205.

\*\*\*Optional Keyswitch upgrade – I can switch out the Gaterons for Novelkeys Creams lubed with Krytox 105 and Deskeys film. An upgrade is an additional $60. If choosing the upgrade option, the Gateron browns will not be included in the bundle. 

The bundle also includes the matching Melgeek Keyboard case. 

**Keycaps**

**CMY Kit – DSA Profile -** **~~$20~~** **$17–** New, not opened, shipped in bags as seen in pictures. This was purchased off AliExpress. 

**DSA PBT Dye-Sub 30 Keys -** **~~$20~~** $17 – From KBDFans, mounted to see how it looks, silly me as I got the wrong profile. Mounted for less than a couple of minutes. Shipped in a box as pictured. Was originally purchased directly from KBDfan.

**~~HyperX Pudding Keycaps set – Black set and White set– $20 for both, sold together~~** **SOLD.** Used for 1 month. Great condition. Shipped in bags.

Hey Mechmarket!

Icarus flew too close to the sun and got ahead of himself chasing theme builds. Now he needs help cleaning his closet! Tried to price everything cheaper than anywhere else, if I missed something let me know.

\*\*I'm happy to lube/mod any switch or stab set per request. Just keep in mind this will increase cost and may add lead time to shipment.\*\*

To get the boring stuff out of the way:

* Prices include shipping, CONUS only
* Shipping will have tracking - Insurance provided on orders over $100
* **Prioritizing bundles**
* Comment before PM
* No reddit chats, please!
* Orders ship next day, unless otherwise stated

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for looking!

**Please comment before messaging me.**

Hi guys, as I have recently acquired some new keyboards, I am looking to sell some of my other ones.

**ID80 Kit**

This kit included GMK Screw - In stabs which have been clipped and lubed. Has the Idobao ID80 silencing foam.

**~~Drop Alt~~**

Due to a mistake, pcb had to have a trace jumped (~~[~~Image~~](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/j0s5c2/remember_always_double_check_before_screwing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) ~~- Not pretty but board fully functional.)~~

~~Stabs have been lubed and modded.~~

~~Will come with Kaihl Speed Silver Switches or Zeal Healios Silent Switches.~~

**Infinikey Hive Core Set -** Again mainly looking for trades on this one, but option for sale is available. Mainly interested in other Infinikey Sets, like Sanctuary Rebirth, or other PBT keycap sets.

Shipping rates:

• I’ll have to use an expensive expedited service, since the cheaper national carrier has been [rekt by Covid.](https://pos.com.my/journal/sed-ut-perspiciatis-unde-omnis-iste-natus-error-sit-voluptatem-accusantium-doloremque-4.html)

• For reference, shipping to CONUS would cost $55.

• Shipping price is the same ($55) for 1 or 2 sets due to the combined weight being below the minimum threshold, so please buy more than 1 item ;)

• PM me if you need a quote to another country.

• Import taxes / duties are your responsibility.

• Prices above are inclusive of PP fees. Local cash will be cheaper.

via DHL air in HK. There is gonna be a $5-7 surcharge on shipping to other parts of the world. Remote charge might occur depending on your address so please pm it to me to check. Feel free to msg me about shipping in Asia because there might be discount from the courier.

The typical timeframe is 1-2 weeks, including domestic shipping to the proxy, their processing time in HK (3 days usually), time that cargos waiting for pick-up at bay and the time on flight to the destinations. It is pretty reliable since COVID-19. [Here's some DHL tracking after they pick up the package.](https://imgur.com/a/czxgagT)

RAMA U80A Moon | Built w/ Gateron Silent Black Inks lubed with 205g0 and spring swapped with 65g TX springs and Durock Stabilizers lubed with 205g0. Comes with MT3 Susawatari Keycaps barely used. The pictures look like there is shine but it is just the nature of the plastic used. Also comes with extra Rose Gold external weight and Internal Dampener. The keyboard came with machining marks on bottom corner of the board straight from RAMA (Not caused by me). Not visible during use.

~~CannonKeys Navy Savage65~~ | ~~From the last drop. A-stock with flawless condition on the exterior. I believe there is some marks in the inside straight from CannonKeys but since its only the inside, it is considered a-stock by CannonKeys standards. Built w/ C3 Tangerines V2 (spring swapped to 65g TX Springs and lubed with 205g0) and Durock Stabilizers (Lubed w/ 205g0). PCB is millmaxed with 0305 sockets and the FR4 plate is the 6.25u spacebar variant. Comes w/ CannonKeys carrying case, sheet of neoprene foam inside the keyboard, and the polyfill in case you wanted that too. **Does not come with keycaps**~~ | **SOLD for 440$**
Switch Couture Matte Black Alice | Bottom is frosted acrylic to let the underglow RGB shine through. Will come with the extra matte black bottom piece if you wanted to swap it out.

Welcome to Donut's ""Oh fuck I'm the only one in the house with a job right now"" offloading of stuff round 1. Prices are based on what I could find info on, but also OBO, so hit me with offers cause I'm trying to be flexible. Shipping for artisans is $4/CONUS for singles, calculated by location for multiples.

Krytone Sheep - Bundle only, $450 - Krytone's old Topre stem that fits on most MX stems as well. I'm super fond of these caps and I've been super hesitant to let this group collection go, but artisans don't pay the water bill.  

Krytone Chickeys - $35/ea - Some are Krytone's aforementioned Topre/MX stems, some are MX only, as labeled in the timestamps. Part of my overall Krytone-centric collection. 

Krytone D'mons - $35/ea - All MX only. More Krytone stuff I've been holding onto for years now, including one I stopped in the middle of a 4hr drive home from uni to nab. Gold SOLD.

SUK Snapper ""Roastmallow""  - $80 - MX stem. My first artisan raffle win I've held onto almost four years now.

Crimson Cadet - $300 shipped insured conus OBO - Base kit, opened but never taken out of the trays. I had full intentions to do an entire themed build with this set until 2020 hit full stride. I'm immensely upset that I'm needing to sell it, but I'm actually on the verge of being literally out of money at this point."

[W] PayPal","Hey again /r/MechMarket! I'm here again to sell off soem of the boards that I have been collecting for a little while, and some keycaps that I don't really want anymore, so here goes!

Leopold FC660M - $85 USD (Not including shipping, but I'll be shipping via flat-rate, so price of shipping will be pretty low.)

First off, this board is practically in new condition. I just purchased this to use it for class while I didn't have a keyboard, and afterwards put the dust cover back on it and let it sit in my closet for a little while. It has been dusted using my high pressure air compressor, and looks basically brand new. Original packaging and all included. Tthis particular FC660M contains Cherry MX Reds, with no modifications to the board whatsoever. Here's a picture.

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PGIlKdz-xsx8dkmjKD-Y1jvHbgMFu56m/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PGIlKdz-xsx8dkmjKD-Y1jvHbgMFu56m/view?usp=sharing)

Nightfox - $130 (Not including shipping, but I'll be shipping via flat-rate, so price of shipping will be pretty low.)

This one was a personal favorite of mine. It's a Nightfox build that I purchased from someone here on /r/mechmarket. It was the first custom that really got me into this hobby, and the first one that I bought off of /r/mechmarket. It is packing silent mx reds lubed with tribosys 3204, has everglide stabilizers for shift, backspace, and enter, and a GMK screw-in for the spacebar. The spacebar is also band-aid modded, and all stabilizers are lubed with krytox 205g0 and dialectric grease. For full transparency about this particualr board-- the R key has been acting up. I'm blind, so I can't desolder due to the fear of harming myself, so I haven't been able to desolder and resolder it. But it does work. It works perfectly fine, it just has moments where it has a little issues, but presing hard on the key will fix it for a while again. Again, not sure what's goign on there, but figured if you're buying, you should know everything about these boards. I can't tell you how annoying it is to buy boards from here, only to find that they have issues the seller didn't alert you to. So there you go (: Here's a picture of this beauty.

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c-O8WPcOdgzlr5uRhclXrcltvLoZzR5G/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c-O8WPcOdgzlr5uRhclXrcltvLoZzR5G/view?usp=sharing)

DSA High Contrast Granite - $120 (Not including shipping, but I'll be shipping via flat-rate, so price of shipping will be pretty low.)

So for starters, these are my current favorite keycap set, and I'm sad to see them go, but they need a new home. I need some cash to fund a new build, and these keys don't workw ell with my current board, so it's time for them to go to another board out there. So this comes with the Common, and Icon Modifiers from PimpMyKeyboard for the DSA High Contrast Granite keycap set. Absolutely love these, sad to see them go, but happy someone else will have these on their board. (: Here's a picture.

DSA Granite Text Modifiers - $41 (Not including shipping, but I'll be shipping via flat-rate, so price of shipping will be pretty low.)

This is just the text modifier set, as well as a couple other keys that I'll throw in for free. Not a full set, but a god couple keys. In great condition, pretty much never used. I was sent these by Signature Plasitcs while they were testing out one of my boards to see if their caps didn't work well with their sets, and they said that I could keep these keys, so personally I don't really like them super duper much. So here's a picture:

Very eager to do some sales with all of you, so post below and shoot m e a PM if you're interested in any of these boards/keycaps! Have a nice day. (:"

hi mechmarket, I'm back again to sell/trade

This time, I have:

Keebs over $1k are definitely over my budget (already spent too much this month), but I would really like a Chimera (man, that thing looks so beautiful)

Feel free to PM me if you have any questions

**Note**:

Starting this morning, there has been a pretty severe fire going on in my city, and last I checked, it's still 0% contained (7200 acres burned so far). As such, I may not be able to drop off packages at USPS within 1 business day, though I will do so as soon as it is safe to go out. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Thank you and have a great day :)"

Hello! Back again looking to sell a few items. They're listed below:

* **Acrylic Tofu60 w/ 67g Zealios v2**
This board is built on a carbon fiber plate and the layout is 60% with arrow keys. Case is in like-new condition. Underglow looks great. *Asking $200+shipping*

* **80x Silent Alpacas, Stock**
Never used. Purchased from a user on MM as an add-on to another purchase and I already have a set, so I don't need these. *Asking $80+shipping*

* **90x NK Creams, lubed and filmed**
These switches are lubed with krytox 205g0 and filmed with clear kebo films. Love Creams, I just have too many switches right now and would rather use my resources for something else. *Asking $75 shipped*

* **GMK Dualshot, sealed**
Sealed set! Base set only. *Asking $300 shipped*

* **GMK Fro.yo**
This set has been opened and mounted with about 1.5-2 weeks' use. No sign of wear or shine whatsoever. Full base set. *Asking $225 shipped*

* **GMK Peaches and Cream**
This set is opened and has about 3 weeks of use on a secondary board. No shine. Full base set including novelty modifiers and arrow keys (these were part of the base set for this GB, but it's uncommon enough that it's worth mentioning I suppose). *Asking $300 shipped*

As always, prices are negotiable! If you are interested in something but think my asking price is unreasonable, let me know and I'll be happy to talk it out with you. I can ship the next day after confirmed purchase. Thanks!"

**Novatouch Bundle:** All the stuff I bought for this novatouch is going in here. This bundle contains: 

* Novatouch w/ BKE lights, silenced with hypersphere rings, lubed with EK mechlube 2, stabilizers greased; BKE lights are a mixture of old and new (old from the very first round on the alpha block, newer ones everywhere else, the older ones will be heavier than the newer ones)

* Original 45g domes (cut up to fit a realforce r1, but still perfectly working) and an extra set of conical springs

* Hasu USB-USB converter

* Extra case, plate, pcb (case has some scuffs, plate has no stab housings, pcb has non-working ESC key)

* Original packaging, cable, and set of rubber pads which act as o-rings (works well with cherry profile and shorter keycaps)

**Looking to get $400 shipped for the entire bundle**

~~**MX Silent Ink:** I have a total of 120x MX silent gateron ink switches, with these having the stems from cherry silent reds inside gateron ink v2 housings. They have all been lubed with krytox 205g0 on the slider rails, and the fronts and backs of the stem, and filmed. Springs installed in the switches have been oiled with victorinox oil. The configuration for these switches is a little weird, so read up:~~

~~* 90 switches with 67g tx springs (14mm), filmed with tx thick films from thicc films~~

~~* 20 switches with 67g tx springs (14mm) and filmed with kebo clear films, as the silencing material and any thicker films cause the bottom-out to be on the keycap instead of the stem for cherry profile r2 (at least on gmk caps)~~

~~* 9 switches with just the stock spring, filmed with tx thick films from thicc films~~

~~* 1 H1 switch with the silent red stem (accidently broke a switch lol)~~

~~Original ink springs are included.  **Looking for $125 shipped for the switches**~~ **SOLD**

~~**GMK WoB:** Bought from Amazon back in August and has been used on the novatouch for 2-3 weeks. Still in like new condition, as there's no shine and the texture is still present. Small amount of warping on 6.25u spacebars, and a bit more on the 7u, but both should still work fine. **Looking for $145 shipped in bags, or $140 + shipping if you'd like the trays**~~ **SOLD**"

Hi All,

I have a set of GMK 9009 R3 Base keys that are BNIB/sealed. I'm looking to trade them for a set of GMK Phosphorous. I need the base and numpad sets. I'd also like the spacebars, but that's optional. I don't mind if they're not brand new, as long as they're in good condition and all sets are complete. I'd add money (through PayPal G&S) on top of my GMK 9009 base set to make the trade equal.

Alternatively, if anyone wants to just sell me their GMK Phosphorous set, I'd be down for that too!

Please comment here before PMing and don't use chat. Thanks!

**Ended up selling for $200**"

Planck rev 6 W/NK blueberries, GMK red Samurai keycaps, and a dwarf factory terrarium artisan keycap. Looking to sell it as a package deal, not really sure on what to be asking for. Everything together brand new was around 270. The keyboard was only used for about a day before i realized i don't like NK blueberries. Looking for $180 for the whole keyboard.

90x Holy pandas. never used or even taken out of the package. Same reason as above, i don't really like tactile switches so just looking to recoup losses. Paid $100 so looking to get 90$

Planned a pink-theme build for the wife but she wanted an iPad instead, so I'm selling these to fund a new board.

1. **GMK Olivia++ Light Base + Space bar kit + Hihihi Rama Enter.** Everything is new and unused. I only opened the Base seal to check the quality of the new GMK packaging. Was not disappointed. I'm selling these as a bundle for $600 plus shipping **SOLD** (sorry about the high price, it's basically what I paid plus Paypal fee).
2. **Fox 80SE Pink-Coral colour, TKL layout**. This is Fox's 3-year anniversary board, and I was told this was one of the special limited colour. It's hefty and gorgeous. Kit includes case, PCB, black aluminum plate & underplate foam. Selling for $680 plus shipping **SOLD**
3. **Infinikey Graen Base + Mega addon kit.** New and never used. Selling for $190 plus shipping **SOLD** 

Everything to be shipped from Vietnam. DHL Express costs around $40 for keysets and $65 for the board. Shipping fees for keysets can be lower if the buyer is based in the US as I can use my US proxy, but the discount compared to DHL is minor and in my opinion, not worth it.

**Please comment before messaging me.**

Hi guys, as I have recently acquired some new keyboards, I am looking to sell some of my other ones.

**ID80 Kit**

This kit included GMK Screw - In stabs which have been clipped and lubed. Has the Idobao ID80 silencing foam.

**Drop Alt**

Had this for a few weeks but ended up getting an NK65 Entry and no longer having a need for it. Great little entry board. Has some foam and tissue between PCB and bottom of case to remove ping.

Comes with original key caps and accessories. No original box but will ship securely. Due to a mistake, pcb had to have a trace jumped ([Image](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/j0s5c2/remember_always_double_check_before_screwing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) \- Not pretty but board fully functional.)

Stabs have been lubed and modded.

Will come with Kaihl Speed Silver Switches or Zeal Healios Silent Switches.

**Infinikey Hive Core Set -** Again mainly looking for trades on this one, but option for sale is available. Mainly interested in other Infinikey Sets, like Sanctuary Rebirth, or other PBT keycap sets.

**NK65 Entry Smoke -** Only interested in trades for other 65% boards.

Shipping withing the EU Only.

|Matrix Abel+|Teal color, built with Thic Thock Marshmallows, Lubed, clipped and modded GMK Screw in stabs. Flawless condition, but has a small quirk with keymapping as many Matrix PCBS do. (L) Alt and (L) Windows keys position appear to be swapped. From what I've read the Abel+ PCB cannot be remapped, but I didn't invest a lot of time trying to figure it out. This will be a non issue for some and a deal breaker for others but wanted to make sure I put it out there. Shipped in original packaging. Keycaps not included|$700 / Trades|

&nbsp;

^1 - Vintage switches can vary in smoothness and working condition, even on the same board. Please note that I can not test every individual switch or provide an ""x out of 10"" rating of smoothness as that's highly subjective - anyone who does that is probably more interested in advertising their goods rather than trying to provide actual info.

^2 - Untested! Untested items are indeed not tested. I have no idea if they work fully or at all. Because they're not tested, y'know. If working condition is important for you, I can (depending on the item) perhaps go and try if it works.

~~Rama U-80A Lake Hotswap RGB- In fantastic condition.  Comes with original box, brass weight, and built with lubed MX stabilizers.  Does not include a dampener.  Board is super beautiful but I couldn't bring myself to build it without a matching GMK set (none of the sets I have work with this navy/gold combo ATM).  I have GMK Delta on the way that's going to make it's way onto this board if the KBD sells.~~  **~~Asking $1,300 shipped via Paypal to the CONUS~~** **SOLD to** u/businesskitteh

~~KBDFans Black Aluminum KBD67 MK II Hotswap RGB complete build- This board is currently built with krytox 205g0 lubed macho/banana split switches (I didn't find any sound benefit in filming these) and a GMK cafe set that is about 3 weeks old with no shine.  Includes original box and the rest of the GMK Cafe Base set including the original GMK box as well.~~  **~~Asking $700 for the complete set shipped via Paypal to the CONUS~~**

~~I have so many boards on the way from group buys that I can really only justify carrying one of these right now, so once one board is gone the other is off the market.  I may consider splitting up the KBD67 and I have some lubed filmed Kiwi switches I could swap into the board for a small replacement fee.  I'm open to international shipping as long as buyer pays shipping and has positive rep on mechmarket.  If you are planning on chatting me, leave a comment before doing so.  Open to local cash 10026 and may be open to trades for certain GMK sets (mostly ones that would match the Lake board since I'm happy with Cafe on the KBDfans).  I would also be interested in swapping the KBD67 for a polycarbonate version.~~

* Soldered In-Switch RGB Light (can be customized)
* Cherry screw-in stab (the old ones that were still good, taken care of)
* Absolutely no problems so far, only that there are 3 of screws missing, but you won't notice that

I feel bad as I don't have any usage for it now. Right now I am basically getting rid of my collection. I have been good at it (and the board on me) so I would be happy if it would found a good owner.

Hi!

I've got these two wonderful discipline keyboards to sell or trade.  [Album](https://imgur.com/a/pV4KSfd)

&#x200B;

|Keyboard|Info|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Fully Build Discipline|Gateron Yellows with Invyr Uhmwpe stems (and a Gateron black, 67.5g spring for the spacebar) lubed with 205g0 and filmed with thicc films, GMK retooled stabs also lubed (dielectric and 205g0).|£200 ono.|
|Discipline kit|All the components are soldered on except switches! Comes with a laser-cut case (I have standoffs required for the case but I don't have screws or standoffs for the feet). The case has some slight dents from the laser cutter, as seen [here](https://imgur.com/X15K8oA) and [here](https://imgur.com/xJH4cbI).|£150 ono.|

The cases are a little different from what is recommended on Discipline Github its mostly made out of 3mm acrylic for the top, spacer and the bottom parts and the plate is 5mm (stab holes have been widened to accommodate).

If there is a request for a typing test for the fully build board, I'm happy to produce one, the sound quality won't be amazing (it will be from my phone), but I can say this board does sound pretty good. 

Willing to trade for high-end keycaps such as GMK, Infinikey etc, open to anything just send me a PM of the set and I'll see if I like it but the main sets I'm currently after:

* GMK WOB
* GMK BOW
* GMK URSA
* GMK Minimal

Any questions, just PM me :)

Hello!

I am here now with several things for sale. I have gone a little too heavy-handed in buying things for this hobby, so I am looking to dial back the collection a little and move some neat things on to other people! What I have for sale is below:

**KEYBOARDS**

* **Tofu60 Acrylic Build w/ 67g Zealios v2**
This board is built with lubed Zealios v2 switches on a carbon fiber plate. Layout is 60%, but features arrow keys. Acrylic case is in like-new condition and the underglow from the PCB looks great. *Asking $250 shipped for this board*

* **KBD67 cases w/ built PCBs and plates**
I have two KBD67 cases (one E-white and one polycarb) that I want to sell along with either of the pictured PCB/switch/plate combos to make a full build. The combos are BSUN Holy Pandas, lubed, on an aluminum plate, and ZealPC Zilents 67g, lubed, on an aluminum plate. I am happy to pair either case with either PCB/switch/plate combo for any interested party. Both include case foam as well as clipped and lubed screw-in stabs. *Asking about $425 for either of these boards, but I am open to negotiating based on what you're interested in!*

**SWITCHES**

* **90x NK Creams**
These switches have been lubed with krytox 205g0 and filmed with clear kebo films, unused *Asking $85 for these switches*

* **67x Holy Pandas**
These have been lubed with Tribosys 3203, used briefly in HS board. *Asking $80 for these switches*

* **76x Holy Trash Pandas**
Lubed with Tribosys 3203, unused. *Asking $90 for these*

* **80x Silent Alpacas**
Stock switches, unused. *Asking $80 for these.*

**GMK KEYCAP SETS**

* **GMK Dualshot**
Sealed set. *Asking $300 for this*

* **GMK Peaches and Cream**
opened, mounted, and used for about two weeks. No shine. Includes full base set. *Asking $300 for this*

* **GMK Fro.yo**
Opened, mounted, and used for about one week on a secondary board. No shine whatsoever. Full base set. *Asking $225 for this*

All prices are negotiable! If you have other items you are interested in trading, I am willing to make swaps as well! Always looking for mid-range 65% boards and GMK keycap sets, or sets of 70+ switches. Willing to do partial trades and payment to anything as well.

Small writeup about 415keys stems:

The stems are much better than the V2 invyr ones. The INVYR are unusable, not as smooth, and overall just bad. These are really good in comparison. Less variation between stems and they fit most of the housings I tried very well. They are definitely very smooth and fun to use. Wobble isn't nearly as bad as the INVYR. Very nice stems (especially in gat/zeal housings!), I just didn't really enjoy them as much as I thought I would. 

Disclaimer: I cannot guarantee the housings you put the stems into will work, nor can I guarantee you will like them. I just stated what I have found thus far. I'm assuming the type of people who would buy PE stems are quite familiar with what they are, so I'm sure this disclaimer is not that useful anyway lmfao.

CONUS Shipping only. Can do local pickup to 95377 (Covid-19 safe only)

I heavily prefer to bundle. **Please ask about bundling** haha.

Hello r/MechMarket!

There is a lot of reading here but if you stick to the bold text you'll get the critical stuff. If something in bold interests you, THEN read the blurbs. I recently posted this for sale but I don’t think the appeal was there as I was trying to sell it as a bundle. CONUS ships free, Maple Gang pays shipping. NO EU, sorry.

**HEX.3C: Asking $220 Edit: Price cut due to removing a plate option. Recommend a solder build for this.**
Used for about a month. Comes with hardware/mounting materials (gasket/burger mount), a universal brass plate and the original black POM plate. POM plate has never been attempted but is likely better used as a half plate; brass has ultra-tight switch holes but is usable, I recommend it only if you’re going for a soldered build. Will include two foams and rubber dampener for the bottom of the case. Just want to explore larger form factors out there.

**AN-C PCBs: Asking $65 for Mill-Maxed and ~~$35 for De-soldered~~**
Been using the Hot-swap with ALU plate on the Mill-Max PCB. ~~Had built the Brass up with Zealios V2s but de-soldered to  split everything into separate sales. PCB was tested after de-soldering and everything was working properly.~~ They both have the original ALPs support. If you purchase the Hex and a PCB, I can throw in some the requisite lubed Durock stabs needed for $10 (clear stem, gold wire).

**Linears: x68 Creams for $75 (stock switches available rn on NK and Divinikey) or $90 for Durock L7s Lubed &amp; Filmed x69.**
Creams were lubed with 205g0 on housing and springs. L7s were lubed with 205g0 on housing and stems - GPL105 on 63.5g springs and filmed with Black Deskeys. They are in the board in the pic but I sprinkled a few at the bottom of the photo that kind of got cut off 😑. Ultra smooth for both batches. Only want to sell of one of these sets but message me regardless, might be willing to offload both sets of linears. 

**Strata Deskpad: $40**
Bought to match the keycaps, matches nicely. I’m not convinced I’m ready to sell off the Keycaps but I’ve got a RFPxNK_ Deskpad recently so I don’t need this one. Brand new, used for about 2 days then rolled up. Completely flat on roll out though which was amazing. I purchased the Deskpad for about $48 after shipping. It has seen very little use.

 **ePBT Miami Nights - *Maybe* asking for $65**
Depending on if I am able to get some caps that I want, I will sell these. Only caps that have been mounted are what’s seen in the picture. All great condition. Used as long as I’ve had the Hex. No shine. Have really enjoyed this set.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Trades/WTB:** 
These are things that I’ve kind of been browsing for but haven’t really nailed down an offering. Priorities go to sales tbh but if you have something that I list I'd considered a trade. Please PM me as I am highly interested in purchasing. Majority of funding is dependent on what I sell here but there is some PayPal in reserve.

-KBD8X Mkii (unbuilt kits only - Black, PC, or Dark Grey.)

-KBD75v2 (unbuilt kits only - Only looking for Black Anode. Brass weight is optional. Brass Plate preferred but not required.)

-PC Fanoe (unbuilt or built)

-NK65 Entry Smoke/Purple (must have detailed pics as there were many QC issues - not wanting to spend more than $130 but msg me nonetheless. Might spend a little bit more for purple due to its availability but we'll see.)

-KBD67 Mkii Hotswap Or Unbuilt kit (Preferably Ink Black or PC versions. Not my first choice but I’m interested nonetheless.)

-Klippe or Tofu (PC Versions or Dark Purple Tofu with Plate +/- PCB) 

**WTB/WTT Keycaps:**

Hi!

[TIMESTAMP](https://imgur.com/a/MGpkxqx)

I'm willing to sell my Tofu 60 , built with Brass plate, Zeal60 v2 hotswap with Holtities , Zeal stabs (Lubed and band aided) , Zilents v2 or Black Inks (Your choise) , and GMK red samurai TKL kit.

Price is 360€ . I could split and sell only the keyboard for 210€.

The keyboard has some internal scratches along with some scratches on the brass plate, not really noticeable during daily use. Sometimes when you change a switch the holtities might come off (Not really often) you can just put them back in. RGB leds are perfectly working and via compatible.

I will include to the order 100x TX switch films and some extra hotswap sockets to the order for free."

Sadly have to sell some of my favorite things. I'm a college student and usually make money as a photographer, but due to being high risk, I have not been able to take photos outside of the occasional portrait client :(. Need to get rid of stuff before graduation as well. Also, have finally gotten my hands on a board I very much love, and haven't been using anything else since. Local is 19104/University City/Penn area. 

Prices do not include shipping. The shipping price will be a rough estimate, shipping receipt will be provided and if the estimate was over the actual price a reimbursement will be issued! Keycaps can be shipped in boxes or bags (let me know which you prefer).

Keycaps:

~~[$100 -> $80 SA Royalty 60%](https://imgur.com/a/gCQwGQs) ANSI layout (7x 1.5u bottom row mods, custom Artisan spacebar to match set).

Pending for $80 with MX Master included. Jealous of this buyer :(~~

Keyboards:

When desoldering I burned two traces, repair is visible in red wire in timestamp. Board is fully functional. Comes with all original keycaps, minus Caps, Spacebar, and Esc key. This was my first 'real mech' and some of the caps have been lost to time. The space bar and escape key pictured DO come with the keyboard, as does [this brown carrying bag](https://imgur.com/a/5G3kHn0). If you need a cable let me know. I do not have a replacement OEM caps lock, but who needs that crap anyways (you can switch it to be a fn key with the PCB/Program function).

[~~$110~~ $110 Hifiman HE-400s](https://imgur.com/a/GXlLGcv) Open Back Planars. Used for the last 3 years. Pads swapped out in Feb, only selling because I recently replaced these with Hifiman Devas (which sadly don't match my setup nearly as well :( - these go great with SA Foundation though!). Comes with [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5O8S4M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) cable (purchased September this year because old cable was too short), as well as a cheap USB-A DAC AMP that also comes with a cable. The headband has snapped in the same place several times due to dropping, but a dab of CA glue fixes it every time. Hifiman sells replacement metal headbands that are pretty nice, too. 

Bundles?  
Let me know if you want to bundle anything together. If you are new to the hobby and are interested in linear switches, we can work something out for the GK-61 + NK Creams + keycaps, or something similar.

# Items for Sale / Trade & Timestamps
&nbsp;

Item | Timestamp(s) | Description | Want | Availability
---|---|---|---|---
~~West German Vintage MX Blacks^1 ^2~~ | [Album](https://postimg.cc/gallery/44t8Xpq) | D code, 1991. Some of the electronic components' legs looked sketchy so I opened a switch and, unfortunately, found out that there's some tarnishing on the copper leaves. Hence the low price. Nevertheless they feel great and could - worse comes to worst - be used as donors for stems and tops if they don't work consistently. | ~~75€~~ 50€ / Trades | ~~1x Available~~ **SOLD**
Greetech Blacks x110 | [Album](https://postimg.cc/njB7DXfR) | Bought in January 2019. Plate mount. | 25€ / Trades | 1x Available
GMK Nautilus Base + International + Spacebars, Linjär Switches x120 | [Album](https://postimg.cc/gallery/5JNfhLf) | Set these aside for a meme project that never became a thing. Passing the meme torch on. Some shine on some keys, refer to album for details. **Spacebar kit only comes with blue 200/225/275 spacebars!** Will consider splitting but priority goes to bundle. | ~~350€~~ 300€ / Trades | 1x Available
Siemens FZ 6028 BTX Keyboard^2  | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/TsvAhxd) | Really cute little thing. Comes with original box (doesn't appear to have been used, but rather stashed in some sort of TV cupboard, hence there's some yellowing on one side), and some funny paperwork. BTX was some kind of Teletext protocol that came up (and flopped) in the late 80s. MX Blacks, doubleshot caps (tertiary legends are green-ish print).  | ~~75€~~ 65€ / Trades | 1x Available
~~NIB ""OTY"" wireless G81-3xxxHAD^2~~ | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/1qeXSfQ) | Cherry MY board with WOB doubleshots that has been turned into... a really posh thing by a German company specializing in that. If you don't know why you'd want this, you're, uh, erm, uncultured! With this board on your desk clients and colleagues alike will know you mean business.| ~~100€~~ 90€ / Trades | ~~1x Available~~ **SOLD**
Vig Keys G80-LPCXX-2^2 | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/8oh9FOn) | New without box. This is the engraved version of a Cherry MY keyboard for visually impaired people. If you send me a timestamp with your Grandparents or somebody else who could get actual use out of it that's not *haha lol big letter keybab on my shelf*, I'll cut you a deal for half my asking price. **Caution**: Winkey G81 boards have caps with an offset bottom row that won't work with customs, unless you specifically design one for them. | ~~75€~~ 60€ / Trades | 1x Available
Sun G81-3219HAD^2 | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/2W7xASN) | Cherry MY board that used to be paired with equipment to analyze exhaust gasses of cars. Condition is, as depicted, very authentic and fresh from the workshop. This would need a lot of love to restore. | ~~75€~~ 50€ / Trades | 1x Available
Tandon G81-1251HAD^2 | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/xsWNROK) | Neat Cherry MY board with Tandon branded 1000 series case and doubleshot caps. Uncleaned. Caps are well shiny. | 50€ / Trades | 1x Available
Artisans/Novelties | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/56uJihN) | Getting rid of artisans I acquired in hopes of being able to trade them for some stuff. Looking for 90€ each for the ETFs, 60€ for the Gothcap, anything else, shoot me an offer - idk what these are or how to price them. Would happily give a hefty bundle discount despite already taking a loss as is. | Trades / Paypal | **SOLD** except for 4/20 ETF

&nbsp;

^1 - Vintage switches can vary in smoothness and working condition, even on the same board. Please note that I can not test every individual switch or provide an ""x out of 10"" rating of smoothness as that's highly subjective - anyone who does that is probably more interested in advertising their goods rather than trying to provide actual info.

^2 - Untested! Untested items are indeed not tested. I have no idea if they work fully or at all. Because they're not tested, y'know. If working condition is important for you, I can (depending on the item) perhaps go and try if it works.

Keycult 1/60 Black/Brass - Unbuilt. The board is b-stock, but outside of the miniscule spec on the back it looks absolutely flawless. The board comes with 1x unopened PCB, 1x full polycarbonate plate, and 2x brass plates. Asking $1800 local or $1950 shipped to CONUS.


GMK Sandstorm - Just picked up this kit the other day with a very specific build in mind. Unfortunately, once I got everything put together I realized that it wasn't exactly everything that I hoped it would be. Therefore, I decided to look to see what trades I might be able to get. I'm open to any GMK set atm, so please feel free to send me an offer and we can talk about it.This kit has only been used for a day, I plan on swapping them out tonight. The previous owner had used it for around week. Absolutely zero shine.

Just picked up this kit the other day with a very specific build in mind. Unfortunately, once I got everything put together I realized that it wasn't exactly everything that I hoped it would be. Therefore, I decided to look to see what trades I might be able to get.  I'm open to any GMK set atm, so please feel free to send me an offer and we can talk about it. 

The Sandstorm kit has only been mounted for pictures. The previous owner had used it for around week. Absolutely zero shine. 

Thank you!"

Bought this keyboard on an impulse, but am not a fan of the 60% form factor.  Beautiful case with no observable issues and good weight.  The PCB is brand new from KBD as well as the stabs. Switches were mounted to make sure everything on the PCB works and no issues identified. Since this is a hotswap, you may need a plate to get good mount w/o wobble.  Selling everything together.

Hi everyone,

Went a little crazy this past month buying keyboard stuff, so I'm looking to sell off some things. Need them gone ASAP (looking to join the d65 GB) so all prices are OBO.

All prices do not include shipping. Only shipping to Europe I'm afraid, no international shipping this time :(

&#x200B;

|Item|Notes|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Rama M60-A Moon|Has a couple of minor blemishes on the front bezel, but I don't see any other flaws (PM for more pics). I'm looking for a mid to high-end 65% as a replacement for this, so PM with trade offers if you want! Shipped in original RAMA box.|£570|
|GMK Cafe Base SOLD!!! + Black (Dark Alphas) Kit|Used sparingly on my M60 for about 10 days before realising I need a 65% board. Black kit is opened but unused (apart from the 7u spacebar). Shipped in original GMK packaging (or bags if you want to save on shipping)|£210 and £110 respectively, or buy both for £310|
|Biip 2048 Topre Base Kit SOLD!!! |Used for 2 weeks before changing my mind on HHKB (again, need that 65% layout!).|£65 (much cheaper than buying directly from kbdfans, which would run you close to £100 including import taxes)|
|HHKB Pro 2 Bluetooth SOLD!!!|Comes with black printed keycaps. This has Yang's bluetooth controller inside, which allows you to connect the board to your PC wirelessly, and also program the board using the YDKB Software. Also, sliders have been lubed and the board is modded with silenced x rings. Shipping in original HHKB packaging WITHOUT a battery (Royal Mail doesn't allow battery shipping). I'll send a link to where I bought my battery though. I'll also include the original HHKB controller in case you want to switch back.|£210 (again, much cheaper than if you bought a new one for £185 and then purchased x rings and the bluetooth controller for close to £70). If you buy the biip keyset AND the HHKB, you can have em for £260)|
|Niu Mini|Built with lubed gateron ink blacks and blank black DSA keycaps. Bought from another r/mm user who used it for a few weeks, and I have not used it at all.|£115|
|Tofu 65 Black Hotswap Kit SOLD!!!|Comes with DZ65 RGB Hotswap PCB, Aluminium Plate, GMK screw in stabs (clipped, lubed, and band aid modded), and case foam. Only flaw(s) are the minor blemishes on the brass weight on the bottom (PM for pics), apart from that the case is in pristine condition. If you REALLY don't want them to be visible, you can always just flip the weight over :) This is a perfect beginner board, all you need are switches and keycaps and you're ready to go!|£160 (you'd be spending at least £40 more buying directly from kbdfans)|

Trades wise I'm interested in any cool, mid to high-end, 65% or spaced out 75% (i.e. not like KBD75) layout board. I'm a sucker for boards with rounded corners (like space) so would be very interested in one of those! Also interested in the following keycap sets:

GMK WoB

GMK Oblivion

SA Oblivion

GMK Night Runner (particularly interested in this for my space65)

GMK Terminal

MT3 Susuwatari

Any other interesting sets!

&#x200B;

Thanks for your time"

Hello mechmarket !

All prices are OBO, **do not hesitate to shoot any offer.**

Prices do not include shipping, they will be calculated on a case-per-case basis. I have some pretty cheap shipping options in France, even for heavy items and international shipping, but keep in mind COVID made them a bit more expensive tho.

&#x200B;

Additional imgur albums are available for most items.

(Metropolis and switches can be seen on timestamps but aren't available anymore)

PRICE DROP ~~$600+shipping~~ $580 shipped

Hello guys, I am selling my dark gray winkey JER A06 R2. Built with retooled cherry blacks lubed with 204, filmed and with 60g TX springs inside. Gmk screw-in stabs also lubed with 204. Keycaps are not included.

The keyboard is in good and clean condition: no flaws, scratches, dents. Comes with its original packaging, PCB hasn't been desoldered before, but if you don't want the switches, I can desolder and send the switches separately.

I am selling it because I need some funds to cover the purchase of the new keyboard I'm buying."

Hello, [r/mechmarket](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/) !

&#x200B;

I recently got GMK Dots in a trade and then realized I don't touch type (yeah, I am not worthy of this hobby, I know).

So I am looking to trade it for a cool GMK set. Since prices on most sets are INSANE right now, I wanted to trade instead. Priorities are GMK Olivia++ Light base with RAMA enter (will add paypal on my side). Also I like Taro, Phantom, Dolch, Serika.

Hey everyone, I'm looking to sell a full set of never used GMK Hyperfuse Remix keycaps. I bought them  during the first preorder window with the intention of using some of the modifier keys only. I decided to wait for my current set to show some age before actually using them though. Fast Forward to now and I'm still using my current HFO set and this pandemic has me in a spot financially.

Wasn't sure on a good asking price considering this set is no longer available and mostprior listings I saw were for used or partial sets.

|**GK64S** | Used for about a month, hotswapped twice. It includes the aluminium plate that came with the GK64S aluminium case, which I modded to fit in the Tofu 60 and support PCB mounted stabs. As you can see in the pictures, the plate is pretty roughed up. I would suggest getting a separate plate altogether, but I'll still throw it in with the PCB. It also includes the battery that came with the GK64S and some GMK screw in stabilizers lubed with 205G0. I can also include the original GK64 aluminium case, but do note it will kind of look weird when built with the provided plate since I sanded down the plate corners to fit in the Tofu 60.  | ~~$50, $70 with the GK64 aluminium case~~ **SOLD [here](https://reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/jeri3f/caqc_h_tofu_60_silver_gk64s_pcb_w_paypal)**|

For context, I'm completely out of the hobby and have been for years now. I know this keyboard may be controversial but I am not really looking to have a discussion about it. I am just hoping to sell this keyboard to another person who will appreciate it. I am looking to sell my replica Silver WKL Koala with brass insert that I got from a Korean group buy via a Korean based GH member named Naasby. I am the only previous owner of this keyboard. (I am radio_killah on GH)

I built it myself very early in 2017 after buying the board in late 2016. The keyboard has a brass weight in the case and a brass plate. It is built using one of Leeku's Jigon 87key PCBs and stickered ergo clears that I ordered from GON. The stabs are a set of the gold and clear screw in stabilizers from ZealPC. It has a dense foam liner for sound dampening. The brass weight in the base of the case has a clear plastic tape over it to prevent tarnishing. The brass plate is in good condition with minor signs of tarnishing. This keyboard has spent most of its life in drawer inside a keyboard bag.

I used this keyboard with a set of Round 1 GMK 9009 which I still have and can bundle with the keyboard if interested.

I am asking $2000 via paypal invoice for this keyboard."

Hi guys,

I want to sell my black Tofu 60% Hotswap buyed on 25th august, cause it was my first custom keeb and i noticed i really prefer the 65% layout with arrows, and as you can see from the timestamp i moved already to the 65% layout.

Anyway this is the build :

\- KBDfans Tofu 60% aluminum case × 1

\- DZ60RGB-ANSI v2 PCB HOTSWAP × 1

\- Brass 60% plate × 1 ( with adesive KBD module foam)

\- DZ60RGB-ANSI Case Foam × 1

\- GMK Screw-in Stabilizers × 1 ( with KBDfans Stabilizers foam sticker and lubed with Superlube grease)

\- Novelkey x Kailh Linear Cream Switch x61 (lubed with krytox)

I really prefer to sell all the bundle keyboard + switches and im looking for 250€ plus shipping ( around 10€ in EU) , that is the price i payed without the customs fees. Only EU buyers.

If you're interested just comment and PM"

Hi all,

I'm clearing out some of the things I never use. Europe preferred, but can do outside of Europe too. During covid times, shipping can get costly but I'm happy to get quotes. Let me know where you live :)

I prefer shipping with DHL, but I might be able to get something else to work, in a pinch.

1. MG Ember Dusk kit: Unused, new in box (only opened to look at) - 150 euros \*\*PENDING\*\*
2. Drop + RedSuns GMK Red Samurai ORTHO kit: used lightly, can't see any shine - 80 euros
3. SA Vilebloom ORTHO kit: unused, unopened, new in bag - 85 euros \*\*SOLD\*\*
4. SA Vilebloom ERGODOX kit: unused, unopened, new in bag - 95 euros \*\*SOLD\*\*

&#x200B;

SA keycaps really do just ship in these little baggies from Signature Plastics, but they are in perfect, factory new condition. I have not opened these baggies.

This is almost exactly what I paid for these kits originally.

If you have any questions, let me know!

\*\* MG Ember kit is pending sale until the 26th, (or if the buyer falls through), after that, it's free to anyone with the money lol"

Hi mm, I am parting with these Oblivion V2 kits. New and unused, still in plastic wrapping. 

No FCFS I'm afraid, priority goes to nordic and EU buyers, because of shipping cost and the uncertainty of everything at this point.

My asking price is 305EUR before shipping for both kits. I prefer to sell as a bundle, but let me know if you are only interested in one of the kits, and maybe we can figure something out.

Hey mm, hope y'all are well tonight. I'm still trying to sell a couple of boards. If you're interested and have any questions about either board please feel free to send me a PM and we can talk about it.

So, first up tonight is an unbuilt black/brass Keycult 1/60. This is such a dope board, and over the last few weeks of posting it I've been getting more and more sentimental about letting it go. Ultimately, I did find my dream board so I'll never be able to justify keeping this. The board is b-stock, but outside of the miniscule spec on the back it looks absolutely flawless. The board comes with 1x unopened PCB, 1x full polycarbonate plate, and 2x brass plates. **Asking $1875 local or $1950 shipped to CONUS.**

~~Next up is a black Tofu 60%. It has a hotswap DZ60 with the arrow key layout, NK creams lubed with 205g0, and smokey durock stabs lubed with 205g0. For this I'm asking **$220 local cash or $250 shipped.**~~ SOLD for asking

Okay now that all that junk is out of the way let's get down to the **REAL** important dealings tonight. I was lucky enough to buy GMK Sandstorm off of a really nice person here on mm. Unfortunately, I realized too late that the base kit does not come with support for 66% keyboards. All I need is a 2.25u shift from someone who has an extension kit. If anyone would be kind enough to offer up theirs I would really appreciate it, and I'm sure we could work out something fair when it comes to price.

That wraps it up for me tonight. If you're reading this I hope you have a safe weekend. Please, if you have any interest in any of my items, **comment before you PM and do not use reddit chat.**"

&#x200B;

[Rama Koyu Mist](https://imgur.com/a/6FGFx8M) ($800)

\- Fully functional and comes with hotswap pcb, internal dampener, original box. Original box is damped (practically destroyed) from shipping but will include it anyways.

[Canoe timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/6UcUGBe)

This is a Canoe Gen2 in the limited edition EVA-01 color way built with Custom EVA-01 frankenswitches. The frankenswitches were created and lubed by reddit user ChanDaddyPurps which consists of NovelKeys Dry Series Bottom Housing with Gateron x MiTo Laser Tops, V2 C³Equalz Tangerine Stems, 67g Gold Plated Springs, and Orange TX Films. The C3 grey stabilizers and the switches are both lubed with Krytox 205g0. The keyboard currently has the included black gaskets from the original packaging, which are softer than the red gaskets, also included in the package. The green aluminum weight is currently installed rather than the polished brass weight. Included in the package are all the accessories that originally came with the package: the red gaskets, the red and blue LED light diffusers, polished brass weight, and internal foam that I chose not to install. There is neoprene foam packed inside to reduce reverb, and the overall typing feel is still very firm, yet extremely smooth thanks to the switches.

__All shipped prices are to CONUS. Please inquire for international shipping rates.__

The recent delivery of the [Function96](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/jbd843/function96_v1_its_alive/) is pushing a few things out of the stable:

1.	~~Cannonkeys Rekt1800 Black, Unbuilt (De-built?) | This is a fantastic 1800/CP layout board. Why? It doesn’t cost a fortune, it doesn’t weigh a ton, it looks downright austere, and it sounds great due to the combination of burger mount, FR4 plate, and polyfill. I originally received this board built with Inks, and I’d advise a similar build to the buyer. However, it comes as a kit, so you can build it however you want! PCB desoldered with FR-301 and cleaned with isopropyl. During cleaning, diode D76 came off due to a cold solder on one side. I replaced it with a diode of slightly larger size (see photos). Everything tweezer tests just fine. The chassis does have a small anodizing defect on the back near the USB-C cutout. It’s a white spot, not a scratch, and I’m not sure what could have caused it. Comes with 6.25U plate, 7U plate, PCB, fasteners, polyfill, and Cannonkeys soft carrying case. Asking for $550 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

2.	~~Iris Rev3 built w/Gateron Milky Yellows, C3 stabs | Some say that split ergo isn’t done correctly without tenting, well, with this board it’s not a problem. Sandwich case with aluminum switch plate, aluminum bottom plate, and thick acrylic tenting mid-layer. Included bolts thread through the eyelets in the acrylic mid-layer, and are covered with rubber sleeves (included) to not mar your desk. Tremendous flexibility in how you choose to tent it. Switches are lubed, but I am not certain of the lubricant used. Includes some spare standoff hardware. Does not include USB or TRRS cable. Asking for $155 shipped~~ **SOLD for $150 shipped**

3.	~~Doubleshot WoB keycaps of unknown origin | Received these with a board. These are quality Cherry profile keycaps, with crisp legends and no warp on the long keys. I believe this set may be sold on Aliexpress, but I’m not sure. Coverage for ANSI 108-key and beyond, including split space and 6U (!) spacebars. Asking for $50 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

4.	~~MDA Big Bone TKL keycap kit | Tried out the MDA profile on these caps. The keycap surfaces are positively enormous and almost flat, a very very unique look for any keyboard. The legends are huge and crisp, dyesub on PBT. Coverage for ANSI TKL and any subset of that. Asking for $65 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

5.	**Geekeys PBT Dark Grey keycaps** | This set is of lower quality than the others in terms of the keycap finish (glossier rather than textured), but the long keys are not warped and it’s perfectly typeable. Cherry profile, with coverage for ANSI 104-key as well as Tsangan and 6U (!) bottom rows. Some shine on the caps, see photos. **Asking for $35 shipped**

6.	**Drop CTRL stock Shine-Through keycaps** | Full TKL keycap set from a Drop CTRL. No shine on the keycap surfaces. OEM profile for LED clearance, and the legends are on the north side of the switch. **Asking for $39 shipped**

7.	~~Kailh Box White (qty 48) & Navy (qty 32) Combo | This is perfect for a combination of Whites on alphas, Navy on mods, or for populating a split ergo board. Navy switches are unused, Whites are desoldered, and they’re all 3-pin. Not splitting up this set. Asking for $30 shipped.~~ **SOLD for asking**

8.	**Zealios V2 67g (qty 132)** | Unmodified, unused Zealios V2 67g keyswitches. 5-pin. Not splitting up this set. **Asking for $140 shipped**

9.	**Kailh Pro Purple (qty 97)** | Desoldered from a board. Switches do not appear to be lubricated. **Asking for $45 shipped**

10. ~~Cherry RT Blacks (qty 99) lubed & filmed | Unused, already lubed w/205g0 and filmed with TX films. Stock springs. Asking for $66 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

11. ~~Cherry RT Blacks (qty 48) lubed & filmed w/63.5 slows | Desoldered from a Planck. Lubed with 205g0, filmed with TX films, and spring-swapped with Sprit 63.5 slows.  Asking for $33 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

12. ~~Novelkeys Nolive Creams (qty 65) lubed & filmed | Desoldered from an alice board. Lubed with 205g0, filmed with clear TX films. Asking for $40 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

13. ~~MOD-M Tactile (qty 68) lubed | Desoldered from a 65% board. Lubed with 205g0. Asking for $30 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

14. ~~MOD-L Tactile (qty 88) lubed | Desoldered from a TKL board. Lubed with 205g0. Asking for $40 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

15. ~~Cherry Reds (qty 99) lubed | Pulled from a hotswap board, never soldered. Lubed with Finish Line PTFE superlube. Asking for $25 shipped.~~ **REMOVED from sale**

16. ~~KBDFans Blue Acrylic Lube Station | Unused. Asking for $38 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

**Built Black KBD67v2 MKII** with:

- Brass Plate
- Drop Holy Pandas Lubed w/ Tribosys 3203
- Genuine Screw-in GMK Stabs; clipped, housing lubed with Krytox 205g0, wires lubed with Permatex Dielectric Grease; wires have been rebalanced; band-aid modded

I've used this board for about 2 months and have decided that the board is not for me. The sound is good, but I don't think it's what I'm looking for. I didn't like the sound of a brass plate as much as I thought I would. It's very lively, but slightly higher pitched than I would have liked, so I am putting this up for sale. [Here is a sound test with Matt3o MT3 /dev/tty keycaps.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WItq9eMfKEM) 

The board can be de-soldered and split, but preference will go to those who inquire about the built board. If desired, I can include the coiled USB-C to USB-A cable with the purchase free of cost.

**Asking for $415 shipped, $395 local pick-up**

**De-soldered is $345 shipped, $325 local pick-up**

**If you would like to purchase the board de-soldered and pair it with the Kiwis or the 62g Zeal Zilent v2s, PM and I will let you know the cost.**

These will be shipped in a bag. These switches are extremely smooth with a nice and pronounced tactile bump. I'm selling these because I don't like silent switches as much as I had hoped. I realized that I love the deep thocky sounds of normal switches, so I won't be using these. 68 were mounted on a hotswap board, 1 was soldered.

**Asking for $105 shipped, $100 local pick-up**

**80x Stock C3 x TKC Kiwi Switches**

Shipped in a bag, 2 have been mounted and soldered to for a sound and typing test. I'm not a big fan of the sound on the Kiwi switches, but they're made extremely well with little to no housing movement.

Shipping rates:

• I’ll have to use an expensive expedited service, since the cheaper national carrier has been [rekt by Covid.](https://pos.com.my/journal/sed-ut-perspiciatis-unde-omnis-iste-natus-error-sit-voluptatem-accusantium-doloremque-4.html)

• For reference, shipping to CONUS would cost $70 for the Norbacase, or $55 for the GMK sets.

• Shipping price is the same ($55) for one or both GMK sets due to the combined weight being below the minimum threshold, so please buy both together ;)

• PM me if you need a quote to another country.

• Import taxes / duties are your responsibility.

______

Comments on the Norbatouch prototype:

• Matching riser feet are included.

• Powder coat is a touch uneven. The top case can pivot slightly against the bottom case if pressure is applied at certain angles, resulting in a rocking motion. This can be minimized / eliminated with tape + some patience.

• A couple of the screw holes are improperly tapped.

• Some scratches / scuffs are visible from up close, but they’re generally minor especially given the age & designation of the item. Don’t buy if expecting to be flawless.

• I would consider this more of a collectible than a keyboard case (because it’s Norbauer’s first project), which is why I’m apprehensive about using it, but that’s just my misguided sentiment.

______

Other notes:

• Prices above are inclusive of PP fees. Local cash will be cheaper.

• Not FCFS. Will give priority to folks who can meet locally, or people purchasing multiple items.

* **Everything is new** unless stated otherwise.
* Prices don’t include shipping unless stated otherwise.
* Only shipping CONUS for now.
* Pm first.
* Not necessarily fcfs.
* Bundles / trades get priority.
* Prefer to ship keysets in bags. I know that sucks, but it's a lot cheaper and I don't have big boxes that fit GMK sets.  If you really want your GMK Box, we can work something out.

NYM84

* With Soldered Gateron Yellows (Lubed with 205g0)
* Durock Stabs (lubed with 205g0)
* KBD75v2 PBC
* All working, but scuffed a bit
* KBD75 foam inside
* Without caps

UT47v1

* With Cherry MX Silent Blacks (Lubed with 205g0)
* Soldered In-Switch RGB Light (can be customized)
* GMK screw-in stab (the old ones that were still good)
* Absolutely no problems so far, only that there are 3 of screws missing, but you won't notice that

Typing experience is unreal and the small form factor really makes it special in my opinion. That being said I really want to upgrade into a larger form factor (65% and MGA Alice), as such I am more than willing to add paypal towards any interesting trades.

Tofu 60 Silicone Case Dampener: this dampener was casted to completely occupy every bit of empty space in the case from every curve to crevice. The dampener comes right up to the case standoffs to ensure a snug fit against the PCB; virtually eliminating all vibration. As shown in the pictures, this dampener is very malleable and can be easily cleaned by rinsing with water.

Just bought another keyset, so it's time to pocket some cash and sell this set. I've had it mounted on a board for around 3 weeks but used pretty sparingly (less than 3 hours a week), absolutely no shine from what I can tell (I should hope not!) Please note that the Infinikey Graen is missing certain keys (refer to TKC website) and I will be shipping them at no cost to you as soon as I receive them.

Price is 370€ .I could split and sell only the keyboard for 250€.

The keyboard has some internal scratches along with some scratches on the brass plate, not really noticeable during daily use. Sometimes when you change a switch the holtities might come off (Not really often) you can just put them back in. RGB leds are perfectly working and via compatible.

I will include to the order 100x TX switch films and some extra hotswap sockets ."

Hi everyone,

I'm selling the GMK Cafe Base Kit and Dark Alphas (Black) Kit. It has been used lightly on my M60-A for the past 2 weeks, and only mounted (never used) on my Niu Mini. I'm looking to get £315 + shipping for it, which is less than what I paid for the set. 

I will also consider trades for the following:

 - ALF F62-PE 

 - IBM Model F62 ""Kishsaver"" Replica

 - Other cool chunky boards, send me your offers!

I'm only shipping to the UK at the moment, but I will consider EU shipping as well if there is enough interest. It will be shipped in the GMK trays displayed in the timestamp.

Another thing to consider is that this will fill some combinations of 2 boards with different layouts. So it's not horrendously expensive if you split the cost over 2 boards :)

Lily58 - I have a built Lily58. I 3D printed a white case and plate, but I also have a black metal plate it came with. I could 3d print a black or red case if gou prefer for a bit more money. It is having issues with the “M” key not registering. But all other keys work. Has OLED screen and an elite C on the left side unit. I never really used it as I like 60% or 96% boards more. It has Pale Blue Switches in it. As well as TKC turquoise Blank caps I can include for 20$ more. I’d do 125$ for just the lily59 and case, and 150$ + Shipping for total build w/ all the turquoise cap set.

I’d consider trading for a black or white built KBD19x or similar with linear switches.

Letting go of more things for upcoming things -- just shipping, really.

I can ship internationally; just ask for a quote, and total price will be calculated accordingly. If in rare cases of Local Cash, I live at 95472.

Please ask if you have any questions or inquiries. Offers are welcomed.

**KBD8X MKII and KBDPAD MKII** \-- Good condition.  [Album 1 (Most recent condition)](https://imgur.com/a/ayOrTl8)  [Album 2 (When it arrived)](https://imgur.com/a/mJPAOOL)  For the board, the black top is A-stock while the e-white is B-stock.  For the pad, the e-white top is a-stock and the pink top is C-stock (defective).   Please, please, please inspect the pictures and see for yourself what you're getting into -- I've documented pretty much every little defect on the boards.  The board as a whole is in relatively good condition, but not exquisite.  This board was from the original Group Buy from April of last year, as shown by the brass weight.  Please ask questions if you need more info.

This bundle includes:

* A **de-built e-white KBD8X MKII** with an **extra black aluminum top**.  A full polycarbonate plate and a used but cleaned and working PCB accompanies the board, with a total of *one* plate and *one* PCB for the board in the bundle.
* A **PCB-Case sound-dampening foam** and a **gummyworm gasket** for the board -- yes, *you can gasket mount the KBD8X MKII!* Just by chance in design, though.  It works just like you expected.
* ~~An~~ **~~e-white KBDPAD MKII~~** ~~with an~~ **~~extra pink top~~**~~,~~ **~~built~~** ~~with Sakurios lubed with 205g0 and some plate-PCB and PCB-case foam.  The caps on this board are from GMK Minimal R1 and the GMK blanks GB --~~ **~~they are included in this bundle.~~**  ~~The pad itself has seldom been used, and the keycaps have no shine at all to it.~~ **SOLD separately.**
* The original box~~es~~ and packaging for ~~both~~ the Board ~~and the Pad~~.

One of the rubber feet of the board is starting to fall off, and while I do have replacements on hand right now (the one in the pictures), they aren't in the same height.  I think I've gotten some proper replicas of the feet in the mail, but that's not going to arrive anytime soon.  I believe the keyboard currently has VIA installed, but I'm not sure if that's truly the case -- just can't remember.  The foam isn't the KBD8X Muting Kit from KBDFans, but from a separate group buy.  **~~Asking $700 + Shipping~~** ~~for this bundle.~~ The bundle has been split -- **Asking $540 + Shipping** for the KBD8X MKII package.

&#x200B;

**Apple M0110 and M0120** \-- Good condition.  Both the board and the numpad is yellowed and unequally. (Check pictures for comparison of the two.)  The switches are Alps SKCC Tall Cream in good condition -- they don't bind and are fine to type on.  [Here's my typing test of it.](https://youtu.be/CTuhQ07Ahzo)  The board and the pad has been cleaned and **tested working**, but a converter isn't included.  This bundle also **includes two original cables** that are a tad dirty, but I don't want to stretch this thing and clean it.  The Caps Lock key is a lock switch, but I've also **included a NOS, never soldered SKCC Short Cream switch to replace the lock switch**, incase you want to use the lock key as a Control, *like it should be* (to some people, anyway).  **Asking $190 Shipped CONUS** for this bundle.

&#x200B;

**~~Alps SKCM Blue x60~~** ~~--  Pristine condition.  60 switches is enough to build a Tsangan/AEK layout 60% keyboard --~~ **~~enough for the upcoming Lunar II~~**~~.  These switches are ready to use.  I'm not the first owner if this batch, so I don't actually know the old condition of this item, but right now it's really darn good!  These are definitely one of the better Alps batches I've had my hands on.  I'd rate these switches an A -- a 9/10.  It's that good.~~  **~~Asking $100 Shipped CONUS~~**~~.~~ **SOLD for asking.**

TX65 | The board is Antique brass, switches are retooled MX blacks with 45g Singa Springs - lubed and switchfilmed. The weight has some minor scratches as well as a scratch on the plate. NOTE!!! The board has a problem being recognized by windows when connecting it. Previous owner claims not to have had this problem so it might be something with my computer. Either way you should assume that you'll have the same issue. The fix though is rather simple by just plugging the cable in again, you might need a few tries but when it's recognized it works flawlessly. Issue only reappears when unplugging the keyboard again, turning the computer on or off doesn't affect it. Maybe there's a fix completely, idk.  | 475€ + shipping (keycaps on picture not included)

* Stupidfish Foam laser cut foam installed front and back.  Bandaid modded and swapped in the factory lubed NK65 stabilizers (I put my Cherry Stabs in the NK65 board).
* Includes original USB cable, keycap puller and switch puller. Includes the original (67) Drop Black/Grey shine through keycaps.  Includes stock Gateron Blues (used/pre-owned but never soldered).
* Right now switches and keycaps are not installed. Pics show everything included.
* Board used maybe 12 hours total.  Removed the caps, switches and stabilizers to install the Stupidfish foam.  Then some of my new boards started arriving and this just has been sitting.  Also, I have another board on the way so just making room...  Kind of bummed to let it go but there is only so much space for boards.
* Ships Priority Mail with Tracking and Insurance.

**70x Tactile Frankenswitches (Lubed) -  $85 shipped**

* [Sound Test](https://imgur.com/a/6ZEqK0C)
* C3 Kiwi Stem + Zealio V2 Housing with 67g Gold Spring.  These are like new as the Zealios were purchased recently from KBDFans.  Mounted only a few in hotswap.
* These feel less tactile than the stock Kiwi and stock Zealio.  These feel more tactile than a Cherry MX Clear.  Slightly more tactile feel than an Outemu Silent Sky.
* *Lightly* lubed with Tribosys 3203 (stem sides, front and back - **NOT** the legs).  Springs oiled with 51004.  I lube my tactiles lightly to retain as much tactility as possible while only smoothing out the plastic on plastic contact.
* Ships First Class Mail with Tracking.

**KBD67 MKII Hotswap Foam - Backside only.**  $5 + shipping OR free with any purchase (let me know before invoice is sent)

* Made by Stupidfish.  But already had back foam.  This is for the back side only.  Will ship from 91105.  I can ship however you prefer.

BIG UPDATE, NEW PRICES.

Hello r/mechmarket,

About an hour ago I realized I needed to clean up and get rid of stuff that I am not using and don't plan on using. Let's start off with a few simple things:

Comment before PM, chat will be ignored, there is a link to pm me in the bot comment.

All prices are OR BEST OFFER (where BEST OFFER is BELOW ASKING PRICE), I really just need to move stuff. Shipping to CONUS only. Bundles are preferred and come with discounts!

Onward with the items.

**Acrylic Tofu - $100 shipped**

* pc plate included

**~~Cherry MX Reds - $20 shipped~~**

* ~~stock 5 pin, have been desoldered~~

**massdrop hangul pbt keycaps - $30 shipped**

* the kuro shiro keycap is not included, to make the hangul pbt set work the board needs to be configured in standard 6.25u ANSI layout

DESOLDERED THE TOFU AND SPLIT APART

**Wyse WY-30 Keycaps - 40 shipped (PENDING)**

* pulled from a board I desoldered, I have the rest of the board as well but I figured the keycaps would probably be the thing people might want, I have no idea what these are worth.
* The B key is the only keycap that had damage I saw when pulling it apart. included a picture of the scratch

**~~Gateron Ink (65ish) READ DESC - $55 shipped~~**

~~\* these were lubed (by me) with Tribosys 3204 and filmed with deskeys films and spring swapped with TX 65g springs (lubed with tx oil)~~ ~~\*~~ **~~They were soldered in a board, desoldered, and then resoldered, and then desoldered again. some of the switch tabs (clip into plate tabs) are bent inward but they pull out with a pair of tweezers. priced accordingly. Do not use these for a hotswap board.~~**

**~~Cherry switch parts - $30 shipped~~**

* ~~a lot of 3 pin housings, I used them for playing with UHMWPE in a 3 pin hotswap board. I do not know how many are there exactly but it's more than enough for 1 board~~
* ~~some 5 pin housings and mx reds (top bag) don't know exact number but not many in there trying to bundle together~~

**~~ThicThock MP 68g and 64g springs - $15 shipped~~**

Built with Creams lubed with 205g0 and Zeal Stabs Lubed with 205g0 on a brass plate. The board will come with an extra brass plate, an aluminum plate. a POM plate and a spare PCB.

The board is A stock and spotless.

[GLAMOUR SHOT OF THIS BEAUTIFUL KEYBOARD](https://i.imgur.com/UDcOTBe.jpg)

[TIMESTAMPS](https://imgur.com/a/gsZOyor)

**RAMA WORKS x Wilba.tech Thermal -  $1000 OBO** in the MIST color (silver) with the full layout and the hotswap PCB.  I did build it immediately after receiving it.  Currently it has Novelkeys Cream switches lubed with Krytox 205g0 and Equalz C3 Olivia edition stabilizers.  I did have to remove one switch during the build and it was quite the pain in the ass so it left a few marks on the silver plate around one switch and for that reason I'd rather sell it with the switches and stabs than remove them.

**GMK Mizu Base - $400** [PENDING SALE] this set was used probably a week total.  Saved it for this exact build (as you can probably tell) but at this point I'd rather buy 2 more PBT keycap sets that I'm not afraid to use daily.  Will include the GMK tray and box.

**GMK Mizu x Rama Artisan - $130 OBO** [PENDING SALE] this was actually never used at all.  Not sure what these typically go for so willing to take best offer or preferably add on with the base set or keyboard.

**Custom Finalmouse Air58 - $220 OBO** - again, not sure what this is actually worth, but never seen another one like it before.  Had the custom shell made by Space-Caps back in 2019 but by the time the shell had arrived I had moved to the smaller Cape-town mouse from them.  Also has a grey scale cable on it.



I'd prefer to bundle all this if possible, so if you're interested in it all shoot me a PM and we can try to work something out.  The Keycult x Rama artisan and ePBT Kuro shown in the pictures is not being sold."

I am looking to get rid of some things to free up space and money. US only on sales/trades. Comment before PM. The bot will put a nice little ""send a pm to this user"" link that you can use on mobile. all prices are ""or best offer"" (lower than asking).

I'll start with the Tofu

**Acrylic Tofu**

\- PC plate

\- Cherry Mx Reds (stock, 5 pin)

\- GMK Stabs (mixed clip in and screw in, lubed but still noisy since they were lubed by previous owner and I haven't touched them)

\- 1up RGB 60% USB C pcb (jumped on TAB key, been desoldered at least 4 times)

\- Massdrop Hangul PBT keycaps ([https://drop.com/buy/hangul-pbt-dye-subbed-keycaps-set](https://drop.com/buy/hangul-pbt-dye-subbed-keycaps-set)), I have the full set but with the split right shift the keycaps don't work (6.25u ANSI only), **THE KURO SHIRO CAP IS NOT INCLUDED**

it's a beater board, I used it to break in some switches and I didn't bother getting a hotswap pcb. I know this needs work to make usable but would be a good project for someone looking for one.

Asking $160 shipped w/ full keycap set

&#x200B;

for the artisans, the prices listed are retail (what I paid) plus shipping (to you). if it says ""trades"" I will prioritize trades. bundles are nice and save you some bucks.

Nightcaps/ETF Menloe - Harpy Echo - $90 shipped (this is less than retail)

For sale / trade is a black MGA standard with sneakbox pcb, black pom plate, h1s lubed with 205g0 and tx filmed, and lubed durock stabs, although I don't remember what with. Only flaws: 1. the board has is a small ding that came new with the board on the front of the bottom, only visible from the bottom, last picture has a close-up. 2. The left spacebar stabilizer conked out on me at some point and was replaced, and the replacement is less well lubed than the others.

* Absolutely no problems so far, only that there are 3 of screws missing, but you won't notice that

I feel bad as I don't have any usage for it now. Right now I am basically getting rid of my collection. I have been good at it (and the board on me) so I would be happy if it would found a good owner.

[Timestamps](https://imgur.com/a/q1BUoBf)

 I'm selling my Space65. Smoothest keyboard I've ever owned but it's rarely used due to my preference for tactile switches.

What's included:

\- Space65 R1 (Gray) with red badge and original packaging and accessories

\- Carbon fiber plate with Gateron Ink Blacks, lubed with Krytox 205G0

\- Tiffany C3 stabs (full kit), also lubed with Krytox 205G0

\- Second unused PCB (tested on 10/5)

\- GMK Red Samurai (full 65% set from [Drop.com](https://drop.com/)) **PENDING**

\- Red Samurai coiled aviator cable from Luxecables **PENDING**

Only blemish I can see is a tiny nick on the left side of the case near the Tab key (pictured). Otherwise it's in fantastic shape. Prefer to sell together as I don't have another keeb with the Red Samurai bottom row layout, but will consider separating them if I get interest for the keycaps and the aviator cable as a combo.

**Asking $675 shipped or $650 local (37221) for the keyboard and extra PCB.**

Sound test of KBD19x (w/ GMK WoB): [https://imgur.com/a/E68XTIm](https://imgur.com/a/E68XTIm)

~~For the Wyse ABS Doubleshot caps: They are very well used, nice and shiny, from 1991. The J key needs to be retrobrighted. I cleaned the caps with warm soapy water and let them dry for a good few days.~~ **~~Would like 15GBP + shipping. Can ship worldwide.~~**  **SOLD**

&#x200B;

~~For the~~ **~~KBD19x~~**~~: The board I got from KBDfans a month or two ago when I found that they were still in stock (at the time). I built the board initially with the~~ **~~alpacas (205g0 lubed, 0.15mm TX filmed)~~**~~, but the brass plate just wasn't doing it for me. I took a reciprocating saw (the dremel took too long to cut the brass) and~~ **~~DIY cut the plate into a half-plate~~**~~. The point of a half plate is to make the board feel softer, more flexy and improve the acoustics.~~

~~There are absolutely no blemishes or even scratches on the board as far as I can see, but there are a few marks on the plate from when I was dremelling. You can't notice it with keycaps on, and imo it doesn't even look that bad without them, since there is already a big contrast with the white PCB and the brass plate. Also note that F1-F10 have Gateron ink black switches, lubed 205g0 and TX filmed, 67g SPRiT springs.~~

~~This board has been successfully ported to VIA thanks to MechMerlin (where the hex file will be released with his kbd19x review, stay posted on his youtube channel for that), and the board sounds really amazing. Very nice and 'poppy', really good for a top mount board.~~

**~~THE ROUGH PRICES I PAID FOR EVERYTHING:~~**

~~Kit: 260GBP~~

~~Switches: 90GBP~~

~~Import Tax: 70GBP~~

~~TOTAL: 420GBP~~

Heya. Doing some housecleaning on the topre side of the collection. Also looking for any GMK sets in my wants list.

If you have any questions, feel free to PM.

**For Sale:**

Item | Price | Avail? | Notes
----|-----|-----| -----
Realforce 87U 10th Anniversary 55g | $330 shipped & insured | ✔️ | Used. Minor to moderate shine on WASD alphas. Shine on case near spacebar and arrow keys. No shine on OEM ABS spacebar; it was never used. Includes extras keys and red esc pictured in album. Original packaging is also included. This is the limited edition 87U with the gray/blue keycaps and gray (not black) Realforce case.
Idea23 HHKB HiPro caps | $50 shipped | ✔️ | These are some serious C-stock caps. They are unfortunately yellowed from sun damage, and when I removed the set for cleaning, the enter key and a black alpha snapped their stems. Left shift and enter already had a missing stem half; I will include the snapped ones in the picture for anybody who wants to attempt epoxying or gluing them to repair. Set will be given a good rinse before sale; otherwise sold as-is. Price is set low to reflect the condition, but fair offers will be entertained. Cardboard tray not included (it doesn't fit the caps when closed.)

* **Tada68 w/ Box Jades** \- **$150 + Shipping** \- Dark Grey Alu case, clipped/lubbed/band-aided GMK screw-in stabs. Does **not** come with keycaps. Also worth noting these Box Jades were purchased pre-retooling to correct stretching/cracking issues. I've had ePBT caps on them for about 2 years and haven't seen any signs of this happening but YMMV.
* **Mini-USB Pexon Cable** \- **$25 + Shipping** \- Uses 6-pin aviation style connector, blue + grey sleeving w/ black heat shrink. Pairs nicely w/ Tada :)
* **Drawstring Travel Cover - $5 + Shipping -** Came with a different board I purchased, have no use for the cover. Doesn't provide much in the way of protection other than from dirt/dust.
* **Filco SA Keycap Set - $50 + Shipping -** Double-shot ABS SA profile, 104-key set. Didn't see much use so not much shine to them.
* **~~B&W /~~** **Color Grab Bag** **- $10** **~~each, $15 together~~** **+ Shipping -** Random assortment of caps from a grab bag purchased off this sub a while ago. Good for filling up a macro pad / switch tester. **- Edit: B&W bag sold.**
* **Holtites - $10 + Shipping -** Bought with the intention of making the Tada hot-swap, couldn't get them to work for me. Enough to fill up a 65% board.
* **O-Rings - $5 + Shipping** **-** Have had these for a while and never liked the feel of them. Not super stiff.

The board is built with Tealios V2, lubed with Tribosys 3204, with lubed authentic GMK stabilizers. Split backspace. The extra propeitary PCB is included. The top and bottom piece have been cerakoted white, and the mid-piece is brass. Please note that white cerakote is prone to imperfections when looking closely, so this is not for those seeking absolute perfection in their metal boards, however I think it looks quite stunning with the brass mid-piece and the right keyset. The brass has also tarnished a bit, which is normal for brass and can be restored by you if you so choose. Does not come with original packaging. Bottom LEDs likely need to be replaced if you are interested in using them. Does NOT come with keycaps. Will be shipped securely with lots of padding.

**QXP** - SOLD

Built with Healios V2, DZ60 PCB, lubed with Tribosys 3204, with lubed authentic GMK stabilizers. Split backspace. Cerakoted gray. While not as prone to visible imperfections as the white, cerakote will have some imperfections compared to anodized aluminium. Does NOT come with keycaps. Does not come with original packaging.

The tofu comes with a gk64 hotswap pcb, cream switches that were lubed with krytox 204g0, an aluminum plate, mkultra case and plate foam, and lubed gmk stabilizers.

Mid Layer: frosted acrylic

Stretchy / Nice TRRS cable :)

Hello,

First up is an E-White NK65 V2. I used this board for around 13 days, it works perfectly and has no external flaws. There are a few very minor scratches on the plate from my switch puller, but they are covered once switches are placed into the board. It comes with the cable and carrying case it came with, too. The only thing I did to the board itself was take the stabs out and re-lube them since the factory lube was basically nonexistent. Asking $250 shipped CONUS

Second, a base set of GMK Analog Dreams and the novelties. The set was mounted and used lightly for around a month. No shine has formed on any of the caps either. Asking $235 shipped for base, $65 shipped for novelties, or $265 shipped for both, all CONUS. BOTH SETS SOLD

If you're a madlad and want both, I'll do $480 shipped CONUS.

Thanks!"

Hello! I am looking to sell a couple boards I have, as well as a set of GMK keycaps. All prices are OBO. Details in the table below:

Item | Info | Price
:--|:--:|--:
E-White KBD67 | Flawless E-white body, solder PCB build with BSUN Holy Pandas on an aluminum plate. Great board! I am switching to a hotswap build, however, as I have had the itch lately to try out a million different switches :-) | $500 OBO
Acrylic Tofu60 | Solder DZ60 PCB, built with Zealios v2 67g on a carbon fiber plate; 60% for factor isn't for me, I am realizing, so I am moving on from this build | $270 OBO
GMK Coral | Brand new! Never mounted, and only touched by me to adjust the few caps that jostled around during shipping; only opened to confirm contents and get a first-hand look at the colors of the set. Will ship with box and trays. | $260 OBO

Thems the goods! You'll also see a PC KBD67 in the top corner of the timestamp. If you are interested in the board but would prefer the PC case over the e-white, let me know and we can talk about that as well! Additionally, if you're interested in the GMK Peaches and Cream set currently on the board in the timestamps, let me know and we can talk about that as well. :)

Prices above don't include shipping, but I usually try to be reasonable in that regard, and I don't mind splitting high shipping costs with the buyer. PM me if you are interested! Thanks!"

The board I got from KBDfans a month or two ago when I found that they were still in stock (at the time). I built the board initially with the alpacas (205g0 lubed, 0.15mm TX filmed), but the brass plate just wasn't doing it for me. I took a reciprocating saw (the dremel took too long to cut the brass) and DIY cut the plate into a half-plate. The point of a half plate is to make the board feel softer, more flexy and improve the acoustics.

There are absolutely no blemishes or even scratches on the board as far as I can see, but there are a few marks on the plate from when I was dremelling. You can't notice it with keycaps on, and imo it doesn't even look that bad without them, since there is already a big contrast with the white PCB and the brass plate. Also note that F1-F10 have Gateron ink black switches, lubed 205g0 and TX filmed, 67g SPRiT springs.

This board has been successfully ported to VIA thanks to MechMerlin (where the hex file will be released with his kbd19x review, stay posted on his youtube channel for that), and the board sounds really amazing. Very nice and 'poppy', really good for a top mount board.

**THE ROUGH PRICES I PAID FOR EVERYTHING:**

Kit: 260GBP

Switches: 90GBP

Import Tax: 70GBP

TOTAL: 420GBP

 **I think that 420GBP + SHIPPING is very fair. I can ship worldwide.**

* Soldered In-Switch RGB Light (can be customized)

* Absolutely no problems so far, only that there are 3 of screws missing, but you won't notice that

I feel bad as I don't have any usage for it now. Right now I am basically getting rid of my collection. I have been good at it (and the board on me) so I would be happy if it would found a good owner.

I have a space gray aluminum badge version think6.5. The condition is very good and there are no scratches on the weight or the body of the case. It's a solder pcb and built with 67g zealios lubed with 3204. Lubed pink C3 stabs. Gold PVD Brass weight and badge. Lighting works on the PCB as well. Comes with original packaging. Let me know if you want more pictures or have any questions.

Looking for 800USD~ (if you think ^(ill be here all week guys) this price is bogus then just offer me something lower, I wont be offended), I prefer to ship within north america but I can ship elsewhere as well, just know that it probably costs a lot more. I am willing to take some trades + paypal depending on what you have so throw it my way.

I am looking to buy some Alice plates, like aluminum or brass ones or carbon fibre. Not looking for softer plates.

Also looking for some bright and flashy gmk sets as well as ramas. Nothing in particular so just offer me what you got and ill see if im interested.

Also looking for some more 65g lubed zealios but forgot to put it in the title lol :c"

**Polaris:**  After I found out that you couldn't use an aftermarket PCB on the Polaris I decided not to keep it because I'm mostly a hot-swap plebeian :/, but the Polaris is unpacked and unbuilt so essentially brand new; however apparently I didn't order a plate?? If you're interested in getting a plate for this board though there are listings for them on mechmarket every so often.

**GMK Dots:** I bought GMK Dots from Novelkeys during the GB. The set is pretty cool and definitely unique but I decided its just not for me. Since I was on the fence about the set I wore rubber gloves while using the set to prevent any shine lmao. Surprisingly typing on it with gloves felt fine but eventually my hands would start getting sweaty so overall not the best idea. After about 2 weeks of use I retrayed the set and its been there even since."

Hello everyone, I am downsizing a bit and looking to get rid of some stuff I don't use much anymore. As always, I am also looking to get some of my wants list. Feel free to reach out if you want additional pics of anything.

Prices are in USD and include shipping. I am located in the Bay Area and will offer better prices locally if we meet up on certain items. Priority goes to people I have dealt with in the past and local deals. I prefer to do US shipping, but not necessarily a deal breaker. I may have to adjust prices for shipping internationally.

So the other day I went to McDonald's to get my fix of chicken nuggets. It was peak lunchtime so it took me nearly 20 minutes to receive my order. To my surprise, my beloved curry sauce was not in the package; instead, staring at me was this oddly-coloured smoky cheese sauce (well actually it was the one-eyed Minion from Despicable Me on the packaging that was staring at me).Sorry for the rant, but I just wanna hop on the bandwagon of putting unrelated stories in r/mm posts. For what it's worth, this incident saddened me for a good 15 minutes or so. The cheese sauce turned out to be quite decent.

Shipping will be via express courier only to minimise complications given the current pandemic situation, with full insurance and tracking, 3-5 days delivery worldwide. \~25-30usd for keycaps, \~50-70usd for keyboards.

Happy Friday everybody,

Hope you're all still well and staying safe & healthy. I'm continuing my quest to finally let go of my keyboard inventory. I am local to Los Angeles and willing to drive to meet you closer in the middle but priority will go to people willing to meet in my area. **Priority for all deals goes like this: local bundles, shipped bundles, local items, shipped items.** Not FCFS, CONUS shipping only. Items are priced to favor local peeps, sorry everybody else. Comment before PM, messages without comment will be ignored, chats will be ignored too. Thanks for reading, have a great rest of your weekend!

Item | Notes | Price
:-- | :-- | :--
RAMA M65-A | Gray cerakote, Millmax (7305) PCB, no stabs included. I bought it off [this nice guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/itdkh0/usca_h_cerakote_m65a_moon_u80a_artisans_bumens/) two weeks ago and while it's a fingerprint magnet, it's beautiful. There's a slight issue with the cerakoting (pictured) but it's not noticeable when built. PCB was band aid modded by previous owner, though they're a little worn. **Does not come in OG box.** | ~~$650 local, $700 shipped~~ **Sold!**
Tofu65 | Burgundy case, DZ65RGB hotswap PCB, alu plate, clipped & lubed (either GMK or Cherry) stabs, will also throw in a layer of stupidfish foam. There are some loose sockets, notably backspace and one of the R1 buttons next to spacebar, but I don't have a solder or spare sockets. There's also a ding on one of the corners from the previous owner, though it isn't very noticeable on the table. Price reflects ding and PCB problems. Basically, you're buying the case and getting the rest as add-ons. | ~~$125 local, $150 shipped~~ **Sold!**
**Built** Klippe T | Ultramarine case, WT60-D, Mekanisk polished brass plate, Mekanisk foam between PCB and case **but not** between the plate and PCB. Built with 67g Tealios (R2) lubed with 205g0, teal C3 stabs, plate has some patina spots. Pains me to part with this beauty but it doesn't get enough run to warrant keeping it. Comes with another unused layer of Mekanisk foam. **Does not come with GMK WoB.** | ~~$250 local, $275 shipped~~ **Sold!**
**Unbuilt** Klippe T | Ultramarine case, DZ60RGB ANSI PCB, alu plate. I plugged this in recently and mysteriously, the PCB doesn't work for me. The LEDs will all work but I can't get it to flash via QMK. Don't have the time to tinker with it more. | ~~$180 local, $200 shipped~~ **Sold!**
Drop ALT | High profile case in black, MK Ultra foam, gold plated Cherry plate mount stabs (from Zeal) lubed, clipped & band aid modded by previous owner, will come with stock Skylight (slate/gray) keycaps. Case is still in great condition, no noticeable dings or scratches. O and R keys have trouble registering sometimes but nothing like the other PCB issues I've noted in the other boards. | $180 local, $200 shipped
Planck Rev 6 | Black high profile case, comes with plate and foam. This little guy is from OLKB, **not Drop**. Just couldn't get used to ortho, cute little board though. Notable scratches on the bottom pictured. | ~~$125 local, $140 shipped~~ **Sold!**
Vortex Core | Rebuilt with lubed vintage blacks, unsure what lube or batch of switches these are but this is a funny little sleeper board. Unfortunately, the left spacebar doesn't work, rendering it hard to use because I use my left thumb for space. Everything else (including layers) works perfectly though. Unsure if it's a PCB issue or if the switch just needs to be resoldered so a few bucks off to reflect this. | ~~$50 local, $60 shipped~~ **Sold!**
Cooler Master Masterkeys Pro S | Cherry MX Reds, everything stock, comes with PMK DSA Dolch. Still a great board if you have a friend or family member who wants a mechanical or a gaming board and is okay with stock MX switches (honestly, it doesn't sound that bad but the stabs, *shudders*). Not separating these because I'm a lazy fuck, sorry. Comes with stock keycaps too. | $100 local, $125 shipped
GMK WoB | Pictured mounted on the built Klippe T. [Additional pictures for shine check here](https://imgur.com/a/MLjhFiM), I don't think there's very much shine -- you have to look for it really, though maybe my lighting is just flattering. Local buyers get the tray regardless. | ~~$90 local, $100 shipped **in bags** or $115 shipped **in the tray**~~ **Sold!**"

Would like to trade my GMK Skidolcha for another GMK set. They're barely starting to shine, I think it's hard to see though looking at it from the top down. I'm open to hearing anything you've got, shine or no shine.

**DETAILS** (please read entirely before asking any questions)

* Kit has been lightly used as a secondary board for about a month. It's pretty much in perfect condition to my eye, but included pictures of differing angles in the album anyway. 

* I'm leaving the stabilizers on the PCB, cause I have no need for them. Any plastic on plastic contact points have been lubed with Krytox 205g0, along with a heavy application of dielectric grease on the wire.

* The board has been fitted with 0305 MillMax hotswap sockets (ANSI layout), which make it easy for any newcomer trying to get a feel for the type of switches they like best.

* One of the switch sockets for the ESC key on the DZ60 PCB is too small to fit a hotswap socket. I opted to add a Mill Max socket to the standard sized hole and soldered the second leg of the switch, as you normally would. I'll be leaving the switch soldered in for the sale just to make things easier. It is a Tealios V2 which has been lubed with Krytox 205g0 and filmed (Kebo). 

* I've flashed the board with VIA, because it's excellent when dealing with all the underglow light settings and also why not? 

* Pictures of the current layout, keytester, and a bunch of closeups are included in the album.

Good  evening. My GMK Ursa arrived today and whilst it looks good i find that  it is a bit to muted for my liking. Looking to either sell it for  around 230 euros or trade for another gmk set.

Not  to sure what shipping costs will be but chuck a dm and ill give you a  quote. Can ship in either bags or the tray. Not FCFS but rather what is easier for me will be priorotized. Not shipping outside of EU due to the current world situation."

Howdy.

* Doro67 - I bought this, built, off James of AKB and have recently de-soldered it and cleaned the PCB(again, shown in pictures). There are flaws/damage on the board but they are mostly internal and would not been seen in use when built. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/SBhsnvK) is an album on the board and the asking price is **$280/£220**

~~GMK Metropolis Base - [This](https://i.imgur.com/AfPKWe0.jpg) set hasn't seen a great deal of use and, though is a interesting set, happens to get swapped out eventually. It hasn't shined as of yet and is just the base kit. Asking price is **£185/$240**~~**Sold**

~~GMK Calm Depths Assembly and Space Bar Kit - Bought [this](https://i.imgur.com/AfPKWe0.jpg) on the off change I use some otho/splergo board... never did. No shine and I haven't used it at all. Will not ship in it's tray. Asking price for both kits is **£140/$180**~~**Sold**

* [Maxkeys SA Pink & White](https://i.imgur.com/ME4WHWs.jpg) - I've had this set for ages and only ever used it for a few weeks on a build. It's still avail on [kbdfans](https://kbdfans.com/products/bfcmmaxkey-pink-white-sa-profile-keycaps-set). Asking price is **£50/$65**

* [Zealios](https://i.imgur.com/sBSx4oT.jpg) x103 - 60 of these are lubed with 3203 (lube well imo) and the rest are not. Their 4th and 5th legs have been clipped off (bought them this way). Asking price is **£80/$100**

* [Koalas](https://i.imgur.com/TVR9ysq.jpg) x 85 - These switches have been used in a board for the last 6 months and are getting replaced due to wanting a different tactile switch. They have been lubed with 3204 on just the rails, I'm happy with the lube job on these. Asking price is **£55/$70**

~~[Gateron Yellows](https://i.imgur.com/TAAZgEm.jpg) x 72 (60 lubed, 12 unlubed) - These are transparent topped / black bottom Yellows (KS-8). They have been in and out of a couple boards. They have been lubed with 3203 a months back and retain the stock spring. Asking price is **£25/$32.**~~**Sold**


Bundles will be given discounts and priority.

Looking to sell the following:

\- GMK Vaporwave ($450 + Shipping) - used very sparingly, approximately 3-4 days tops. I find myself worrying about the caps going to shine.  So I'd rather use PBT and be done with it.

\- Everglide Dark Jades lubed (SOLD locally) - tactiles are not for me.  Used for 2 days and removed right away due to preference on using linears instead. 70 pcs.

\- \*OPTION KBD67v2 MKII E-White (will sell after selling the Vaporwaves or if I get a Canoe or Space65) - Brass plate and weight, will include NK Creams (unlubed) 70 pcs.
