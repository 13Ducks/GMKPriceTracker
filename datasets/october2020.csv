Leopold FC660M - ~~$110~~ $85 USD + Shipping

First off, this board is practically in new condition. I just purchased this to use it for class while I didn't have a keyboard, and afterwards put the dust cover back on it and let it sit in my closet for a little while. It has been dusted using my high pressure air compressor, and looks basically brand new. Original packaging and all included. Tthis particular FC660M contains Cherry MX Reds, with no modifications to the board whatsoever.

Nightfox - ~~$150~~ $125 + Shipping

This particular Nightfox has Cherry MX Silent Black switches, lubed with Tribosys 3204, Dampening foam, Zeal stabs lubed with Keytox 205g0 for the shift, backspace, and enter, and a screw-in GMK stab for the spacebar lubed with Krytox 205g0, and band-aid modded. Very silent, very smooth, very bassy. This board has a slight issue with the R key, as it sometimes won't register a keypress, but pressing hard on the key seems to fix this problem for a long time. (Weeks.) So it's not a big issue at all, but I wanted to make sure you were aware. I think a simple desolder/resolder would make this switch work perfectly, but I'm blind so I can't solder/desolder out of concern for my safety.

DSA High Contrast Granite - ~~$120~~ $110 + Shipping

This is my favorite keycap set, and I'm so sad that it doesn't work with my new keyboard, but it's the full DSA High Contrast set. Absolutely love it, and I'm sure you will as well.

DSA Granite Text Modifiers - ~~$40~~ $30 + Shipping

Text modifiers from the DSA Granite set. Comes with a lot of extra keys as well aside from just the modifiers, as Signature Plastics sent these to me as a gift for some inconvenience we had, but now that I'm selling my main DSA set, I have no use for them, as I've converted to Cherry profile.

Hello clackers!

Made some nice cables to perfectly match the sets mentioned above and maybe some other sets because why not!

Every cable has been reversed coiled and heated 4 times to ensure a nice durable coil, all cables have also been tested to ensure you won’t get a defective/non fuctional cable! 

(Cables are wired following zaps diagram)

Every cable has 6” coil (expect darling which has 5”), 5ft detachable end, double sleeve, powder coated aviator (white is textured and crimson red is glossy), usb C to usb A...

You’ll also get a “respect the coil” sticker featuring Mr. coil! nwn

**UPDATE**: all the kits except the Pata Negra are sold. For now, I m planning to keep the Pata Negra kit myself. Thank you all for your interst.

&#x200B;

Happy Halloween everyone,

I m selling the following items-

*GMK Jamon*Included kits:a) **Core** kit aka Base kitb) **Numpad** kitc) **Spacebar** kitd) **Jamonelties** kit aka noveltiese) **Pata Negra** kit aka accent(?) kit

**All the kits** are brand **new** in box and **sealed**.

*Price*:

**Bundle A** (Core kit + Numpad kit+ Spacebar kit+ Jamonelties + Pata Negra) =  $530 + shipping in CONUS

Note that the asking price for all the kits included covers what I paid for these items. I just want to get back what I paid. I tried to price the bundles in such a way that, the bigger the bundle you get, the more discount you can get. So here are the smaller bundles pricing-

**Bundle B** (Core kit + Spacebar kit+ Jamonelties + Pata Negra) =  $499 + shipping in CONUS

**Bundle C** (Core kit + Spacebar kit+ Jamonelties ) =  $465 + shipping in CONUS

**Bundle D** (Core kit + Spacebar kit + Pata Negra) =  $425 + shipping in CONUS

**Bundle E** (Core kit + Spacebar kit ) =  $375 + shipping in CONUS

All these are discounted bundle prices. After a bundle with Core/Base kit is sold, I m open to selling any of the remaining kits.  A single kit will cost more than what it is priced in a bundle.

&#x200B;

**Please also read** below:

All the prices **include Paypal fees** and are **OBO(here OBO means or best offer, no bidding please)\_**.

All items are for sale in **CONUS** only.

Some other things to note-

a. No chat, **Direct message** only. Please **Comment before** PM

c. Feel free to **ask questions** in messages.

d. It is **not FCFS, Bundles preferred**

e. Response to messages can be delayed but I promise to reply to everyone asap.

f. If it is already the item will be marked as **\[SOLD\]**

Anyways, prefer to sell all cafe together, the base is the only item opened here, everything else is sealed. Strong preference to local fast sale.  Currently unwilling to ship international (sorry :( )

Hey everyone,

I have some nice stuff to sell; It's all first-hand stuff that I enjoyed using at some point, but as I'm progressively refining my keyboard tastes, some of those don't see much use anymore. 

All prices are in **euros**, **exclude** shipping fees, and **include** PayPal fees. EU buyers will be **prioritised**. 

I'll try to send everything as soon as I can, however things might take some time to get to you due to my country getting back into a lockdown.

First before I go into the board I WILL NOT SPLIT THESE UP. I figured this would be the most effective way for me to get rid of both at the same time and at what I think is a great price! Reason for selling is I want to save for a more ""high end"" board and because I was able to snag a GMK set for a an amazing price from another user! (:

I got the Tofu case from another user from a trade I traded an ID80 for his black tofu with brass plate, GMK screw in stabs, foam for case, and dz60rgb\_ANSI. At the time I believe his asking price was $200 shipped CONUS. There will be parts of the board that have the anodization or paint missing I tried to picture it as best as I can. But as a warning this is a used board so there maybe some parts that have paint/ anodization missing. as stated above I tried my best to picture it.

Included with the board will be GMK First Love THERE IS SHINE MAINLY ON THE GAMER KEYS. So WASD and surrounding keys. I tried to picture it the shine isn't heavy because some of the keys still have a bit of that texture on it? If you've used GMK sets you should know what I mean! I originally bought this brand new sealed maybe 2-3 months during the start of quarantine for around $250 (Could be more but this price seems accurate.)  As per usual I don't really sell anything for a profit and am just looking for what I paid for (if it's still like new condition) and if it's used than less than what I paid for but still a reasonable price! I've seen like new or used once or twice sets go for around $210- 240ish. The only keys I've mounted are the keys you see here and the Function keys which are bagged. All other keys including the 7U and others will be shipped in a bag.

So the black tofu has the dz60RGB\_ANSI hotswap edition PCB, GMK lubed screw in stabs, foam for the case, and lubed and filmed (lubed with krytox 205g0 and deskeys gasket switch films) board sounds very thocky and pleasant! And for the keycap sets it's being considered used with shine! Since I don't want anyone to purchase this thinking that there's no shine on the keycaps!

My asking price is 320 SHIPPED VIA CONUS. As stated above I am not splitting these and am hoping that this goes to someone who will actually want a board to use. If you do decide to sell them when receiving that's on you and not much I could do lol. CONUS ONLY PLS, Comment first before PM. Thank you! Enjoy your night! And as I've stated since I don't want any miscommunications when purchasing you're purchasing a USED GMK set that will have shine and also a Used Tofu that will have some marks but nothing that will affect the board!

The keyboards in the timestamp are sold without keycaps.

[TGR A17 replica](https://imgur.com/a/XFzDd4T): bought from r/mm a couple of months ago, but was unfortunately [damaged](https://i.imgur.com/udzJTFD.jpg) in shipping (see pics); it is just a hairline crack on the top acrylic layer, but it does not affect the functionality whatsoever. Built on a black h87a (mini USB) with lubed Gateron Milky Blacks; types like a dream. Got a new main TKL so this is just gathering dust.  Can provide sound test upon request. $260 shipped, but can include coiled, grey mini USB aviator for an additional $40.

**Brutal60 (proto) +Instant60 PCB**: bought from local seller in July. Haven't been using this board lately so I might as well sell it; comes on a polycarb plate, baby blue C3 stabs, and shelf liner in the bottom part of the case. No visible flaws. Is not compatible with modern brutal60 parts due to it having different plate mounting points. Asking for $300 shipped, but can leave the NK Silk yellows (spring-swapped to Sprit 68g Heavy; uniformly re-applied with 205g0) for an additional $60.

**~~GMK Olivia++ with Spacebars Kit~~**~~: NIB sealed, and not willing to split. Wanted to gift to my sister, but went with giving Peach Blossom instead. $310 shipped.~~   **Sold for $300 shipped**

**ePBT Kuroshiro R2 (base+JP mods)**: Was part of the GB: mounted for pics, and used in a typing test. Took it off because I do not like the feel of ePBT when compared to ABS caps like GMK. $240 shipped

**~~SA Bliss Base:~~** ~~I wanted to like this, but uniform R3 was not my cup of tea. Used extremely lightly, about 2 hours max. $220 shipped~~ **Sold for asking**

Hi mechmarket, I've returned again, this time with quite a nice keeb to sell/trade, and also the GMK Cafe and Spacebars from before.

CONUS only, please

**ai03 Polaris**

New, sealed (box opened to take pictures, but everything inside remains sealed)

\-Grey WK version

\-Brass weight (Gold color)

\-FR4 full plate (it's black and does not look like brass or PC, so I came to this conclusion)

Comes with all the accessories that came with it.

~~Asking $666 + shipping~~ SOLD

Or

Trades for mid- to high-end 65% (non-PC) keebs, preferences and notes listed below

Got this in today and it was a whole lot prettier than I had imagined. I kind of don't want to sell it that much now that I've seen it in person, but I'm posting it here if someone really wants it and I can use this money towards something that suits me even better since I'm more of a 65% guy (65% > 60%, literally), but I wouldn't mind keeping this beauty at all :)

**GMK Cafe Base and Spacebar Kit**

New, sealed

I thought I had secured a local buyer from my last post, but I haven't heard back for over a day (please message back, man), so I'm posting this bundle here since I got the Polaris today.

~~Asking $379 shipped CONUS~~ SOLD

Or

Trades for mid- to high-end 65% (non-PC) keebs, preferences and notes listed below

Oh, I forgot to include the Alpaca switches:

**75x Alpaca Switches (stock)**

The timestamp picture shows a bag of 150 Alpacas, but I'm only selling 75 of them because the rest is for personal use and I got some Tangerines yesterday.

~~Asking $51 + shipping~~ SOLD

I know that they are still in stock at PrimeKB, but this price is not really extravagant and I probably ship a lot faster than PrimeKB (no offense intended, great store).

For trades:

I'll add PayPal if necessary, but keep in mind that I'm not rich and don't want to blow over $1k (total, along with the Polaris and/or GMK Cafe bundle) on a keeb.

Boards I'm most interested in (many over $1k market price, but I want to try nonetheless because they're such nice keebs):

\-Iron165

\-Chimera

\-Constellation (failed to get one last friday because of the chaos)

\-Key65 (preferrably with logo blocker)

If you have any questions, please feel free to PM me

Yo!

Moving on from the colorway that brought me into this crazy hobby. Letting go of most of my precious Miami Nights artisans. Below are some details and prices. These are either what I paid or less. In some cases by a lot haha.

&#x200B;

Here's what I have. All caps are MX.

* **Navacaps Miami Nights Taka Collection - $240**
   * Only split I'll consider is if you buy everything except the pink striped one. Might keep that one.
* **SUK Keybuto III ""Toda La Noche"" Collection - $250**
   * Not splitting.
   * A commission from SUK. Comes with certificate he made.
* **ETF Facial Miami Blanks - $50 each**
   * If you buy one at double the price you get the other one **free**!
* **MitchCapped pink on black gamer set - $100**
   * Not splitting, of course.
* **MitchCapped Miami Nights gamer set - $100**
   * Also not splitting, of course. These are cyan on top with pink splotches on sides.

&#x200B;

As for what I'm after (besides money).

* **GMK Minimal** (or other GMK CP on WS1 sets; maybe GMK Hennessey)
   * Will take the whole set but I actually just want some mods and a few other keys from this. So if you want to sell/trade that let me know.
* **GMK WoB** (or other GMK WS1 on CP sets)
   * Again, whole set or mods/extras.
* **Southpaw Extended 65** (Silver or cerakoted white)
   * Just case is fine.
* If by chance someone here has guitar pedals they want to trade I'm down for that. Strymon Big Sky/Timeline, Line 6 DL4, TC Flashback 2.

&#x200B;

Shipping will be $7 for each purchase if CONUS. More if international. Down for local OC swap at Bottle Logic, Modern Times or Bruery. Please comment before [PMing me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Kozahtli).

And just for fun [here are the caps I'll never sell/trade](https://imgur.com/a/8clHCyW). C=

**Solder U80 Milk**

also included: original silver weight, original silver plate, extra pcb, gray mute dampener

Condition:   Built the board, realized it was too big for me and never used it  again. There is a small manufacturing defect on the back of the board  near the usb-c port. It is shown in the timestamp. Other than that, the  board is pristine. Theres an extra plate/pcb/mute combo to for a new  kit.

**Built Lilac Savage65 and extra mill-maxed pcb -** This has been used. The pcb shown in the case was built with the 7u plate, novelkey creams lubed with 3204, and cherry stabilizers. The second pcb has been mill-maxed with 0305 sockets (currently setup for split backspace, but I can change sockets to full backspace if you would  like). The second pcb has the millmax sockets for the 6.25u plate, does   not come with stabilizers, and has been used. ***Not looking for trades on this currently***.

Hello! Selling some stuff to make way for PC upgrades. Everything is OBO, and I hopefully think priced fairly. Things will not be FCFS, but to people I know won't just flip the caps/ board. Comment PM b4 pming!
KBD8XMkii - Polycarb WKL, built with Gateron milk blacks on a fr4 plate, milk top black bottom. Lubed with 205g0, Spring swapped to 70g tx springs (14mm), and filmed with Deskeys film. Brass weight, and missing a screw. Board is very well kept, no scratches on usb port / back. 0 signs of yellowing, brass weight has machining marks (that's p normal). Only one small scuff, will send picture if interested. $550 shipped.

~~GMK Olivia + Spacebars - Never mounted, only opened to check caps for any warpage. Keys are all good! Packaging got slightly damaged in transit unfortunately. Looks a bit smooshed, but caps are pristine. PM if you want more pics. Both kits for $290 shipped, bundle w/ kbd8x for $825 shipped.~~ SOLD TO u/elliotheressa_325

~~GMK Mizu Base - Man, this hasn't been listed on mechmarket in a fat while, huh? I know I'm probably gonna get a SHITTON of dms in the next 5 minutes. We'll do this: first person to guess what my favorite league character is, gets first priority on the caps. (Assuming you're not a flipper, new account, etc etc lol). Selling for $235 shipped in bags. Caps are in grear condition, they were mounted for the first time recently on the kbd8x and used for barely a month. Literally bought them together just for that reason. Now I'm kinda not vibing with it, and prefer monochrome sets. Can also bundle with the kbd8x, shipped as it looks, for $800.~~ SOLD TO u/Soraikuuuu for Asking!

HHKB P2 - Honestly don't know what to do with this. Bought it to work on as a project, don't use it anymore. Kinda sits there, menacingly, repeatedly yelling me to mod it. Please, someone help a pour soul, and take it off my hands. Modded w/ JTK MX sliders + stabs, lubed w/ 205g0. Comes with original caps and sliders. No original packaging. $150 shipped.

Lastly, this damn Senna statue. I hate senna as a champ with all my heart. Dumbest ADC ever made. If you want it, it's free, but I'll judge you. From the league mini set for True DMG.

Bundles get priority! Once again, comment PM b4 pming.

here's a hint btw on my fave champ on league, it's part of the true dmg lineup. :>","[US-CA] [H] KBD8XMkii PC WKL TKL, GMK Olivia Light base + Spacebars, GMK Mizu Base, HHKB Pro 2 + accessories [W] PayPal, Trades"

Leopold FC660M - ~~$110~~ $85 USD + Shipping

First off, this board is practically in new condition. I just purchased this to use it for class while I didn't have a keyboard, and afterwards put the dust cover back on it and let it sit in my closet for a little while. It has been dusted using my high pressure air compressor, and looks basically brand new. Original packaging and all included. Tthis particular FC660M contains Cherry MX Reds, with no modifications to the board whatsoever.

Nightfox - ~~$150~~ $125 + Shipping

This particular Nightfox has Cherry MX Silent Black switches, lubed with Tribosys 3204, Dampening foam, Zeal stabs lubed with Keytox 205g0 for the shift, backspace, and enter, and a screw-in GMK stab for the spacebar lubed with Krytox 205g0, and band-aid modded. Very silent, very smooth, very bassy. This board has a slight issue with the R key, as it sometimes won't register a keypress, but pressing hard on the key seems to fix this problem for a long time. (Weeks.) So it's not a big issue at all, but I wanted to make sure you were aware. I think a simple desolder/resolder would make this switch work perfectly, but I'm blind so I can't solder/desolder out of concern for my safety.

DSA High Contrast Granite - ~~$120~~ $110 + Shipping

This is my favorite keycap set, and I'm so sad that it doesn't work with my new keyboard, but it's the full DSA High Contrast set. Absolutely love it, and I'm sure you will as well.

DSA Granite Text Modifiers - ~~$40~~ $30 + Shipping

Text modifiers from the DSA Granite set. Comes with a lot of extra keys as well aside from just the modifiers, as Signature Plastics sent these to me as a gift for some inconvenience we had, but now that I'm selling my main DSA set, I have no use for them, as I've converted to Cherry profile.

Hello!

Bought this circa-2017 Ergodox EZ off /r/mechmarket, and used it roughly for 1 year before switching to something smaller. Basic model (no backlight/RBG), with wristpads and tenting kit, and USB + TRRS cable. Unfortunately, I lost some of the original blank keycaps, so I've replaced them with some loose GMK Carbons I had around (as seen in the pic).

~~Asking for $150 + shipping costs, since it's older + missing some key caps.~~

TX65 | The board is Antique brass, switches are retooled MX blacks with 45g Singa Springs - lubed and switchfilmed. The weight has some minor scratches as well as a scratch on the plate. NOTE!!! The board has a problem being recognized by windows when connecting it. Previous owner claims not to have had this problem so it might be something with my computer. Either way you should assume that you'll have the same issue. The fix though is rather simple by just plugging the cable in again, you might need a few tries but when it's recognized it works flawlessly. Issue only reappears when unplugging the keyboard again, turning the computer on or off doesn't affect it. Maybe there's a fix completely, idk.  | 450€ + shipping (keycaps on picture not included)

Hello everyone!

Dove into this hobby too fast. 

Comment before PM, no chat and chats will be ignored. Will answer PM's in the order received. 

All prices include shipping and fees. CONUS only. Priority to local 94580 and bundles.

**~~Kumo Minivan Bundle - $276 (price is firm and not looking to split)~~** **SOLD**

**~~Kumo Minivan~~** \- USB-C, VIA compatible, Kailh hotswap sockets. Will come with PCB board, case, stock caps, USB-C cable, and holster/case. Selling it because I quickly realized it’s not for me although it felt nice to type on.

**~~GMK 80’s Kid~~** \- This is the full kit and includes the extra mods, caps and Road Kit. All caps were barely used and are in excellent condition with absolutely no shine.

~~\*\*\*Optional upgrade.~~ This set does not come with any keyswitchs. In the pictures, I have C3 x TKC Banana Splits lubed with Krytox 205 and Deskey film. If you would like for me to include them, I can for an additional $45. Just let me know.

**Melgeek Mojo60 built - $400 (price is firm and not looking to split)**

Mojo60 Black Aluminum 60% case. Great condition. No scratches or chips on the exterior. The interior also in great condition with the exception of the mounts where the paint has chipped. I use PCB O-rings to protect the PCB and has worked without issue. This case is heavy. Also has a foam cutout that sits nice and snug. Compared to the NK65 E-white alum I had; this build is really quiet. I really don’t want to sell this build but I have to. 

DZ60RGB V2 ANSI Hotswap – Band-aid mod, Zugear (Durock) transparent Gold Plated stabs lubed with Krytox 205, PCB mounted with PCB O-rings to the case.

MG Ember Keycaps – only the ANSI set seen in the pictures. Includes matching grey spacebar and bee keycaps seen in pictures.

Gateron Browns lubed with Krytox 205.

\*\*\*Optional Keyswitch upgrade – I can switch out the Gaterons for Novelkeys Creams lubed with Krytox 105 and Deskeys film. An upgrade is an additional $60. If choosing the upgrade option, the Gateron browns will not be included in the bundle. 

The bundle also includes the matching Melgeek Keyboard case. 

**Keycaps**

**CMY Kit – DSA Profile -** **~~$20~~** **$17–** New, not opened, shipped in bags as seen in pictures. This was purchased off AliExpress. 

**DSA PBT Dye-Sub 30 Keys -** **~~$20~~** $17 – From KBDFans, mounted to see how it looks, silly me as I got the wrong profile. Mounted for less than a couple of minutes. Shipped in a box as pictured. Was originally purchased directly from KBDfan.

**~~HyperX Pudding Keycaps set – Black set and White set– $20 for both, sold together~~** **SOLD.** Used for 1 month. Great condition. Shipped in bags.

Thanks for looking.","[US-CA][H] Kumo Minivan w/ GMK 80’s kid and stock keycaps, Melgeek Mojo60 Black Alum build, CMY Kits, HyperX Pudding Black and White set [W]PayPal"

Times are hard for me right now, need money for bills. The Bauer is by far my favorite board that I own, I really don't want to get rid of it but I need to in order to cover all the cost of bills. If I could I would keep the bauer, it is by far the best typing experience I've ever owned. Maybe one day I'll be able to either get this one back or get another. :(

The GMK sets i'm interested in are dualshot, ascii, and fuyu.  Also looking for JTK arctic!

 

The board was 450 shipped to me from China about a year ago, and the switches cost me $100 - so the way it's priced right now is less than what I paid for it.  I want to make my reasoning for selling at a loss clear though: it's not because I don't think the board is nice - on the contrary, it's a super nice and is a very unique keyboard (the arrow cluster is really cool I think).  I simply have too many boards coming in over the next few months and I want to both send this to someone who will use it and use the money from this sale to pay down some of the things I've got on the way!

Shipping rates:

• I’ll have to use an expensive expedited service, since the cheaper national carrier has been [rekt by Covid.](https://pos.com.my/journal/sed-ut-perspiciatis-unde-omnis-iste-natus-error-sit-voluptatem-accusantium-doloremque-4.html)

• For reference, shipping to CONUS would cost $55.

• Shipping price is the same ($55) for 1 or 2 sets due to the combined weight being below the minimum threshold, so please buy more than 1 item ;)

• PM me if you need a quote to another country.

• Import taxes / duties are your responsibility.

via DHL air in HK. There is gonna be a $5-7 surcharge on shipping to other parts of the world. Remote charge might occur depending on your address so please pm it to me to check. Feel free to msg me about shipping in Asia because there might be discount from the courier.

The typical timeframe is 1-2 weeks, including domestic shipping to the proxy, their processing time in HK (3 days usually), time that cargos waiting for pick-up at bay and the time on flight to the destinations. It is pretty reliable since COVID-19. [Here's some DHL tracking after they pick up the package.](https://imgur.com/a/czxgagT)

|Matrix Abel+|Teal color, built with Thic Thock Marshmallows, Lubed, clipped and modded GMK Screw in stabs. Flawless condition, but has a small quirk with keymapping as many Matrix PCBS do. (L) Alt and (L) Windows keys position appear to be swapped. From what I've read the Abel+ PCB cannot be remapped, but I didn't invest a lot of time trying to figure it out. This will be a non issue for some and a deal breaker for others but wanted to make sure I put it out there. Shipped in original packaging. Keycaps not included|$675 / Trades|

~~CannonKeys Navy Savage65~~ | ~~From the last drop. A-stock with flawless condition on the exterior.

PCB is millmaxed with 0305 sockets and the FR4 plate is the 6.25u spacebar variant.

Welcome to Donut's ""Oh fuck I'm the only one in the house with a job right now"" offloading of stuff round 1. Prices are based on what I could find info on, but also OBO, so hit me with offers cause I'm trying to be flexible. Shipping for artisans is $4/CONUS for singles, calculated by location for multiples.

Krytone Sheep - Bundle only, $450 - Krytone's old Topre stem that fits on most MX stems as well. I'm super fond of these caps and I've been super hesitant to let this group collection go, but artisans don't pay the water bill.  

Krytone Chickeys - $35/ea - Some are Krytone's aforementioned Topre/MX stems, some are MX only, as labeled in the timestamps. Part of my overall Krytone-centric collection. 

Krytone D'mons - $35/ea - All MX only. More Krytone stuff I've been holding onto for years now, including one I stopped in the middle of a 4hr drive home from uni to nab. Gold SOLD.

SUK Snapper ""Roastmallow""  - $80 - MX stem. My first artisan raffle win I've held onto almost four years now.

Crimson Cadet - $300 shipped insured conus OBO - Base kit, opened but never taken out of the trays. I had full intentions to do an entire themed build with this set until 2020 hit full stride.

First off, this board is practically in new condition.

It has been dusted using my high pressure air compressor, and looks basically brand new. Original packaging and all included. Tthis particular FC660M contains Cherry MX Reds, with no modifications to the board whatsoever. Here's a picture.

This one was a personal favorite of mine. It's a Nightfox build that I purchased from someone here on /r/mechmarket. It was the first custom that really got me into this hobby, and the first one that I bought off of /r/mechmarket. It is packing silent mx reds lubed with tribosys 3204, has everglide stabilizers for shift, backspace, and enter, and a GMK screw-in for the spacebar. The spacebar is also band-aid modded, and all stabilizers are lubed with krytox 205g0 and dialectric grease. For full transparency about this particualr board-- the R key has been acting up. I'm blind, so I can't desolder due to the fear of harming myself, so I haven't been able to desolder and resolder it. But it does work. It works perfectly fine, it just has moments where it has a little issues, but presing hard on the key will fix it for a while again. Again, not sure what's goign on there, but figured if you're buying, you should know everything about these boards. I can't tell you how annoying it is to buy boards from here, only to find that they have issues the seller didn't alert you to. So there you go (: Here's a picture of this beauty.

DSA High Contrast Granite - $120 (Not including shipping, but I'll be shipping via flat-rate, so price of shipping will be pretty low.)

So for starters, these are my current favorite keycap set, and I'm sad to see them go, but they need a new home. I need some cash to fund a new build, and these keys don't workw ell with my current board, so it's time for them to go to another board out there. So this comes with the Common, and Icon Modifiers from PimpMyKeyboard for the DSA High Contrast Granite keycap set. Absolutely love these, sad to see them go, but happy someone else will have these on their board. (: Here's a picture.

DSA Granite Text Modifiers - $41 (Not including shipping, but I'll be shipping via flat-rate, so price of shipping will be pretty low.)

This is just the text modifier set, as well as a couple other keys that I'll throw in for free. Not a full set, but a god couple keys. In great condition, pretty much never used. I was sent these by Signature Plasitcs while they were testing out one of my boards to see if their caps didn't work well with their sets, and they said that I could keep these keys, so personally I don't really like them super duper much. So here's a picture:

hi mechmarket, I'm back again to sell/trade

This time, I have:

**GMK Cafe Base + Spacebar Kit (really would like to sell them together)**

New, sealed

~~Asking $379 + shipping CONUS (can go a little lower if local to Orange County)~~ SOLD

Or

Trades towards mid- to high-end 65% (non-PC) keebs with PayPal on my end

Keebs over $1k are definitely over my budget (already spent too much this month), but I would really like a Chimera (man, that thing looks so beautiful)

Feel free to PM me if you have any questions

**Note**:

Starting this morning, there has been a pretty severe fire going on in my city, and last I checked, it's still 0% contained (7200 acres burned so far). As such, I may not be able to drop off packages at USPS within 1 business day, though I will do so as soon as it is safe to go out. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Thank you and have a great day :)","[US-CA][H]GMK Cafe Base + Spacebars, PayPal [W]PayPal, 65% Keeb Trades"

Hello! Back again looking to sell a few items. They're listed below:

* **Acrylic Tofu60 w/ 67g Zealios v2**
This board is built on a carbon fiber plate and the layout is 60% with arrow keys. Case is in like-new condition. Underglow looks great. *Asking $200+shipping*

* **80x Silent Alpacas, Stock**
Never used. Purchased from a user on MM as an add-on to another purchase and I already have a set, so I don't need these. *Asking $80+shipping*

* **90x NK Creams, lubed and filmed**
These switches are lubed with krytox 205g0 and filmed with clear kebo films. Love Creams, I just have too many switches right now and would rather use my resources for something else. *Asking $75 shipped*

* **GMK Dualshot, sealed**
Sealed set! Base set only. *Asking $300 shipped*

* **GMK Fro.yo**
This set has been opened and mounted with about 1.5-2 weeks' use. No sign of wear or shine whatsoever. Full base set. *Asking $225 shipped*

* **GMK Peaches and Cream**
This set is opened and has about 3 weeks of use on a secondary board. No shine. Full base set including novelty modifiers and arrow keys (these were part of the base set for this GB, but it's uncommon enough that it's worth mentioning I suppose). *Asking $300 shipped*

As always, prices are negotiable! If you are interested in something but think my asking price is unreasonable, let me know and I'll be happy to talk it out with you.

**Novatouch Bundle:** All the stuff I bought for this novatouch is going in here. This bundle contains: 

* Novatouch w/ BKE lights, silenced with hypersphere rings, lubed with EK mechlube 2, stabilizers greased; BKE lights are a mixture of old and new (old from the very first round on the alpha block, newer ones everywhere else, the older ones will be heavier than the newer ones)

* Original 45g domes (cut up to fit a realforce r1, but still perfectly working) and an extra set of conical springs

* Hasu USB-USB converter

* Extra case, plate, pcb (case has some scuffs, plate has no stab housings, pcb has non-working ESC key)

* Original packaging, cable, and set of rubber pads which act as o-rings (works well with cherry profile and shorter keycaps)

**Looking to get $400 shipped for the entire bundle**

~~**MX Silent Ink:** I have a total of 120x MX silent gateron ink switches, with these having the stems from cherry silent reds inside gateron ink v2 housings. They have all been lubed with krytox 205g0 on the slider rails, and the fronts and backs of the stem, and filmed. Springs installed in the switches have been oiled with victorinox oil. The configuration for these switches is a little weird, so read up:~~

~~* 90 switches with 67g tx springs (14mm), filmed with tx thick films from thicc films~~

~~* 20 switches with 67g tx springs (14mm) and filmed with kebo clear films, as the silencing material and any thicker films cause the bottom-out to be on the keycap instead of the stem for cherry profile r2 (at least on gmk caps)~~

~~* 9 switches with just the stock spring, filmed with tx thick films from thicc films~~

~~* 1 H1 switch with the silent red stem (accidently broke a switch lol)~~

~~Original ink springs are included.  **Looking for $125 shipped for the switches**~~ **SOLD**

~~**GMK WoB:** Bought from Amazon back in August and has been used on the novatouch for 2-3 weeks. Still in like new condition, as there's no shine and the texture is still present. Small amount of warping on 6.25u spacebars, and a bit more on the 7u, but both should still work fine. **Looking for $145 shipped in bags, or $140 + shipping if you'd like the trays**~~ **SOLD**","[US-CA] [H] Large Novatouch Bundle, 120x MX Silent Ink, GMK WoB [W] Paypal"

Hi All,

I have a set of GMK 9009 R3 Base keys that are BNIB/sealed. I'm looking to trade them for a set of GMK Phosphorous. I need the base and numpad sets. I'd also like the spacebars, but that's optional. I don't mind if they're not brand new, as long as they're in good condition and all sets are complete. I'd add money (through PayPal G&S) on top of my GMK 9009 base set to make the trade equal.

Alternatively, if anyone wants to just sell me their GMK Phosphorous set, I'd be down for that too!

Please comment here before PMing and don't use chat. Thanks!

Planned a pink-theme build for the wife but she wanted an iPad instead, so I'm selling these to fund a new board.

1. **GMK Olivia++ Light Base + Space bar kit + Hihihi Rama Enter.** Everything is new and unused. I only opened the Base seal to check the quality of the new GMK packaging. Was not disappointed. I'm selling these as a bundle for $600 plus shipping **SOLD** (sorry about the high price, it's basically what I paid plus Paypal fee).
2. **Fox 80SE Pink-Coral colour, TKL layout**. This is Fox's 3-year anniversary board, and I was told this was one of the special limited colour. It's hefty and gorgeous. Kit includes case, PCB, black aluminum plate & underplate foam. Selling for $680 plus shipping **SOLD**
3. **Infinikey Graen Base + Mega addon kit.** New and never used. Selling for $190 plus shipping **SOLD** 

Everything to be shipped from Vietnam. DHL Express costs around $40 for keysets and $65 for the board. Shipping fees for keysets can be lower if the buyer is based in the US as I can use my US proxy, but the discount compared to DHL is minor and in my opinion, not worth it.

Hi guys, as I have recently acquired some new keyboards, I am looking to sell some of my other ones.

**ID80 Kit**

This kit included GMK Screw - In stabs which have been clipped and lubed. Has the Idobao ID80 silencing foam.

**Drop Alt**

Had this for a few weeks but ended up getting an NK65 Entry and no longer having a need for it. Great little entry board. Has some foam and tissue between PCB and bottom of case to remove ping.

Comes with original key caps and accessories. No original box but will ship securely. Due to a mistake, pcb had to have a trace jumped ([Image](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/j0s5c2/remember_always_double_check_before_screwing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) \- Not pretty but board fully functional.)

Stabs have been lubed and modded.

Will come with Kaihl Speed Silver Switches or Zeal Healios Silent Switches.

**Infinikey Hive Core Set -** Again mainly looking for trades on this one, but option for sale is available. Mainly interested in other Infinikey Sets, like Sanctuary Rebirth, or other PBT keycap sets.

**NK65 Entry Smoke -** Only interested in trades for other 65% boards.

\*Disclaimer: Both items are known to have another round (E7-V2 and GMK Yuri r2) coming up soon

**CONUS ONLY**

1. Exclusive E7-V1:

Case in extremely good condition - bought second hand and used for less than 2 months. No visible blemishes or damage, but it has been used so I will give it 9/10. Comes with a brass plate and brass weight. Both have been cleaned using BKF cleaner but the plate has some smudges and scratches that I couldn't get rid of (check album for more info).

The PCB has been desoldered and has 2 dead keys that I millmaxed (7305) and bridged, so works fine now. I noticed that the diodes are installed in opposite directions for the dead keys, so with the right tools I think you can get it to work without the bridge. Got another desoldered PCB that has all the keys working, but 2/3 of the LED doesn't work. Will add that in the order in case you want to fix it yourself. Will add a spray painted LEMO cable (black) that I made with the order as well (micro to usb-A and about 5 feet).

Asking **$600 Shipped**

2. GMK Yuri (Base + Novelties + Glorious)

Used mainly with the E7-V1, so has about 2 months of use. Little to no shine, check the album for the slight shine I can see on the alphas. Overall, they are in very good condition. ~~Not looking to split at the moment.~~  Let me know if anyone is interested in just the base - got someone asking for just the novelties + glorious so am willing to split if needed. Am thinking of splitting it $210 shipped for the base and $130 shipped for the rest. Need buyers for both before I make the sale, hope you understand.

Asking **$330 Shipped**

Item | Condition | Price
----|---------|-----
Rama M60-a Dusk SEQ1 | Only used for 3-4 days, rest of the time spent in the box, no extra inner weight. Hotswap PCB. Unfortunately the time in storage has left the brass backweight with some small oxidation marks, not visible at distance or in many types of light, but can be seen during close inspection. Hard to capture on camera, but I included two pictures that show the marks. I contacted Rama Works about it, and they said it's an issue with the coating they use - it needs to be cleaned very carefully before being put away for storage, and I guess just using the provided cloth wasn't enough... Unfortunately, the oxidation marks can't be removed like on normal brass without also damaging the PVD coating. If you are the kind of person who requires utter flawlessness, then this board may not be for you unless you want to bypass the coating or try to get a replacement brass weight from Rama (I hear they may have extras from ongoing M60a runs) | ~~Asking 450$ + shipping.~~ **sold**

Hello to my fellow keyboard lovers !

I have an OG Cherry BoW Doubleshot ABS, WKL layout set to let go of. For those unfamiliar with OG Cherry, the moulding is the same as GMK, and the colors on par with GMK 9009/Retro without the accents.

I'm looking for an HHKB Hybrid Type S to trade or sell as is.

**Price includes PayPal tax and shipping tracked everywhere !**

~~90 Eur~~ SOLD | 1.[OG Cherry Black on White/Beige ANSI WKL](https://imgur.com/a/u2g85FE)  Description: No yellowing, glossy shiny on most of the keys, took it as I wanted to use it as a project to shine it glossy on all keys but I don't have time to do that any more. Check the album, some corners have wear too. The set needs a bath.

:--|:--:|--:
RAMA U80A Moon | Built w/ Gateron Silent Black Inks lubed with 205g0 and spring swapped with 65g TX springs and Durock Stabilizers lubed with 205g0. Comes with MT3 Susawatari Keycaps barely used. The pictures look like there is shine but it is just the nature of the plastic used. Also comes with extra Rose Gold external weight and Internal Dampener. The keyboard came with machining marks on bottom corner of the board straight from RAMA (Not caused by me). Not visible during use. Pictures of the marks [here](https://imgur.com/a/rNmIMp9) | **1250$ Shipped for everything** Not splitting
Silver Duck Orion V3 | Flawless condition. Comes with 2 PCBs (1 original PCB and 1 Snow.Pro PCB, BOTH millmaxed w/ 0305) and two plates (aluminum and Snow.Pro FR4 plate). Also has internal brass weight installed and comes with a carbon fiber external weight. | **1100$ Shipped**
CannonKeys Navy Savage65 | From the last drop. A-stock with flawless condition on the exterior. I believe there is some marks in the inside straight from CannonKeys but since its only the inside, it is considered a-stock by CannonKeys standards. Built w/ C3 Tangerines V2 (spring swapped to 65g TX Springs and lubed with 205g0) and Durock Stabilizers (Lubed w/ 205g0). PCB is millmaxed with 0305 sockets and the FR4 plate is the 6.25u spacebar variant. Comes w/ CannonKeys carrying case, sheet of neoprene foam inside the keyboard, and the polyfill in case you wanted that too. **Does not come with keycaps** | ~~Sold for 440$ Shipped~~
Switch Couture Matte Black Alice | Bottom is frosted acrylic to let the underglow RGB shine through. Will come with the extra matte black bottom piece if you wanted to swap it out. Comes with frosted acrylic feet installed. Built w/ Alpacas (lubed lightly with 205g0 using stock springs) and Durock Stabilizers (lubed with 205g0). **Does not come with keycaps** | **350$ Shipped**

|Matrix Abel+|Teal color, built with Thic Thock Marshmallows, Lubed, clipped and modded GMK Screw in stabs. Flawless condition, but has a small quirk with keymapping as many Matrix PCBS do. (L) Alt and (L) Windows keys position appear to be swapped. From what I've read the Abel+ PCB cannot be remapped, but I didn't invest a lot of time trying to figure it out. This will be a non issue for some and a deal breaker for others but wanted to make sure I put it out there. Shipped in original packaging. Keycaps not included|$700 / Trades|

After a year and a half of collecting and buying things aftermarket, I have run into some major financial obstacles that require me to sell off some of my beloved keebs/caps.  I understand the price of some may seem high, but with a major pet surgery looming, and my HVAC system looking like it won’t last another winter, I have to act. These are not FCFS and bundles/multiples will be prioritized since all of these prices include shipping if they are CONUS. Feel free to PM me with any questions about the condition of the caps/boards and I will help however I can.  Thank you for looking and hopefully you will find some of what you have been searching for here. Please comment before PM and only PM, I don’t use Reddit chat.

edit: Thank you all so much!  I'm going to be making another post soon with what is left and add some more to sell.  If you bought from me, I'm just one person so I'll pack/ship your caps/keebs as soon as I can!

^1 - Vintage switches can vary in smoothness and working condition, even on the same board. Please note that I can not test every individual switch or provide an ""x out of 10"" rating of smoothness as that's highly subjective - anyone who does that is probably more interested in advertising their goods rather than trying to provide actual info.

^2 - Untested! Untested items are indeed not tested. I have no idea if they work fully or at all. Because they're not tested, y'know. If working condition is important for you, I can (depending on the item) perhaps go and try if it works.

Shipping rates:

• I’ll have to use an expensive expedited service, since the cheaper national carrier has been [rekt by Covid.](https://pos.com.my/journal/sed-ut-perspiciatis-unde-omnis-iste-natus-error-sit-voluptatem-accusantium-doloremque-4.html)

• For reference, shipping to CONUS would cost $55.

• Shipping price is the same ($55) for 1 or 2 sets due to the combined weight being below the minimum threshold, so please buy more than 1 item ;)

• PM me if you need a quote to another country.

• Import taxes / duties are your responsibility.

Other notes:

• Prices above are inclusive of PP fees. Local cash will be cheaper.

• Not FCFS. Will give priority to folks who can meet locally, or people purchasing multiple items.

I have a total of 120x MX silent gateron ink switches, with these having the stems from cherry silent reds inside gateron ink v2 housings. They have all been lubed with krytox 205g0 on the slider rails, and the fronts and backs of the stem, and filmed. Springs installed in the switches have been oiled with victorinox oil. The configuration for these switches is a little weird, so read up: 

* 90 switches with 67g tx springs (14mm), filmed with tx thick films from thicc films

* 20 switches with 67g tx springs (14mm) and filmed with kebo clear films, as the silencing material and any thicker films cause the bottom-out to be on the keycap instead of the stem for cherry profile r2 (at least on gmk caps)

* 9 switches with just the stock spring, filmed with tx thick films from thicc films

* 1 H1 switch with the silent red stem (accidently broke a switch lol)

Original ink springs are included.  **Looking for $135 shipped for the whole bundle**",[US-CA] [H] 120x MX Silent Gateron Ink [W] Paypal

Hello everyone! I am looking to trade my fully built KBD67V2. It is built with the following:

* Case - KBD67V2 MKII in silver
* Plate - Built with the brass plate but I am including a sliver aluminum plate as well as a pom plate.
* Switches - 62g Zealio V2 lubed with Tribosys 3204
* Stabs - Zeal Transparent gold plated screw-in V2 lubed with Krytox 205g0

There are some small scratches on the case that I have included in the pictures. I also have some new rubber feet coming into the mail today so I will be putting those on as well.

Some of my wishlist for keycaps are:

* GMK Camping R2
* GMK Deep Space
* GMK Metropolis

I am also willing to sell for $400. I am local to the 91320 area. Thanks!","[US-CA] [H] KBD67V2 MKII [W] GMK Sets, Paypal, Local Cash"

*I am local to Houston 77054*

**I’m interested in buying a future funk deskmat and vaporwave novelties, new or used!**

*Tofu 60 Silicone Case Dampener*: this dampener was casted to completely occupy every bit of empty space in the case from every curve to crevice. The dampener height comes right up to the case standoffs to ensure a snug fit against the PCB; virtually eliminating all vibration from typing. As shown in the pictures, this dampener is very [malleable](https://imgur.com/a/ymDku5w) and can be easily cleaned by [rinsing](https://imgur.com/a/iY1yWeh) with water.  
**$25 shipped**

*GSK Celestial Hippo*: Artisan did not match my keycaps and thus was never mounted. [close up](https://imgur.com/a/X510b8Z)

~~Well I went a little ham on buying keyboard stuff this week so it's time to get rid of one of my boards~~

~~Rama U-80A Lake Hotswap RGB- In fantastic condition.  Comes with original box, brass weight, and built with lubed MX stabilizers.  Does not include a dampener.  Board is super beautiful but I couldn't bring myself to build it without a matching GMK set (none of the sets I have work with this navy/gold combo ATM).  I have GMK Delta on the way that's going to make it's way onto this board if the KBD sells.~~  **~~Asking $1,300 shipped via Paypal to the CONUS~~** **SOLD to** u/businesskitteh

~~KBDFans Black Aluminum KBD67 MK II Hotswap RGB complete build- This board is currently built with krytox 205g0 lubed macho/banana split switches (I didn't find any sound benefit in filming these) and a GMK cafe set that is about 3 weeks old with no shine.  Includes original box and the rest of the GMK Cafe Base set including the original GMK box as well.~~  **~~Asking $700 for the complete set shipped via Paypal to the CONUS~~**

~~I have so many boards on the way from group buys that I can really only justify carrying one of these right now, so once one board is gone the other is off the market.  I may consider splitting up the KBD67 and I have some lubed filmed Kiwi switches I could swap into the board for a small replacement fee.  I'm open to international shipping as long as buyer pays shipping and has positive rep on mechmarket.  If you are planning on chatting me, leave a comment before doing so.  Open to local cash 10026 and may be open to trades for certain GMK sets (mostly ones that would match the Lake board since I'm happy with Cafe on the KBDfans).  I would also be interested in swapping the KBD67 for a polycarbonate version.~~

I feel bad as I don't have any usage for it now. Right now I am basically getting rid of my collection. I have been good at it (and the board on me) so I would be happy if it would found a good owner.

Hi!

I've got these two wonderful discipline keyboards to sell or trade.  [Album](https://imgur.com/a/pV4KSfd)

&#x200B;

|Keyboard|Info|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Fully Build Discipline|Gateron Yellows with Invyr Uhmwpe stems (and a Gateron black, 67.5g spring for the spacebar) lubed with 205g0 and filmed with thicc films, GMK retooled stabs also lubed (dielectric and 205g0).|£200 ono.|
|Discipline kit|All the components are soldered on except switches! Comes with a laser-cut case (I have standoffs required for the case but I don't have screws or standoffs for the feet). The case has some slight dents from the laser cutter, as seen [here](https://imgur.com/X15K8oA) and [here](https://imgur.com/xJH4cbI).|£150 ono.|

The cases are a little different from what is recommended on Discipline Github its mostly made out of 3mm acrylic for the top, spacer and the bottom parts and the plate is 5mm (stab holes have been widened to accommodate).

If there is a request for a typing test for the fully build board, I'm happy to produce one, the sound quality won't be amazing (it will be from my phone), but I can say this board does sound pretty good. 

Willing to trade for high-end keycaps such as GMK, Infinikey etc, open to anything just send me a PM of the set and I'll see if I like it but the main sets I'm currently after:

* GMK WOB
* GMK BOW
* GMK URSA
* GMK Minimal

Any questions, just PM me :)

Item | Price | Description

Bamboo 60% | £110 | Everything except keycaps - bamboo case with lid, GH60 build with alu plate, lubed Gat silent bronws, tuned stabs, and matching mini-USB cable.
Cooler Master SK630 & custom cable | £90 | (Or £50 and £45 for the keyboard and cable separately.) I got the keyboard to try out the Cherry MX low profile reds (when I last looked they were only available in a few OEM boards). The keycaps show some wear but the keyboard is otherwise in excellent condition. The cable has a Weipu ST12 connector, the device-side section in sleeved in stainless steel and the host-side in MDPC-X.

Vintage Devlin doubleshots | £85 | From a POS terminal - [full layout and details of the profile here](https://imgur.com/a/d4bJZgi). Think they're quite rare - I've tried to hunt down more info about them, but couldn't find any.

Also got some switch lubing supplies:

Hello!

I am here now with several things for sale. I have gone a little too heavy-handed in buying things for this hobby, so I am looking to dial back the collection a little and move some neat things on to other people! What I have for sale is below:

**KEYBOARDS**

* **Tofu60 Acrylic Build w/ 67g Zealios v2**
This board is built with lubed Zealios v2 switches on a carbon fiber plate. Layout is 60%, but features arrow keys. Acrylic case is in like-new condition and the underglow from the PCB looks great. *Asking $250 shipped for this board*

* **KBD67 cases w/ built PCBs and plates**
I have two KBD67 cases (one E-white and one polycarb) that I want to sell along with either of the pictured PCB/switch/plate combos to make a full build. The combos are BSUN Holy Pandas, lubed, on an aluminum plate, and ZealPC Zilents 67g, lubed, on an aluminum plate. I am happy to pair either case with either PCB/switch/plate combo for any interested party. Both include case foam as well as clipped and lubed screw-in stabs. *Asking about $425 for either of these boards, but I am open to negotiating based on what you're interested in!*

**SWITCHES**

* **90x NK Creams**
These switches have been lubed with krytox 205g0 and filmed with clear kebo films, unused *Asking $85 for these switches*

* **67x Holy Pandas**
These have been lubed with Tribosys 3203, used briefly in HS board. *Asking $80 for these switches*

* **76x Holy Trash Pandas**
Lubed with Tribosys 3203, unused. *Asking $90 for these*

* **80x Silent Alpacas**
Stock switches, unused. *Asking $80 for these.*

**GMK KEYCAP SETS**

* **GMK Dualshot**
Sealed set. *Asking $300 for this*

* **GMK Peaches and Cream**
opened, mounted, and used for about two weeks. No shine. Includes full base set. *Asking $300 for this*

* **GMK Fro.yo**
Opened, mounted, and used for about one week on a secondary board. No shine whatsoever. Full base set. *Asking $225 for this*

All prices are negotiable! If you have other items you are interested in trading, I am willing to make swaps as well! Always looking for mid-range 65% boards and GMK keycap sets, or sets of 70+ switches. Willing to do partial trades and payment to anything as well.

Thanks for looking!","[US-KY][H] Tofu60 Acrylic, KBD67 built boards, Switches, GMK Sets [W] Paypal, local cash, trades"

Small writeup about 415keys stems:

The stems are much better than the V2 invyr ones. The INVYR are unusable, not as smooth, and overall just bad. These are really good in comparison. Less variation between stems and they fit most of the housings I tried very well. They are definitely very smooth and fun to use. Wobble isn't nearly as bad as the INVYR. Very nice stems (especially in gat/zeal housings!), I just didn't really enjoy them as much as I thought I would. 

Disclaimer: I cannot guarantee the housings you put the stems into will work, nor can I guarantee you will like them. I just stated what I have found thus far. I'm assuming the type of people who would buy PE stems are quite familiar with what they are, so I'm sure this disclaimer is not that useful anyway lmfao.

Hello r/MechMarket!

There is a lot of reading here but if you stick to the bold text you'll get the critical stuff. If something in bold interests you, THEN read the blurbs. I recently posted this for sale but I don’t think the appeal was there as I was trying to sell it as a bundle. CONUS ships free, Maple Gang pays shipping. NO EU, sorry.

**HEX.3C: Asking $220 Edit: Price cut due to removing a plate option. Recommend a solder build for this.**
Used for about a month. Comes with hardware/mounting materials (gasket/burger mount), a universal brass plate and the original black POM plate. POM plate has never been attempted but is likely better used as a half plate; brass has ultra-tight switch holes but is usable, I recommend it only if you’re going for a soldered build. Will include two foams and rubber dampener for the bottom of the case. Just want to explore larger form factors out there.

**AN-C PCBs: Asking $65 for Mill-Maxed and ~~$35 for De-soldered~~**
Been using the Hot-swap with ALU plate on the Mill-Max PCB. ~~Had built the Brass up with Zealios V2s but de-soldered to  split everything into separate sales. PCB was tested after de-soldering and everything was working properly.~~ They both have the original ALPs support. If you purchase the Hex and a PCB, I can throw in some the requisite lubed Durock stabs needed for $10 (clear stem, gold wire).

**Linears: x68 Creams for $75 (stock switches available rn on NK and Divinikey) or $90 for Durock L7s Lubed &amp; Filmed x69.**
Creams were lubed with 205g0 on housing and springs. L7s were lubed with 205g0 on housing and stems - GPL105 on 63.5g springs and filmed with Black Deskeys. They are in the board in the pic but I sprinkled a few at the bottom of the photo that kind of got cut off 😑. Ultra smooth for both batches. Only want to sell of one of these sets but message me regardless, might be willing to offload both sets of linears. 

**Strata Deskpad: $40**
Bought to match the keycaps, matches nicely. I’m not convinced I’m ready to sell off the Keycaps but I’ve got a RFPxNK_ Deskpad recently so I don’t need this one. Brand new, used for about 2 days then rolled up. Completely flat on roll out though which was amazing. I purchased the Deskpad for about $48 after shipping. It has seen very little use.

 **ePBT Miami Nights - *Maybe* asking for $65**
Depending on if I am able to get some caps that I want, I will sell these. Only caps that have been mounted are what’s seen in the picture. All great condition. Used as long as I’ve had the Hex. No shine. Have really enjoyed this set.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Trades/WTB:** 
These are things that I’ve kind of been browsing for but haven’t really nailed down an offering. Priorities go to sales tbh but if you have something that I list I'd considered a trade. Please PM me as I am highly interested in purchasing. Majority of funding is dependent on what I sell here but there is some PayPal in reserve.

**WTB/WTT Keyboards:**
-KBD8X Mkii (unbuilt kits only - Black, PC, or Dark Grey.)

-KBD75v2 (unbuilt kits only - Only looking for Black Anode. Brass weight is optional. Brass Plate preferred but not required.)

-PC Fanoe (unbuilt or built)

-NK65 Entry Smoke/Purple (must have detailed pics as there were many QC issues - not wanting to spend more than $130 but msg me nonetheless. Might spend a little bit more for purple due to its availability but we'll see.)

-KBD67 Mkii Hotswap Or Unbuilt kit (Preferably Ink Black or PC versions. Not my first choice but I’m interested nonetheless.)

-Klippe or Tofu (PC Versions or Dark Purple Tofu with Plate +/- PCB) 

**WTB/WTT Keycaps:**

-HK Gaming Modern Dolch Light
-GMK Delta (base)
-GMK Firefly (base) &lt;— Really interested 👀

Hi!

I'm willing to sell my Tofu 60 , built with Brass plate, Zeal60 v2 hotswap with Holtities , Zeal stabs (Lubed and band aided) , Zilents v2 or Black Inks (Your choise) , and GMK red samurai TKL kit.

Price is 360€ . I could split and sell only the keyboard for 210€.

The keyboard has some internal scratches along with some scratches on the brass plate, not really noticeable during daily use. Sometimes when you change a switch the holtities might come off (Not really often) you can just put them back in. RGB leds are perfectly working and via compatible.

Sadly have to sell some of my favorite things. I'm a college student and usually make money as a photographer, but due to being high risk, I have not been able to take photos outside of the occasional portrait client :(. Need to get rid of stuff before graduation as well. Also, have finally gotten my hands on a board I very much love, and haven't been using anything else since. Local is 19104/University City/Penn area. 

Prices do not include shipping. The shipping price will be a rough estimate, shipping receipt will be provided and if the estimate was over the actual price a reimbursement will be issued! Keycaps can be shipped in boxes or bags (let me know which you prefer).

Keycaps:  
~~[$90 SA Foundation Full set](https://imgur.com/a/zyV8NrG), mounted for 2 days before finally getting mt3 Serika (Sold for asking)~~  
~~[$100 -> $80 SA Royalty 60%](https://imgur.com/a/gCQwGQs) ANSI layout (7x 1.5u bottom row mods, custom Artisan spacebar to match set). [Custom paint job MX Master](https://imgur.com/a/kDdXVrv) and custom USB-C cable to match SA Royalty available. (PRICE DROPPED 100 -> 80, and now comes with mouse free.) Pending for $80 with MX Master included. Jealous of this buyer :(~~

Keyboards:  
[~~$110~~ $100 Vortex Pok3r](https://imgur.com/a/QraYXDj) case, plate, and PCB, with Gateron Yellow Inks, lubed with Krytox 205g0, and GMK clipped and lubed stabs (Superlube and 205g0). When desoldering I burned two traces, repair is visible in red wire in timestamp. Board is fully functional. Comes with all original keycaps, minus Caps, Spacebar, and Esc key. This was my first 'real mech' and some of the caps have been lost to time. The space bar and escape key pictured DO come with the keyboard, as does [this brown carrying bag](https://imgur.com/a/5G3kHn0). If you need a cable let me know. I do not have a replacement OEM caps lock, but who needs that crap anyways (you can switch it to be a fn key with the PCB/Program function).  
[$50 Acrylic case, GK61 PCB](https://imgur.com/a/EGJ6kCe), lubed plate mount stabs, steel plate.  

Switches:

[~~$110~~ $110 Hifiman HE-400s](https://imgur.com/a/GXlLGcv) Open Back Planars. Used for the last 3 years. Pads swapped out in Feb, only selling because I recently replaced these with Hifiman Devas (which sadly don't match my setup nearly as well :( - these go great with SA Foundation though!). Comes with [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5O8S4M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) cable (purchased September this year because old cable was too short), as well as a cheap USB-A DAC AMP that also comes with a cable. The headband has snapped in the same place several times due to dropping, but a dab of CA glue fixes it every time. Hifiman sells replacement metal headbands that are pretty nice, too. 

Bundles?  
Let me know if you want to bundle anything together. If you are new to the hobby and are interested in linear switches, we can work something out for the GK-61 + NK Creams + keycaps, or something similar.

---|---|---|---|---
~~West German Vintage MX Blacks^1 ^2~~ | [Album](https://postimg.cc/gallery/44t8Xpq) | D code, 1991. Some of the electronic components' legs looked sketchy so I opened a switch and, unfortunately, found out that there's some tarnishing on the copper leaves. Hence the low price. Nevertheless they feel great and could - worse comes to worst - be used as donors for stems and tops if they don't work consistently. | ~~75€~~ 50€ / Trades | ~~1x Available~~ **SOLD**

Comes with original box (doesn't appear to have been used, but rather stashed in some sort of TV cupboard, hence there's some yellowing on one side), and some funny paperwork. BTX was some kind of Teletext protocol that came up (and flopped) in the late 80s. MX Blacks, doubleshot caps (tertiary legends are green-ish print).  | ~~75€~~ 65€ / Trades | 1x Available

If you send me a timestamp with your Grandparents or somebody else who could get actual use out of it that's not *haha lol big letter keybab on my shelf*, I'll cut you a deal for half my asking price. **Caution**: Winkey G81 boards have caps with an offset bottom row that won't work with customs, unless you specifically design one for them. | ~~75€~~ 60€ / Trades | 1x Available

Looking for 90€ each for the ETFs, 60€ for the Gothcap, anything else, shoot me an offer - idk what these are or how to price them. Would happily give a hefty bundle discount despite already taking a loss as is. | Trades / Paypal | **SOLD** except for 4/20 ETF

&nbsp;

^1 - Vintage switches can vary in smoothness and working condition, even on the same board. Please note that I can not test every individual switch or provide an ""x out of 10"" rating of smoothness as that's highly subjective - anyone who does that is probably more interested in advertising their goods rather than trying to provide actual info.

^2 - Untested! Untested items are indeed not tested. I have no idea if they work fully or at all. Because they're not tested, y'know. If working condition is important for you, I can (depending on the item) perhaps go and try if it works.

RAMA U80A Moon | Built w/ Gateron Silent Black Inks lubed with 205g0 and spring swapped with 65g TX springs and Durock Stabilizers lubed with 205g0. Comes with MT3 Susawatari Keycaps barely used. The pictures look like there is shine but it is just the nature of the plastic used. Also comes with extra Rose Gold external weight and Internal Dampener. The keyboard came with machining marks on bottom corner of the board straight from RAMA (Not caused by me). Not visible during use. Pictures of the marks [here](https://imgur.com/a/rNmIMp9) | **1300$ Shipped for everything** Not splitting
Silver Duck Orion V3 | Flawless condition. Comes with 2 PCBs (1 original PCB and 1 Snow.Pro PCB, BOTH millmaxed w/ 0305) and two plates (aluminum and Snow.Pro FR4 plate). Also has internal brass weight installed and comes with a carbon fiber external weight. | **1100$ Shipped**
CannonKeys Navy Savage65 | From the last drop. A-stock with flawless condition on the exterior. I believe there is some marks in the inside straight from CannonKeys but since its only the inside, it is considered a-stock by CannonKeys standards. Built w/ C3 Tangerines V2 (spring swapped to 65g TX Springs and lubed with 205g0) and Durock Stabilizers (Lubed w/ 205g0). PCB is millmaxed with 0305 sockets and the FR4 plate is the 6.25u spacebar variant. Comes w/ CannonKeys carrying case, sheet of neoprene foam inside the keyboard, and the polyfill in case you wanted that too. This keyboard sounds amazing! **Does not come with keycaps** | **450$ Shipped**
Switch Couture Matte Black Alice | Bottom is frosted acrylic to let the underglow RGB shine through. Will come with the extra matte black bottom piece if you wanted to swap it out. Comes with frosted acrylic feet installed. Built w/ Alpacas (lubed lightly with 205g0 using stock springs) and Durock Stabilizers (lubed with 205g0). This keyboard also sounds amazing. **Does not come with keycaps** | **350$ Shipped**

Hi guys!

I'm looking to sell my Think 6.5 v1.
Its badgeless so these are pretty rare!
Its built with alpacas : black tx films, lubed with 3204, spring swapped to tx 65g which are oiled with 106. Stabs are gmk screw-ins bought early 2019.

I also have an extra new pcb to bundle. Both pcbs are solder ones. The one in the board has been desoldered once to go from Tealios to Alpacas. I'm the original owner, always took great care of it. It is in like new condition.

Price : 750 usd + shipping OBO (board + extra pcb)

NA only, priority to Canadians.

Minimal not for sale.

Important:

• Will shipped bagged. Trays not included.

• Selling as-is, no splitting kits.
______

Shipping rates:

• I’ll have to use an expensive expedited service, since the cheaper national carrier has been [rekt by Covid.](https://pos.com.my/journal/sed-ut-perspiciatis-unde-omnis-iste-natus-error-sit-voluptatem-accusantium-doloremque-4.html)

• For reference, shipping to CONUS would cost $55.

• Shipping price is the same ($55) for 1 or 2 sets due to the combined weight being below the minimum threshold, so please buy more than 1 item ;)

• PM me if you need a quote to another country.

• Import taxes / duties are your responsibility.

Other notes:

• Prices above are inclusive of PP fees. Local cash will be cheaper.

|KBDFans XDA keycaps|Took these off of a KBD67 MKII so these ONLY FIT 65% BOARDS WITH BLOCKERS and will not fit any other board. For example if you put all the keys in this set on a 65% board that has a blocker you will have used all the keys there will not be any left. If that doesn't make sense please ask me for clarification :)|$30 shipped|
|~~PBT Muted~~|~~Never used~~|~~$75 shipped~~|
|~~Perry60~~|~~HHKB Layout. Comes with a mill-maxed AN-C PCB. The case is stacked acrylic and the plate is isolated acrylic or POM I can't tell which. There is a crack in one of the layers which is depicted in the image. The PCB comes with it with stabs however I can't get the space key to work :( I tried a few different jump points close to the space switch holes but no luck. Maybe there is one on another position on the board.~~|~~$75 shipped~~|

**Built Black KBD67v2 MKII** with:

- Brass Plate
- Drop Holy Pandas Lubed w/ Tribosys 3203
- Genuine Screw-in GMK Stabs; clipped, housing lubed with Krytox 205g0, wires lubed with Permatex Dielectric Grease; wires have been rebalanced; band-aid modded

I've used this board for about 2 months and have decided that the board is not for me. The sound is good, but I don't think it's what I'm looking for. I didn't like the sound of a brass plate as much as I thought I would. [Here is a sound test with Matt3o MT3 /dev/tty keycaps.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WItq9eMfKEM) 

The board can be de-soldered and split, but preference will go to those who inquire about the built board.

**Asking for $400 shipped, $370 local pick-up**

**De-soldered is $345 shipped, $320 local pick-up**

**If you would like to purchase the board de-soldered and pair it with the Kiwis or the 62g Zeal Zilent v2s, PM and I will let you know the cost.**

I'm selling these because I don't like silent switches as much as I had hoped. 68 were mounted on a hotswap board, 1 was soldered.

Shipped in a bag, 2 have been mounted and soldered to for a sound and typing test. I'm not a big fan of the sound on the Kiwi switches, but they're made extremely well with little to no housing movement. For a charge, I can lube these switches with either: Tribosys 3203, Tribosys 3204, or Krytox 205g0 (if desired).

Hi all. Prices are in USD and do not include shipping. I would prefer shipping to Canada with Canada Post, but would consider shipping to the US with USPS. I'll try and ship it out within a day or two after payment. Rest of the items in the timestamp are not for sale. Would prefer to bundle both the tofu and PCB for **$95**.

| **GK64S PCB** | Used for about a month, hotswapped twice. I'll include the aluminium plate (if you want it) that came with the GK64S aluminium case, which I modded to fit in the Tofu 60 and support PCB mounted stabs. As you can see in the pictures, the plate is pretty roughed up. It also includes the battery that came with the GK64S and some GMK screw in stabilizers (except for LSHIFT, which doesn't support PCB mounted stabs on the GK64S) lubed with 205G0.  | ~~$40~~ **SOLD AS BUNDLE FOR $95** |

With a heavy heart I decided to sell my GMK Metropolis bundle to fund more keyboards / sets.

It consists of the **Base** kit, the **Signs** kit (novelties) and the **Blocks** kit (spacebars).

The set has only been used very lightly for a few weeks on an ortholinear board. There is barely any shine.

~~I'm asking €330 / $390 shipped to Europe~~. SOLD Shipping to the US is $20 extra. PayPal invoice will be issued in GBP. Payment by Revolut and Crypto attracts a 5% discount.

Just picked up this kit the other day with a very specific build in mind. Unfortunately, once I got everything put together I realized that it wasn't exactly everything that I hoped it would be. Therefore, I decided to look to see what trades I might be able to get.  I'm open to any GMK set atm, so please feel free to send me an offer and we can talk about it. 

The Sandstorm kit has only been mounted for pictures. The previous owner had used it for around week. Absolutely zero shine. 

Thank you!",[US-TN] [H] GMK Sandstorm [W] GMK kits

Bought this keyboard on an impulse, but am not a fan of the 60% form factor.  Beautiful case with no observable issues and good weight.  The PCB is brand new from KBD as well as the stabs. Switches were mounted to make sure everything on the PCB works and no issues identified. Since this is a hotswap, you may need a plate to get good mount w/o wobble.  Selling everything together.

Hi everyone,

Went a little crazy this past month buying keyboard stuff, so I'm looking to sell off some things. Need them gone ASAP (looking to join the d65 GB) so all prices are OBO.

All prices do not include shipping. Only shipping to Europe I'm afraid, no international shipping this time :(

&#x200B;

|Item|Notes|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Rama M60-A Moon|Has a couple of minor blemishes on the front bezel, but I don't see any other flaws (PM for more pics). I'm looking for a mid to high-end 65% as a replacement for this, so PM with trade offers if you want! Shipped in original RAMA box.|£570|
|GMK Cafe Base SOLD!!! + Black (Dark Alphas) Kit|Used sparingly on my M60 for about 10 days before realising I need a 65% board. Black kit is opened but unused (apart from the 7u spacebar). Shipped in original GMK packaging (or bags if you want to save on shipping)|£210 and £110 respectively, or buy both for £310|
|Biip 2048 Topre Base Kit SOLD!!! |Used for 2 weeks before changing my mind on HHKB (again, need that 65% layout!).|£65 (much cheaper than buying directly from kbdfans, which would run you close to £100 including import taxes)|
|HHKB Pro 2 Bluetooth SOLD!!!|Comes with black printed keycaps. This has Yang's bluetooth controller inside, which allows you to connect the board to your PC wirelessly, and also program the board using the YDKB Software. Also, sliders have been lubed and the board is modded with silenced x rings. Shipping in original HHKB packaging WITHOUT a battery (Royal Mail doesn't allow battery shipping). I'll send a link to where I bought my battery though. I'll also include the original HHKB controller in case you want to switch back.|£210 (again, much cheaper than if you bought a new one for £185 and then purchased x rings and the bluetooth controller for close to £70). If you buy the biip keyset AND the HHKB, you can have em for £260)|
|Niu Mini|Built with lubed gateron ink blacks and blank black DSA keycaps. Bought from another r/mm user who used it for a few weeks, and I have not used it at all.|£115|
|Tofu 65 Black Hotswap Kit SOLD!!!|Comes with DZ65 RGB Hotswap PCB, Aluminium Plate, GMK screw in stabs (clipped, lubed, and band aid modded), and case foam. Only flaw(s) are the minor blemishes on the brass weight on the bottom (PM for pics), apart from that the case is in pristine condition. If you REALLY don't want them to be visible, you can always just flip the weight over :) This is a perfect beginner board, all you need are switches and keycaps and you're ready to go!|£160 (you'd be spending at least £40 more buying directly from kbdfans)|

Trades wise I'm interested in any cool, mid to high-end, 65% or spaced out 75% (i.e. not like KBD75) layout board. I'm a sucker for boards with rounded corners (like space) so would be very interested in one of those! Also interested in the following keycap sets:

GMK WoB

GMK Oblivion

SA Oblivion

GMK Night Runner (particularly interested in this for my space65)

GMK Terminal

MT3 Susuwatari

Any other interesting sets!

Hello mechmarket !

All prices are OBO, **do not hesitate to shoot any offer.**

Prices do not include shipping, they will be calculated on a case-per-case basis. I have some pretty cheap shipping options in France, even for heavy items and international shipping, but keep in mind COVID made them a bit more expensive tho.

The keyboard is in good and clean condition: no flaws, scratches, dents. Comes with its original packaging, PCB hasn't been desoldered before, but if you don't want the switches, I can desolder and send the switches separately.

Hello, [r/mechmarket](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/) !

&#x200B;

I recently got GMK Dots in a trade and then realized I don't touch type (yeah, I am not worthy of this hobby, I know).

So I am looking to trade it for a cool GMK set. Since prices on most sets are INSANE right now, I wanted to trade instead. Priorities are GMK Olivia++ Light base with RAMA enter (will add paypal on my side). Also I like Taro, Phantom, Dolch, Serika.

Hey everyone, I'm looking to sell a full set of never used GMK Hyperfuse Remix keycaps. I bought them  during the first preorder window with the intention of using some of the modifier keys only. I decided to wait for my current set to show some age before actually using them though. Fast Forward to now and I'm still using my current HFO set and this pandemic has me in a spot financially.

Wasn't sure on a good asking price considering this set is no longer available and mostprior listings I saw were for used or partial sets.

New NK65 Entry Frost I just got today. Keycaps mounted for pics, then put back in packaging. Comes with Kailh Blacks, not looking to split.

I'm letting it go because I think the feel of plate-mount stabilizers are absolute poopoo shite. I ordered an Alu version last month, and the stabs were so bad that I had to do some modifications. I thought it would be different if I ordered a completely different version one month later, but nope. This time, something is gravely wrong with the backspace stab (I only tested it with 1 type of keycap so it may be good for you). As compensation, I'll include 4x 7u original Cherry plate-mount stabs that you can harvest from to fix the issue. Moral of my story? I won't buy any more NK65s :)

I also included images of some light damage on the return60. The scratches on the top case came with the board when I ordered it. None of the damage is visible when everything is assembled. I accidentally stripped the screws so I'm replacing the entire set of original screws with philips screws which were easier to remove and am including an extra set with it.

| **Tofu 60 Silver** | Used for about a month, it does have a few defects / signs of use (see pictures), but it would be barely noticeable when built.

|**GK64S** | Used for about a month, hotswapped twice. It includes the aluminium plate that came with the GK64S aluminium case, which I modded to fit in the Tofu 60 and support PCB mounted stabs. As you can see in the pictures, the plate is pretty roughed up. I would suggest getting a separate plate altogether, but I'll still throw it in with the PCB. It also includes the battery that came with the GK64S and some GMK screw in stabilizers lubed with 205G0. I can also include the original GK64 aluminium case, but do note it will kind of look weird when built with the provided plate since I sanded down the plate corners to fit in the Tofu 60.  | ~~$50, $70 with the GK64 aluminium case~~ **SOLD [here](https://reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/jeri3f/caqc_h_tofu_60_silver_gk64s_pcb_w_paypal)**|

For context, I'm completely out of the hobby and have been for years now. I know this keyboard may be controversial but I am not really looking to have a discussion about it. I am just hoping to sell this keyboard to another person who will appreciate it. I am looking to sell my replica Silver WKL Koala with brass insert that I got from a Korean group buy via a Korean based GH member named Naasby. I am the only previous owner of this keyboard. (I am radio_killah on GH)

I built it myself very early in 2017 after buying the board in late 2016. The keyboard has a brass weight in the case and a brass plate. It is built using one of Leeku's Jigon 87key PCBs and stickered ergo clears that I ordered from GON. The stabs are a set of the gold and clear screw in stabilizers from ZealPC. It has a dense foam liner for sound dampening. The brass weight in the base of the case has a clear plastic tape over it to prevent tarnishing. The brass plate is in good condition with minor signs of tarnishing. This keyboard has spent most of its life in drawer inside a keyboard bag.

I used this keyboard with a set of Round 1 GMK 9009 which I still have and can bundle with the keyboard if interested.

Hi guys,

I want to sell my black Tofu 60% Hotswap buyed on 25th august, cause it was my first custom keeb and i noticed i really prefer the 65% layout with arrows, and as you can see from the timestamp i moved already to the 65% layout.

Anyway this is the build :

\- KBDfans Tofu 60% aluminum case × 1

\- DZ60RGB-ANSI v2 PCB HOTSWAP × 1

\- Brass 60% plate × 1 ( with adesive KBD module foam)

\- DZ60RGB-ANSI Case Foam × 1

\- GMK Screw-in Stabilizers × 1 ( with KBDfans Stabilizers foam sticker and lubed with Superlube grease)

\- Novelkey x Kailh Linear Cream Switch x61 (lubed with krytox)

I really prefer to sell all the bundle keyboard + switches and im looking for 250€ plus shipping ( around 10€ in EU) , that is the price i payed without the customs fees. Only EU buyers.

What it comes with 
1.	Keyboard
2.	67 box whites (unlubed)
3.	67 Zealios 62g (unlubed)
4.	Genuine Cherry Stabs (clipped, dielectric grease, band aid mod)
5.	OEM stabs (clipped, dielectric grease, band aid mod)
6.	USB Cable

What it DOESN’T come with
1.	Keycap puller
2.	Switch puller

The board is in great condition, might have some scuffs on the integrated plate due to removing switches. Please refer to the images: 

I’ve replaced the stabs with genuine cherry stabs that have been clipped and lubed with dielectric grease (installed), and band aid modded. I will also include the OEM stabs in a separate bag (that are also clipped and lubed with dielectric grease). Lastly the board will come included with the stock keycaps, which I believe are PBT, and have shine through legends.

Hi all,

I'm clearing out some of the things I never use. Europe preferred, but can do outside of Europe too. During covid times, shipping can get costly but I'm happy to get quotes. Let me know where you live :)

I prefer shipping with DHL, but I might be able to get something else to work, in a pinch.

1. MG Ember Dusk kit: Unused, new in box (only opened to look at) - 150 euros \*\*PENDING\*\*
2. Drop + RedSuns GMK Red Samurai ORTHO kit: used lightly, can't see any shine - 80 euros
3. SA Vilebloom ORTHO kit: unused, unopened, new in bag - 85 euros \*\*SOLD\*\*
4. SA Vilebloom ERGODOX kit: unused, unopened, new in bag - 95 euros \*\*SOLD\*\*

&#x200B;

SA keycaps really do just ship in these little baggies from Signature Plastics, but they are in perfect, factory new condition. I have not opened these baggies.

This is almost exactly what I paid for these kits originally.

If you have any questions, let me know!

I would prefer in-person trade/pickup, I live in Berlin. For selling I would prefer payment in cash, but paypal would also be OK. I can also ship it, then shipping cost of your choosing comes on top.

edit: I forgot the timestamp. Now it's there.

edit2: pricing of single items:

cyberdeck = 165 pcs (on the written on the package)

novelties = 41 pcs 

EDIT: both sets are SOLD.

165 + 41 = 206

280€ * (41 / 206) = 55.72 ~= 56€ for the novelties only.

Hi mm, I am parting with these Oblivion V2 kits. New and unused, still in plastic wrapping. 

No FCFS I'm afraid, priority goes to nordic and EU buyers, because of shipping cost and the uncertainty of everything at this point.

My asking price is 305EUR before shipping for both kits. I prefer to sell as a bundle, but let me know if you are only interested in one of the kits, and maybe we can figure something out.

Hey mm, hope y'all are well tonight. I'm still trying to sell a couple of boards. If you're interested and have any questions about either board please feel free to send me a PM and we can talk about it.

So, first up tonight is an unbuilt black/brass Keycult 1/60. This is such a dope board, and over the last few weeks of posting it I've been getting more and more sentimental about letting it go. Ultimately, I did find my dream board so I'll never be able to justify keeping this. The board is b-stock, but outside of the miniscule spec on the back it looks absolutely flawless. The board comes with 1x unopened PCB, 1x full polycarbonate plate, and 2x brass plates. **Asking $1875 local or $1950 shipped to CONUS.**

~~Next up is a black Tofu 60%. It has a hotswap DZ60 with the arrow key layout, NK creams lubed with 205g0, and smokey durock stabs lubed with 205g0. For this I'm asking **$220 local cash or $250 shipped.**~~ SOLD for asking

Okay now that all that junk is out of the way let's get down to the **REAL** important dealings tonight. I was lucky enough to buy GMK Sandstorm off of a really nice person here on mm. Unfortunately, I realized too late that the base kit does not come with support for 66% keyboards. All I need is a 2.25u shift from someone who has an extension kit. If anyone would be kind enough to offer up theirs I would really appreciate it, and I'm sure we could work out something fair when it comes to price.

That wraps it up for me tonight. If you're reading this I hope you have a safe weekend. Please, if you have any interest in any of my items, **comment before you PM and do not use reddit chat.**","[US-TN] [H] Keycult 1/60 Black/Brass, Built Black Tofu 60% [W] Local Cash, PayPal, GMK Sandstorm 2.25u Shift"

This is a Canoe Gen2 in the limited edition EVA-01 color way built with Custom EVA-01 frankenswitches. The frankenswitches were created and lubed by reddit user ChanDaddyPurps which consists of NovelKeys Dry Series Bottom Housing with Gateron x MiTo Laser Tops, V2 C³Equalz Tangerine Stems, 67g Gold Plated Springs, and Orange TX Films. The C3 grey stabilizers and the switches are both lubed with Krytox 205g0. The keyboard currently has the included black gaskets from the original packaging, which are softer than the red gaskets, also included in the package. The green aluminum weight is currently installed rather than the polished brass weight. Included in the package are all the accessories that originally came with the package: the red gaskets, the red and blue LED light diffusers, polished brass weight, and internal foam that I chose not to install. There is neoprene foam packed inside to reduce reverb, and the overall typing feel is still very firm, yet extremely smooth thanks to the switches.

Item | Price | Description

Bamboo 60% | £120 | Everything except keycaps - bamboo case with lid, GH60 build with alu plate, lubed Gat silent bronws, tuned stabs, and matching mini-USB cable.
Cooler Master SK630 & custom cable | £90 | (Or £55 and £45 for the keyboard and cable separately.) I got the keyboard to try out the Cherry MX low profile reds (when I last looked they were only available in a few OEM boards). The keycaps show some wear but the keyboard is otherwise in excellent condition. The cable has a Weipu ST12 connector, the device-side section in sleeved in stainless steel and the host-side in MDPC-X. 
Cherry G80-8000 | £55 | Brand new in box, chock-full of retooled blacks. [Sounds pretty good.](https://i.imgur.com/QOLBxLv.mp4)

Vintage Devlin doubleshots | £85 | From a POS terminal - [full layout and details of the profile here](https://imgur.com/a/d4bJZgi). Think they're quite rare - I've tried to hunt down more info about them, but couldn't find any.
SP DSA pastel white keycaps *(pending)* | £18 | Identical to those mounted on the Contra. Suitable for Planck-like layouts (48 x 1u + 1 x 2u).   
  
Also got some switch lubing supplies:

The recent delivery of the [Function96](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/jbd843/function96_v1_its_alive/) is pushing a few things out of the stable:

1.	~~Cannonkeys Rekt1800 Black, Unbuilt (De-built?) | This is a fantastic 1800/CP layout board. Why? It doesn’t cost a fortune, it doesn’t weigh a ton, it looks downright austere, and it sounds great due to the combination of burger mount, FR4 plate, and polyfill. I originally received this board built with Inks, and I’d advise a similar build to the buyer. However, it comes as a kit, so you can build it however you want! PCB desoldered with FR-301 and cleaned with isopropyl. During cleaning, diode D76 came off due to a cold solder on one side. I replaced it with a diode of slightly larger size (see photos). Everything tweezer tests just fine. The chassis does have a small anodizing defect on the back near the USB-C cutout. It’s a white spot, not a scratch, and I’m not sure what could have caused it. Comes with 6.25U plate, 7U plate, PCB, fasteners, polyfill, and Cannonkeys soft carrying case. Asking for $550 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

2.	~~Iris Rev3 built w/Gateron Milky Yellows, C3 stabs | Some say that split ergo isn’t done correctly without tenting, well, with this board it’s not a problem. Sandwich case with aluminum switch plate, aluminum bottom plate, and thick acrylic tenting mid-layer. Included bolts thread through the eyelets in the acrylic mid-layer, and are covered with rubber sleeves (included) to not mar your desk. Tremendous flexibility in how you choose to tent it. Switches are lubed, but I am not certain of the lubricant used. Includes some spare standoff hardware. Does not include USB or TRRS cable. Asking for $155 shipped~~ **SOLD for $150 shipped**

3.	~~Doubleshot WoB keycaps of unknown origin | Received these with a board. These are quality Cherry profile keycaps, with crisp legends and no warp on the long keys. I believe this set may be sold on Aliexpress, but I’m not sure. Coverage for ANSI 108-key and beyond, including split space and 6U (!) spacebars. Asking for $50 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

4.	~~MDA Big Bone TKL keycap kit | Tried out the MDA profile on these caps. The keycap surfaces are positively enormous and almost flat, a very very unique look for any keyboard. The legends are huge and crisp, dyesub on PBT. Coverage for ANSI TKL and any subset of that. Asking for $65 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

5.	**Geekeys PBT Dark Grey keycaps** | This set is of lower quality than the others in terms of the keycap finish (glossier rather than textured), but the long keys are not warped and it’s perfectly typeable. Cherry profile, with coverage for ANSI 104-key as well as Tsangan and 6U (!) bottom rows. Some shine on the caps, see photos. **Asking for $35 shipped**

6.	**Drop CTRL stock Shine-Through keycaps** | Full TKL keycap set from a Drop CTRL. No shine on the keycap surfaces. OEM profile for LED clearance, and the legends are on the north side of the switch. **Asking for $39 shipped**

7.	~~Kailh Box White (qty 48) & Navy (qty 32) Combo | This is perfect for a combination of Whites on alphas, Navy on mods, or for populating a split ergo board. Navy switches are unused, Whites are desoldered, and they’re all 3-pin. Not splitting up this set. Asking for $30 shipped.~~ **SOLD for asking**

8.	**Zealios V2 67g (qty 132)** | Unmodified, unused Zealios V2 67g keyswitches. 5-pin. Not splitting up this set. **Asking for $140 shipped**

9.	**Kailh Pro Purple (qty 97)** | Desoldered from a board. Switches do not appear to be lubricated. **Asking for $45 shipped**

10. ~~Cherry RT Blacks (qty 99) lubed & filmed | Unused, already lubed w/205g0 and filmed with TX films. Stock springs. Asking for $66 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

11. ~~Cherry RT Blacks (qty 48) lubed & filmed w/63.5 slows | Desoldered from a Planck. Lubed with 205g0, filmed with TX films, and spring-swapped with Sprit 63.5 slows.  Asking for $33 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

12. ~~Novelkeys Nolive Creams (qty 65) lubed & filmed | Desoldered from an alice board. Lubed with 205g0, filmed with clear TX films. Asking for $40 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

13. ~~MOD-M Tactile (qty 68) lubed | Desoldered from a 65% board. Lubed with 205g0. Asking for $30 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

14. ~~MOD-L Tactile (qty 88) lubed | Desoldered from a TKL board. Lubed with 205g0. Asking for $40 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

15. ~~Cherry Reds (qty 99) lubed | Pulled from a hotswap board, never soldered. Lubed with Finish Line PTFE superlube. Asking for $25 shipped.~~ **REMOVED from sale**

16. ~~KBDFans Blue Acrylic Lube Station | Unused. Asking for $38 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

P.S. For the Polaris, if you want me to build it, I will happily build it for you with whatever switches I have on hand and whatnot (just PM me).

It will come with your choice of either a milmax or solderable (desoldered) PCB as well as a PC Plate or Brass Plate. Things to note: the milmax PCB was sent to me scuffed (i.e. some pads were lifted) which was fixed when I bridged some of the milmax sockets so now it is fully functional. Feel free to ask if you want to bundle any of the other extras and I will give you a quote (it will be discounted).~~

**Built Black KBD67v2 MKII** with:

- Brass Plate
- Drop Holy Pandas Lubed w/ Tribosys 3203
- Genuine Screw-in GMK Stabs; clipped, housing lubed with Krytox 205g0, wires lubed with Permatex Dielectric Grease; wires have been rebalanced; band-aid modded

I've used this board for about 2 months and have decided that the board is not for me. The sound is good, but I don't think it's what I'm looking for. I didn't like the sound of a brass plate as much as I thought I would. It's very lively, but slightly higher pitched than I would have liked, so I am putting this up for sale. [Here is a sound test with Matt3o MT3 /dev/tty keycaps.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WItq9eMfKEM) 

The board can be de-soldered and split, but preference will go to those who inquire about the built board. If desired, I can include the coiled USB-C to USB-A cable with the purchase free of cost.

**Asking for $415 shipped, $395 local pick-up**

**De-soldered is $345 shipped, $325 local pick-up**

**If you would like to purchase the board de-soldered and pair it with the Kiwis or the 62g Zeal Zilent v2s, PM and I will let you know the cost.**

//---------------------------------------------

**69x 62g Zeal Zilent v2 Lubed w/ Tribosys 3204 and Filmed w/ 0.125mm Kebo Switch Films**

These will be shipped in a bag. These switches are extremely smooth with a nice and pronounced tactile bump. I'm selling these because I don't like silent switches as much as I had hoped. I realized that I love the deep thocky sounds of normal switches, so I won't be using these. 68 were mounted on a hotswap board, 1 was soldered.

**Asking for $105 shipped, $100 local pick-up**

//---------------------------------------------

**80x Stock C3 x TKC Kiwi Switches**

Shipped in a bag, 2 have been mounted and soldered to for a sound and typing test. I'm not a big fan of the sound on the Kiwi switches, but they're made extremely well with little to no housing movement.

**EDIT 15 MINUTES AFTER POSTING:** I've received a lot of interest in both GMK sets. I'll sell to first in queue if nobody local turns up by this weekend.

Hi MM. I’m selling some stuff to free up shelf space.

Item Name & Description | Condition | Price 
:--|:--:|--:
[Norbatouch Grey Prototype Case](https://imgur.com/a/Yf55J) | Glossy powdercoat. Purchased in September 2016. Used, has minor signs of wear (please read additional comments below). | US$280 firm + shipping
~~[GMK Classic Retro Cyrillic](https://matrixzj.github.io/docs/gmk-keycaps/Classic-Retro-Cyrillic/)~~ | ~~From Originative. Purchased in November 2017. Factory sealed / MISB.~~ | ~~US$265 firm + shipping~~ SOLD
~~[GMK Red Honey Cyrillic](https://matrixzj.github.io/docs/gmk-keycaps/Red-Honey-Cyrillic/)~~ | ~~From Originative. Purchased in Q2 2018. Factory sealed / MISB.~~ | ~~US$225 firm + shipping~~ SOLD

Shipping rates:

• I’ll have to use an expensive expedited service, since the cheaper national carrier has been [rekt by Covid.](https://pos.com.my/journal/sed-ut-perspiciatis-unde-omnis-iste-natus-error-sit-voluptatem-accusantium-doloremque-4.html)

• For reference, shipping to CONUS would cost $70 for the Norbacase, or $55 for the GMK sets.

• Shipping price is the same ($55) for one or both GMK sets due to the combined weight being below the minimum threshold, so please buy both together ;)

• PM me if you need a quote to another country.

• Import taxes / duties are your responsibility.

______

Comments on the Norbatouch prototype:

• Matching riser feet are included.

• Powder coat is a touch uneven. The top case can pivot slightly against the bottom case if pressure is applied at certain angles, resulting in a rocking motion. This can be minimized / eliminated with tape + some patience.

• A couple of the screw holes are improperly tapped.

• Some scratches / scuffs are visible from up close, but they’re generally minor especially given the age & designation of the item. Don’t buy if expecting to be flawless.

• I would consider this more of a collectible than a keyboard case (because it’s Norbauer’s first project), which is why I’m apprehensive about using it, but that’s just my misguided sentiment.

______

Other notes:

• Prices above are inclusive of PP fees. Local cash will be cheaper.

• Not FCFS. Will give priority to folks who can meet locally, or people purchasing multiple items.

• Please comment below before PMing.

* **Everything is new** unless stated otherwise.

* Pm first.
* Not necessarily fcfs.
* Bundles / trades get priority.
* Prefer to ship keysets in bags. I know that sucks, but it's a lot cheaper and I don't have big boxes that fit GMK sets.  If you really want your GMK Box, we can work something out.
* I'll try to reply to everyone, but if it gets overwhelming I""ll just update this thread.

**~~OG doubleshoots (cyrillic sublegends)~~**~~-~~ [~~picture here~~](https://imgur.com/a/gjEa3Sl)

~~Sourced from a Cherry~~ [~~g81-8904HPBRB~~](https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?f=62&t=7835)~~, never heard of the board, probably the closest (and cheapest) you can get to a set of g81-3000SAV,~~

~~IMPORTANT- please read the following descriptions as there are a few things you must know before looking to get this set.~~

~~\*CONDITION- the set is in pretty rough condition, the alphas are pretty yellowed, and there is of course shine.~~

[~~Broken keycaps~~](https://imgur.com/a/5lLvluw)~~- Not sure what happened, but it appears that these three keycaps got chipped. The stem insertion still remains intact, but yeah. the third keycap is unusable anyways~~

[~~Incompatible spacebar row~~](https://imgur.com/a/LPsICbu)~~- it appears that the placement of switches on the original keyboard had some wack location, with that said, the way the stem insertions are, entire bottom row is incompatible. You will most likely have to source some mod kit to replace these~~

\- Shipping prices to usa generally are 20-40 (depends on various reasons, I have calculated estimated price for some already)

\- PRICE<50 eur is untracked unless +2.5 eur for tracked;

Typing experience is unreal and the small form factor really makes it special in my opinion. That being said I really want to upgrade into a larger form factor (65% and MGA Alice), as such I am more than willing to add paypal towards any interesting trades. For those who really want this board I am willing to part with this keyboard at $550 which is above the market price as I really want to trade.

Pretty self explanatory, purchased on the first SC gb. Other than the one issue with B the board is perfect, I would have definitely re-soldered the Malice but I am way too busy as of this moment.

Note: These are not keycaps from Novelkeys, but are from the same molds and same factory and are the same quality. They're exactly the same, just without the novelkeys branding. Cherry profile.

Need to make some space, so dropping the price on these! 

Item | Price | Description
:--|:--|:--
Bamboo 60% | £120 | Everything except keycaps - bamboo case with lid, GH60 build with alu plate, lubed Gat silent bronws, tuned stabs, and matching mini-USB cable.
Contra 40% bundle | £110 | Bundle includes the matching (reverse) coiled aviator cable & new SP DSA blank pastel white keycaps. Built with lubed Cherry blacks, Durock stab, socketed pro micro.
Cooler Master SK630 & custom cable | £90 | (Or £55 and £45 for the keyboard and cable separately.) I got the keyboard to try out the Cherry MX low profile reds (when I last looked they were only available in a few OEM boards). The keycaps show some wear but the keyboard is otherwise in excellent condition. The cable has a Weipu ST12 connector, the device-side section in sleeved in stainless steel and the host-side in MDPC-X. 
Cherry G80-8000 | £55 | Brand new in box, chock-full of retooled blacks. [Sounds pretty good.](https://i.imgur.com/QOLBxLv.mp4)
Filco Minila Air | £48 | Worn-in cherry browns - [sound test.](https://i.imgur.com/XTEXgUn.mp4) Can provide additional keycaps for compatibility with cherry profile sets (3u spacebar etc.)
Vintage Devlin doubleshots | £85 | From a POS terminal - [full layout and details of the profile here](https://imgur.com/a/d4bJZgi). Think they're quite rare - I've tried to hunt down more info about them, but couldn't find any.
SP DSA pastel white keycaps *(pending)* | £18 | Identical to those mounted on the Contra. Suitable for Planck-like layouts (48 x 1u + 1 x 2u).   
  
Also got some switch lubing supplies:

Hi everyone,

I'm selling the GMK Cafe Base Kit and Dark Alphas (Black) Kit. It has been used lightly on my M60-A for the past 2 weeks, and only mounted (never used) on my Niu Mini. I'm looking to get £315 + shipping for it, which is less than what I paid for the set. 

I will also consider trades for the following:

 - ALF F62-PE 

 - IBM Model F62 ""Kishsaver"" Replica

 - Other cool chunky boards, send me your offers!

I'm only shipping to the UK at the moment, but I will consider EU shipping as well if there is enough interest. It will be shipped in the GMK trays displayed in the timestamp.

Another thing to consider is that this will fill some combinations of 2 boards with different layouts. So it's not horrendously expensive if you split the cost over 2 boards :)

Hello!

Bumping this listing from a couple of days ago.

I'm selling a 40% ortho build and 60% sleeve. Details below.

**SELLING:**

**Board (Planck/Shark w/ Underglow):** Here are the specs and price breakdown:

Shark PCB (Like the Planck rev6, but soldered and south-facing): USB-C, QMK, ortho. MIT layout, also supports Grid and 2x2U if you desolder (would need a different plate). Love this PCB, but I have 2 so I'm selling this one. Compatible with Planck cases, I soldered the necessary standoffs. Will include M2 screws. Also soldered underglow LEDs so if you got a frosted acrylic case or diffuser you could show off some RGB. - $50

Plate: Brass, sandblasted, 1.5 mm from LaserBoost. Really nice plate. Cost 44 Euros + shipping from Spain, so I figure - $55

Foam: plate foam from MKUltra installed (between plate and PCB). - $5

Case: Space Grey Hi-Pro aluminum Planck case - $30

Switches: 67g Zilents V2, lubed with 3203, springs lubed with GPL 105. - $50

Shipping/PayPal fees: 10$ to US.

~~Total for board: $200 shipped.~~ Board parted out.

Note about board: The 2U spacebar does not have a stabilizer. I don't think it needs one, and the creator of the Planck doesn't recommend it, so I figured I wouldn't deal with silencing a stab for this build. If you wanted to add one you'd have to desolder the whole thing. Like I said, though, feels just fine without it.

**Sleeve:** From Keyboard Wear, feels pretty good quality. Sized for 60% board. All black, velcro, outside cable pocket. Got this for a Tofu build I did but by the time it arrived I'd moved on to ortho. Never used. - ~~$30 shipped.~~ Sold in bumped post.

**BUYING:**

I'm also looking to buy any of these keycap sets, please message me an offer if you have one:

KAT Milkshake Alphas/Weirdos + Nomad

~~GMK Dots Base + Nomad~~ Waiting for R2.

GMK Café Base + Special Blends (40s)

GMK Olivia Light + Extension (40s)

GMK Mizu Base + Novelties + 40s 

GMK 9009 R3 Base + ~~Obscure (40s)~~ Bought Obscure.

Let me know if you have any questions, and please comment before PM (no chat, please, I can't use chat on this app).

Thank you.","[US-MO] [H] Planck (Shark) w/ Underglow, 60% Sleeve [W] PayPal, Keycaps"

Hello all, I recently pieced this Dark Rose Gold Savage65 together (I did not solder it) and I did a test run on how it would feel and sound but it is not to my liking and therefore I would like to trade it/ sell it.

I have some lubed and filmed gateron merlots and Moyu Blacks/Everglide dark jades. Will update after I finish studying because I made this post in a hurry. **Prices AreOBO**

Hello. I got got a couple things I want to sell. 

GMK Dual shot - I got this before I decided to build a fresh new PC and decided I want to sell it to help pay for it. Brand new still in the plastic. Just got it today. 325$ plus shipping Or Best Offer. SOLD FOR $325

Lily58 - I have a built Lily58. I 3D printed a white case and plate, but I also have a black metal plate it came with. I could 3d print a black or red case if gou prefer for a bit more money. It is having issues with the “M” key not registering. But all other keys work. Has OLED screen and an elite C on the left side unit. I never really used it as I like 60% or 96% boards more. It has Pale Blue Switches in it. As well as TKC turquoise Blank caps I can include for 20$ more. I’d do 125$ for just the lily59 and case, and 150$ + Shipping for total build w/ all the turquoise cap set.

I’d consider trading for a black or white built KBD19x or similar with linear switches. 

Please Comment PM and then PM me.

Letting go of more things for upcoming things -- just shipping, really.

I can ship internationally; just ask for a quote, and total price will be calculated accordingly. If in rare cases of Local Cash, I live at 95472.

Please ask if you have any questions or inquiries. Offers are welcomed.

**KBD8X MKII and KBDPAD MKII** \-- Good condition.  [Album 1 (Most recent condition)](https://imgur.com/a/ayOrTl8)  [Album 2 (When it arrived)](https://imgur.com/a/mJPAOOL)  For the board, the black top is A-stock while the e-white is B-stock.  For the pad, the e-white top is a-stock and the pink top is C-stock (defective).   Please, please, please inspect the pictures and see for yourself what you're getting into -- I've documented pretty much every little defect on the boards.  The board as a whole is in relatively good condition, but not exquisite.  This board was from the original Group Buy from April of last year, as shown by the brass weight.  Please ask questions if you need more info.

This bundle includes:

* A **de-built e-white KBD8X MKII** with an **extra black aluminum top**.  A full polycarbonate plate and a used but cleaned and working PCB accompanies the board, with a total of *one* plate and *one* PCB for the board in the bundle.
* A **PCB-Case sound-dampening foam** and a **gummyworm gasket** for the board -- yes, *you can gasket mount the KBD8X MKII!* Just by chance in design, though.  It works just like you expected.
* ~~An~~ **~~e-white KBDPAD MKII~~** ~~with an~~ **~~extra pink top~~**~~,~~ **~~built~~** ~~with Sakurios lubed with 205g0 and some plate-PCB and PCB-case foam.  The caps on this board are from GMK Minimal R1 and the GMK blanks GB --~~ **~~they are included in this bundle.~~**  ~~The pad itself has seldom been used, and the keycaps have no shine at all to it.~~ **SOLD separately.**
* The original box~~es~~ and packaging for ~~both~~ the Board ~~and the Pad~~.

One of the rubber feet of the board is starting to fall off, and while I do have replacements on hand right now (the one in the pictures), they aren't in the same height.  I think I've gotten some proper replicas of the feet in the mail, but that's not going to arrive anytime soon.  I believe the keyboard currently has VIA installed, but I'm not sure if that's truly the case -- just can't remember.  The foam isn't the KBD8X Muting Kit from KBDFans, but from a separate group buy.  **~~Asking $700 + Shipping~~** ~~for this bundle.~~ The bundle has been split -- **Asking $540 + Shipping** for the KBD8X MKII package.

&#x200B;

**Apple M0110 and M0120** \-- Good condition.  Both the board and the numpad is yellowed and unequally. (Check pictures for comparison of the two.)  The switches are Alps SKCC Tall Cream in good condition -- they don't bind and are fine to type on.  [Here's my typing test of it.](https://youtu.be/CTuhQ07Ahzo)  The board and the pad has been cleaned and **tested working**, but a converter isn't included.  This bundle also **includes two original cables** that are a tad dirty, but I don't want to stretch this thing and clean it.  The Caps Lock key is a lock switch, but I've also **included a NOS, never soldered SKCC Short Cream switch to replace the lock switch**, incase you want to use the lock key as a Control, *like it should be* (to some people, anyway).  **Asking $190 Shipped CONUS** for this bundle.

&#x200B;

**~~Alps SKCM Blue x60~~** ~~--  Pristine condition.  60 switches is enough to build a Tsangan/AEK layout 60% keyboard --~~ **~~enough for the upcoming Lunar II~~**~~.  These switches are ready to use.  I'm not the first owner if this batch, so I don't actually know the old condition of this item, but right now it's really darn good!  These are definitely one of the better Alps batches I've had my hands on.  I'd rate these switches an A -- a 9/10.  It's that good.~~  **~~Asking $100 Shipped CONUS~~**~~.~~ **SOLD for asking.**

TX65 | The board is Antique brass, switches are retooled MX blacks with 45g Singa Springs - lubed and switchfilmed. The weight has some minor scratches as well as a scratch on the plate. NOTE!!! The board has a problem being recognized by windows when connecting it. Previous owner claims not to have had this problem so it might be something with my computer. Either way you should assume that you'll have the same issue. The fix though is rather simple by just plugging the cable in again, you might need a few tries but when it's recognized it works flawlessly.

Hey MM!

Today for sale I have some doubleshot PBT keycaps in the BoW and WoB colorway. These come from the same molds and manufacturer as the widely popular NovelKeys BoW and Vaporwave. These are excellent, thick, doubleshot PBT keycaps that have really nice, crisp legends. They also feature 0 warp [https://imgur.com/a/MXUFvRP](https://imgur.com/a/MXUFvRP), unlike a certain GMK WoB keyset.

Note: These are not keycaps from Novelkeys, but are from the same molds and same factory and are the same quality. They're exactly the same, just without the novelkeys branding. Cherry profile.

Hi all, looking to off load some stuff I no longer need or want. My recent work situation changed and I won't have to spend my days in the office, so no need for the Practice65. The Practice65 was built with the intention of being more quiet than a traditional mechanical board so I wouldn't distract others.  

Prices listed below, these prices are for CONUS only and I will most likely be using USPS priority, I have over 100 confirmed trades on HWS. 

Items for sale:

* **Practice65V2:** $145 + shipping. Bought this for use in the office and was cheap enough for giggles. After sourcing quite a few parts, I did some testing to see how quiet I could get it and settled on silent tactile switches. I also band-aid modded the PCB so the sound of the stabilizers would be more muted and added o-ring gaskets above and below the FR4 plate to try to isolate the sound even more. Board was not poorly soldered together, I do have some experience (~6 years) from working with electronics back in college and as a side hobby. Not looking to make a profit on this, tried to price fairly. [Here is a sound test for those that are interested.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoyFyY3_Trk) Keycaps are not included. Note that the plate/pcb can be used for the Stacked65 which is coming out soon if you'd want a nicer case. Price breakdown shown below: 

* Practice65V2 Component | Price
---|---
Practice65V2 Kit | $54 (price after shipping from CannonKeys)
67x Gazzew Boba U4 62g lubed w/ Krytox 203 & GPL 105 | $67
GMK stabs balanced/clipped/lubed w/ Krytox 205g0 & Dielectric Grease | $20
Extras: Rubber bumpons, o-ring gaskets, band-aid mod | $4
Total | $145

* ~~**NK65 Entry Edition - Blumen** $145 + shipping - opened and used for a few hours. Not a fan of the sound from it compared to my other keyboards. Comes with case and USB-C cable from NovelKeys. Stabilizers were balanced/clipped/lubbed with Krytox 205g0 + dielectric grease. Also added fabric tape to the plate to ensure stabilizers did not rattle/shift when mounted.~~ SOLD

* ~~**NK65 Entry Edition - Frost** $135 + shipping - brand new/unopened. Note that the outside box won't fit into a medium flat rate box so it'll most likely be shipped just in the NovelKeys case. If you want the box we can discuss price (it should be about $7 more for the board game box from USPS). If wanted, I can also balance/clip/lube these stabilizers and add fabric tape to the plate to ensure the stabs don't rattle for $10 more.~~ SOLD 

* **87x Unholy Bobas:** $40 shipped - these are silent tactile switches and have not been used/soldered. Made from Halo True housings, springs (lubed with Krytox GPL 105), and Gazzew Boba U4 stems. Factory lube was not cleaned off of housings, so partially lubed switch?

Please comment before PMing. Feel free to shoot me an offer if you think the price is too high.

Please comment before PMing me and sending chat request, without comment chats will be ignored.

NOTE: Selling in a form PRICE + SHIPPING! Aproximate but quite precise prices to EUROPE and U.S. are writen. Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive (because of overseas shipping) and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. To make it easier I simply include shipping and pp fees. EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually","[EU-LT] [H] GMK Dualshot, Zilents V2 (62g), Cherry MX Red, Other Things [W] PayPal"

**~~GMK Oliva++ Light Base - Asking $325 shipped~~**  **SOLD**

* New, Sealed in plastic. NK sticker included with base kit. Original Box has some creases from shipping.  Purchased this off of r/mechmarket as an impulse buy and then decided to go a different direction with keycaps.
* Ships Priority Mail with Tracking and Insurance.

\-------------------

**Black Drop ALT High Profile w/ Gateron Blues, Stupidfish Foam & original Keycaps**

Asking  **$225 shipped** \- [MORE PICS](https://imgur.com/a/3deKrzk)

* Stupidfish Foam laser cut foam installed front and back.  Bandaid modded and swapped in the factory lubed NK65 stabilizers (I put my Cherry Stabs in the NK65 board).
* Includes original USB cable, keycap puller and switch puller. Includes the original (67) Drop Black/Grey shine through keycaps.  Includes stock Gateron Blues (used/pre-owned but never soldered).
* Right now switches and keycaps are not installed. Pics show everything included.
* Board used maybe 12 hours total.  Removed the caps, switches and stabilizers to install the Stupidfish foam.  Then some of my new boards started arriving and this just has been sitting.  Also, I have another board on the way so just making room...  Kind of bummed to let it go but there is only so much space for boards.
* Ships Priority Mail with Tracking and Insurance.

\-------------------

**70x Tactile Frankenswitches (Lubed) -  $85 shipped**

* [Sound Test](https://imgur.com/a/6ZEqK0C)
* C3 Kiwi Stem + Zealio V2 Housing with 67g Gold Spring.  These are like new as the Zealios were purchased recently from KBDFans.  Mounted only a few in hotswap.
* These feel less tactile than the stock Kiwi and stock Zealio.  These feel more tactile than a Cherry MX Clear.  Slightly more tactile feel than an Outemu Silent Sky.
* *Lightly* lubed with Tribosys 3203 (stem sides, front and back - **NOT** the legs).  Springs oiled with 51004.  I lube my tactiles lightly to retain as much tactility as possible while only smoothing out the plastic on plastic contact.
* Ships First Class Mail with Tracking.

\-------------------

**KBD67 MKII Hotswap Foam - Backside only.**  $5 + shipping OR free with any purchase (let me know before invoice is sent)

* Made by Stupidfish.  But already had back foam.  This is for the back side only.  Will ship from 91105.  I can ship however you prefer.

**WANTS**

\- **Cheap Hotswap Macropad or Numpad** \- Looking in the $30 to $50 range.  Yampad would be ideal. Or the YMDK 9 key pad.  Not looking to spend more than $50.  It's for a side project and not for any real use, so not looking too much.

\- **Olivia ++ Dark Deskmat** \- New or Like New

\- **70x - 90x Tactile Lilac Switches** \- Never soldered. Prefer unlubed, but will still consider lubed switches.

Happy Sunday everybody,

Here again to thin out my keyboard backlog. While I'm open to negotiating, I'm pricing these things to sell locally because I'd like them gone sooner rather than later.

Not FCFS. Local preferred and prioritized (Los Angeles/90006). **Please comment before PM, no comment and chats will both be ignored.** Gonna be killing myself over the Laker game tonight so sorry if I'm slow to respond until tomorrow. Thanks a bunch, take care and stay safe!

Item | Price | Notes
:-- | :-- | :--
RAMA M65-A | ~~**$600 local**, $675 shipped & insured~~ **Sold!** | Gray cerakote, Millmax (7305) PCB, no stabs included. I bought it off [this nice guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/itdkh0/usca_h_cerakote_m65a_moon_u80a_artisans_bumens/) about three weeks ago now. It's a fingerprint magnet but it's beautiful. There's a slight issue with the cerakoting (pictured) but it's not noticeable when built. PCB was band aid modded by previous owner, though they're a little worn. **Does not** come in OG box.
Burgundy Tofu65 | ~~**$100 local**, $125 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Hotswap DZ65RGB, alu plate, clipped & lubed GMK(?) pop-in stabs. Plugged the PCB back in again, backspace doesn't work still and the right alt socket straight up fell off (pictured in timestamp). There's also a [ding on the lower left corner](https://imgur.com/Og6UHDi) from previous owner, though it's not very noticeable when typing. Price reflects ding and PCB problems.
Black Tofu65 | ~~**$175 local**, $200 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Hotswap DZ65, brass plate, stupidfish foam in case. Was used for about a week as my girlfriend's daily driver but switched her over to an NK65. Will come with extra unused foam.
Kumo Minivan | ~~**$100 local**, $120 shipped~~ **Sold!** | USB-C, VIA compatible, Kailh hotswap sockets. Will come with board, stock caps, USB-C cable, and holster/case. **No switches included but PM if you'd like to buy some with it.**
MT3 Susuwatari | ~~**$150 local**, $170 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Base and extras, no Jiji novelty. Previous owner used for about a week, probably got less than an hour of use out of me.
GMK Paperwork | ~~**$130 local**, $150 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Great kit, just getting rid of all my 40% stuff.

Hi guys,

I want to sell my black Tofu 60% Hotswap buyed on 25th august, cause it was my first custom keeb and i noticed i really prefer the 65% layout with arrows, and as you can see from the timestamp i moved already to the 65% layout.

Anyway this is the build :

\- KBDfans Tofu 60% aluminum case × 1

\- DZ60RGB-ANSI v2  PCB HOTSWAP × 1

\-  Brass 60% plate × 1 ( with adesive KBD module foam)

\- DZ60RGB-ANSI Case Foam × 1

\-  GMK Screw-in Stabilizers × 1 ( with  KBDfans Stabilizers foam sticker and lubed with Superlube grease)

\-   Novelkey x Kailh Linear Cream Switch x61 (lubed with krytox)

&#x200B;

I really prefer to sell all the bundle keyboard + switches and im looking for 270€ plus shipping ( around 10€ in EU) , that is the price i payed without the customs fees. Only EU buyers.

Selling GMK Olivia ++ light base kit. I dont have any boards to put this on and with other sets coming, I really don't have anywhere to put it. So I've decided to sell it.

£250 +  shipping

Would like to stick to just UK but I will be willing to ship to the rest of EU if you cover shipping fee. 


Please comment PM'd or similar so I know you are interested and can see you messaged me.

Edit:
As I've only had international enquiries so far, I will consider it over the next couple of days. I have been reluctant to do so though, as I've experienced alot of delays with international shipping recently. If someone from the UK wants to snatch these up today or tomorrow, great!

BIG UPDATE, NEW PRICES.

Hello r/mechmarket,

About an hour ago I realized I needed to clean up and get rid of stuff that I am not using and don't plan on using. Let's start off with a few simple things:

Comment before PM, chat will be ignored, there is a link to pm me in the bot comment.

All prices are OR BEST OFFER (where BEST OFFER is BELOW ASKING PRICE), I really just need to move stuff. Shipping to CONUS only. Bundles are preferred and come with discounts!

Onward with the items.

**Acrylic Tofu - $100 shipped**

* pc plate included

**~~Cherry MX Reds - $20 shipped~~**

* ~~stock 5 pin, have been desoldered~~

**massdrop hangul pbt keycaps - $30 shipped**

* the kuro shiro keycap is not included, to make the hangul pbt set work the board needs to be configured in standard 6.25u ANSI layout

DESOLDERED THE TOFU AND SPLIT APART

**Wyse WY-30 Keycaps - 40 shipped (PENDING)**

* pulled from a board I desoldered, I have the rest of the board as well but I figured the keycaps would probably be the thing people might want, I have no idea what these are worth.
* The B key is the only keycap that had damage I saw when pulling it apart. included a picture of the scratch

**~~Gateron Ink (65ish) READ DESC - $55 shipped~~**

~~\* these were lubed (by me) with Tribosys 3204 and filmed with deskeys films and spring swapped with TX 65g springs (lubed with tx oil)~~ ~~\*~~ **~~They were soldered in a board, desoldered, and then resoldered, and then desoldered again. some of the switch tabs (clip into plate tabs) are bent inward but they pull out with a pair of tweezers. priced accordingly. Do not use these for a hotswap board.~~**

**~~Cherry switch parts - $30 shipped~~**

* ~~a lot of 3 pin housings, I used them for playing with UHMWPE in a 3 pin hotswap board. I do not know how many are there exactly but it's more than enough for 1 board~~
* ~~some 5 pin housings and mx reds (top bag) don't know exact number but not many in there trying to bundle together~~

**~~ThicThock MP 68g and 64g springs - $15 shipped~~**

* ~~brand new (only used to try) MP 68 springs, full count is there (100)~~

Hey MM!

Today for sale I have some doubleshot PBT keycaps in the BoW and WoB colorway. These come from the same molds and manufacturer as the widely popular NovelKeys BoW and Vaporwave. These are excellent, thick, doubleshot PBT keycaps that have really nice, crisp legends.

Note: These are not keycaps from Novelkeys, but are from the same molds and same factory and are the same quality. They're exactly the same, just without the novelkeys branding. Cherry profile.

US and canada only , canada will be using first class international and there will be an additional shipping fee. keycaps and switches shipped in bags, with foam padding.

Bundles get Priority shipping. Single sets will be shipping with USPS first class.

Hi folks, I have a Duck Octagon V3 up for trade in Silver. If you really must have it, then it is going for 700 shipped worldwide tracked.

But fair warning I am seriously looking for a trade.

If you are looking for more affordable boards this might not be for you (or for your first board). For one, the typing angle is pretty steep and will punish poor typing posture, second of all, there are plenty of upcoming GBs if you're looking for an entry level board; and lastly, a 75% layout might not be your cup of tea if coming from a traditional 1800 style layout. That being said, the octagon is a beautiful board with a pleasant character of its own. It's just not worth the price (imo) I've listed it at.

TL;DR, Looking for trades, very keen on trying out the LZ MP/ 1.2 in person.

Specs:
Polycarbonate plate;
Original Duck PCB mill maxed 7305 by a local builder, in full working condition. Able to provide sound test (currently using it with H1s lubed 205g0 spring swapped to 60g SPIRIT progressive springs lubed 105 filmed with black TX films) and key map tests if requested. 

Comes with snipped GMK stabs, wire tuned, lubed with 205g0.- Able to provide per key LED as well but not soldered.

[W]Key65, Silver LZ MP+pp built or unbuilt is fine, but if built, preferably with mx retooled blacks. Navy/ Black Matrix 1.2OG, same as above. Will offer up (verified) pp on my end!

Thanks for viewing and have a great day ahead :)","[SG] [H] Duck Octagon V3, Verified PP [W], LZ MP, Orion V3, Verified PP"

Built with Creams lubed with 205g0 and Zeal Stabs Lubed with 205g0 on a brass plate. The board will come with an extra brass plate, an aluminum plate. a POM plate and a spare PCB.

The board is A stock and spotless.

[GLAMOUR SHOT OF THIS BEAUTIFUL KEYBOARD](https://i.imgur.com/UDcOTBe.jpg)

[TIMESTAMPS](https://imgur.com/a/gsZOyor)

**RAMA WORKS x Wilba.tech Thermal -  $1000 OBO** in the MIST color (silver) with the full layout and the hotswap PCB.  I did build it immediately after receiving it.  Currently it has Novelkeys Cream switches lubed with Krytox 205g0 and Equalz C3 Olivia edition stabilizers.  I did have to remove one switch during the build and it was quite the pain in the ass so it left a few marks on the silver plate around one switch and for that reason I'd rather sell it with the switches and stabs than remove them.

**GMK Mizu Base - $400** [PENDING SALE] this set was used probably a week total.  Saved it for this exact build (as you can probably tell) but at this point I'd rather buy 2 more PBT keycap sets that I'm not afraid to use daily.  Will include the GMK tray and box.

**GMK Mizu x Rama Artisan - $130 OBO** [PENDING SALE] this was actually never used at all.  Not sure what these typically go for so willing to take best offer or preferably add on with the base set or keyboard.

**Custom Finalmouse Air58 - $220 OBO** - again, not sure what this is actually worth, but never seen another one like it before.  Had the custom shell made by Space-Caps back in 2019 but by the time the shell had arrived I had moved to the smaller Cape-town mouse from them.  Also has a grey scale cable on it.



I'd prefer to bundle all this if possible, so if you're interested in it all shoot me a PM and we can try to work something out.

* **Everything is new** unless stated otherwise.
* Prices don’t include shipping unless stated otherwise.
* Only shipping CONUS for now.
* Pm first.
* Not necessarily fcfs.
* Bundles / trades get priority.
* Prefer to ship keysets in bags. I know that sucks, but it's a lot cheaper and I don't have big boxes that fit GMK sets.  If you really want your GMK Box, we can work something out.
* I'll try to reply to everyone, but if it gets overwhelming I""ll just update this thread.
* Might be open to trades, doesn’t hurt to ask.

Asking 300 USD for both. 

Pinoko v2 switches x68. Translucent pink JWK Linears with full polycarb housings. Stock and unused. 
Asking 70 USD 

Mill-Max 7305 sockets. Tell me how many you need. Have around 400. 

Have some extra POM plates for the kbd67v2 mkii. 
Asking 40 USD. 

Kbd67 V2 mkii Hotswap plate
Asking 55 USD. Sold

Ordered way too much of an acoustic sound dampening material. It's 2mm thick, should fit a few cases. It's graded to isolate 26dB with a single layer. It's quite dense and will legitimately add weight to your build as it's reasonably heavy for its size. From a local sound specialist. 
Asking 25 USD for a 60/65 size. 

For anyone willing to do a bank transfer or bundles. Can give a discount on price.","[EU-UK] [H] GMK Phosphorous, Rama Kuro Shiro Artisans, Pinoko v2 switches, Mill-Max 7305, KBD67 V2 mkii POM + brass plates, Sound dampening material [W] PayPal"

Each set comes with 1x 6.25U and 4x 2U.


They will come in the original packaging with screws and will be shipped in a bubble-wrap envelope. Priority can go to whoever wants to grab both sets together.


Please comment before PM'ing, will not read reddit chats*

Not sure what's a fair price for these but judging on recent sales I'm going to set it at $300 USD shipped. Also open for pickup if you live Northside of Melbourne (I'm on the South Morang line).",[AU] [H] GMK Nautilus + Spacebar kit + Novelties Sealed [W] Paypal

Hi all,

looking to sell a couple of items to eventually fund myself an HBCP.

&#x200B;

1. \[$265USD / $345CAD\] **GMK Olivia ++ Dark Base kit.** Still sealed. I bought both the light and dark sets and ended up keeping the light base as I have many more dark GMK sets coming in soon. Would trade for sealed GMK Olive. If opened, I would still be interested with a bit of paypal on your end.
2. \[$750USD / $1000CAD\] **Percent Studio Canoe Gen 2 Casio limited edition**. Still sealed in original packaging. This guy took waaaay too long and I have already committed to a dozen other 65% boards. Would possibly trade for any interesting boards.

Shipping is **not included in the price**, but will split the shipping 50/50 with Canadians.   
Trade preference goes to BC>Canada>NA>Rest of the world

Please comment before PM.

Hello, r/mm!

I'm selling a 40% ortho build, lube station, and 60% sleeve. Details below.

**40%:** Here are the specs and price breakdown (for the board, I'm not really looking to split the parts):

Shark PCB (Like the Planck rev6, but soldered and south-facing): USB-C, QMK, ortho. MIT layout right now, but also supports Grid and 2x2U if you desolder the space bar (would need a different plate, though). Love this PCB, but I have 2 so I'm selling this build and starting another for myself. Compatible with Planck cases, I soldered the necessary standoffs. Will include the M2 screws. - $50

Plate: Brass, sandblasted, 1.5 mm from LaserBoost. Really nice plate. Cost 44 Euros + shipping from Spain, so I figure - $55

Foam: has plate foam from MKUltra installed (between plate and PCB). Does not have case foam under the PCB because the one I got is 4mm, and was too thick. The USB port was too close to the case and you couldn't plug the board in. You could get the 2mm version also from MKUltra or cut it yourself if you really wanted case foam - $5

Case: Space Grey Hi-Pro aluminum Planck case - $30

Switches: 67g Zilents V2, lubed with 3203, springs lubed with GPL 105. - $50

~~Keycaps: GMK Red Samurai Ortho. Used less than a month. Will include entire kit (keys not mounted will ship in bags with the board) - $70~~ Edit: Keycaps will no longer be included. Board fully built except for caps. Price reduced accordingly.

Shipping/PayPal fees: 10$ to US.

~~Total for board: $200 shipped.~~ Board parted out.

Note about board: The 2U spacebar does not have a stabilizer. I don't think it needs one, and the creator of the Planck doesn't recommend it, so I figured I wouldn't deal with silencing a stab for this build. If you wanted to add one you'd have to desolder the whole thing. Like I said, though, feels just fine without it.

**Sleeve:** From Keyboard Wear, feels pretty good quality. Sized for 60% board. All black, velcro, outside cable pocket. Got this for a Tofu build I did but by the time it arrived I'd moved on to ortho. Never used. - ~~$30 shipped.~~ Sold in bumped post.

**Lube Station:** Gray, from KBDFans. Holds 35 switches. Used during one build. - ~~$25 shipped.~~ Sold $20 shipped.

Let me know if you have any questions, and please comment before PM (no chat, please, I can't use chat on this app).

Thank you.","[US-MO] [H] Fully Built Ortho 40%, KBDFans Gray Lubing Station, Keyboard Wear 60% Sleeve [W] PayPal"

I prefer to do US shipping, but not necessarily a deal breaker. I may have to adjust prices for shipping internationally.

I am looking to get rid of some things to free up space and money. US only on sales/trades. Comment before PM. The bot will put a nice little ""send a pm to this user"" link that you can use on mobile. all prices are ""or best offer"" (lower than asking).

I'll start with the Tofu

**Acrylic Tofu**

\- PC plate

\- Cherry Mx Reds (stock, 5 pin)

\- GMK Stabs (mixed clip in and screw in, lubed but still noisy since they were lubed by previous owner and I haven't touched them)

\- 1up RGB 60% USB C pcb (jumped on TAB key, been desoldered at least 4 times)

\- Massdrop Hangul PBT keycaps ([https://drop.com/buy/hangul-pbt-dye-subbed-keycaps-set](https://drop.com/buy/hangul-pbt-dye-subbed-keycaps-set)), I have the full set but with the split right shift the keycaps don't work (6.25u ANSI only), **THE KURO SHIRO CAP IS NOT INCLUDED**

it's a beater board, I used it to break in some switches and I didn't bother getting a hotswap pcb. I know this needs work to make usable but would be a good project for someone looking for one.

Asking $160 shipped w/ full keycap set

for the artisans, the prices listed are retail (what I paid) plus shipping (to you). if it says ""trades"" I will prioritize trades. bundles are nice and save you some bucks.

**E6-V2 - $350** SOLD

The board is built with Tealios V2, lubed with Tribosys 3204, with lubed authentic GMK stabilizers. Split backspace. The extra propeitary PCB is included. The top and bottom piece have been cerakoted white (Cerakote Snow White), and the mid-piece is brass. Please note that white cerakote is prone to imperfections when looking closely, so this is not for those seeking absolute perfection in their metal boards, however I think it looks quite stunning with the brass mid-piece and the right keyset. The brass has also tarnished a bit, which is normal for brass and can be restored by you if you so choose. Does not come with original packaging. Bottom LEDs likely need to be replaced if you are interested in using them. Does NOT come with keycaps. Will be shipped securely with lots of padding.",[US-VA] [H] E6-V2 [W] PayPal

For sale / trade is a black MGA standard with sneakbox pcb, black pom plate, h1s lubed with 205g0 and tx filmed, and lubed durock stabs, although I don't remember what with. Only flaws: 1. the board has is a small ding that came new with the board on the front of the bottom, only visible from the bottom, last picture has a close-up. 2. The left spacebar stabilizer conked out on me at some point and was replaced, and the replacement is less well lubed than the others.

[Timestamps](https://imgur.com/a/q1BUoBf)

 I'm selling my Space65. Smoothest keyboard I've ever owned but it's rarely used due to my preference for tactile switches.

What's included:

\- Space65 R1 (Gray) with red badge and original packaging and accessories

\- Carbon fiber plate with Gateron Ink Blacks, lubed with Krytox 205G0

\- Tiffany C3 stabs (full kit), also lubed with Krytox 205G0

\- Second unused PCB (tested on 10/5)

\- GMK Red Samurai (full 65% set from [Drop.com](https://drop.com/)) **PENDING**

\- Red Samurai coiled aviator cable from Luxecables **PENDING**

Only blemish I can see is a tiny nick on the left side of the case near the Tab key (pictured). Otherwise it's in fantastic shape. Prefer to sell together as I don't have another keeb with the Red Samurai bottom row layout, but will consider separating them if I get interest for the keycaps and the aviator cable as a combo.

**Asking $675 shipped or $650 local (37221) for the keyboard and extra PCB.**

As always, please comment before PM'ing. Thanks for looking and stay safe everyone!","[US-TN] [H] Space65 R1, Extra PCB, GMK Red Samurai, Luxecables Red Samurai Coiled Aviator USB-C Cable [W] Paypal, Local Cash"

Blobbert artisan keycap. This was included in a keyboard purchase and I’m not into artisans. $90 shipped

GMK 80s Kid Minivan keyset. Only enough to fill a minivan. There is quite a bit of shine. They fit great on box switches. They were somewhat loose on my alpacas. *****They have a chance of being loose on any non box switches*****. $80 shipped

Silver aluminum B-Stock minivan. Soldered lubed/filmed alpacas. Has some craft foam under pcb. Nickel plate. Just bought, but 40s are more aesthetic to me than practical use. B stock because mill went a little crazy on bottom right corner. $150 shipped

Tada 68 with sorbathaned plastic case, and gateron blacks, no keycaps. Weighs 1.5lbs $80

Just66 (ca66 clone) custom cnc’d with zebrano wood, steel back plate and mounting plate, mounted with silicon o-rings. Just66 pcb customizable with ydkb configurator online. Cherry stabs, clipped and lubed, switches are vintage cherry housings with 60g 1up springs, gateron yellow stems, and 205g0 lube. The back plate has sorbathane applied to further silence the case. A lot of money went into this build, however it did crack a bit due to warping, its been glued, and is now stable. The cracks are on the  flat edges, and are not visible during use. Given all these factors, I’m going to start at $380. This is well below cost, but I’m open to offers, looking to sell. Keep in mind it weighs 3.75lbs

Hello mechmarket !

All prices are OBO, **do not hesitate to shoot any offer.**

Prices do not include shipping, they will be calculated on a case-per-case basis. I have some pretty cheap shipping options in France, even for heavy items and international shipping, but keep in mind COVID made them a bit more expensive tho.

Sound test of KBD19x (w/ GMK WoB): [https://imgur.com/a/E68XTIm](https://imgur.com/a/E68XTIm)

~~For the Wyse ABS Doubleshot caps: They are very well used, nice and shiny, from 1991. The J key needs to be retrobrighted. I cleaned the caps with warm soapy water and let them dry for a good few days.~~ **~~Would like 15GBP + shipping. Can ship worldwide.~~**  **SOLD**

&#x200B;

~~For the~~ **~~KBD19x~~**~~: The board I got from KBDfans a month or two ago when I found that they were still in stock (at the time). I built the board initially with the~~ **~~alpacas (205g0 lubed, 0.15mm TX filmed)~~**~~, but the brass plate just wasn't doing it for me. I took a reciprocating saw (the dremel took too long to cut the brass) and~~ **~~DIY cut the plate into a half-plate~~**~~. The point of a half plate is to make the board feel softer, more flexy and improve the acoustics.~~

~~There are absolutely no blemishes or even scratches on the board as far as I can see, but there are a few marks on the plate from when I was dremelling. You can't notice it with keycaps on, and imo it doesn't even look that bad without them, since there is already a big contrast with the white PCB and the brass plate. Also note that F1-F10 have Gateron ink black switches, lubed 205g0 and TX filmed, 67g SPRiT springs.~~

~~This board has been successfully ported to VIA thanks to MechMerlin (where the hex file will be released with his kbd19x review, stay posted on his youtube channel for that), and the board sounds really amazing. Very nice and 'poppy', really good for a top mount board.~~

~~Kit: 260GBP~~

~~Import Tax: 70GBP~~

**All cables are $50 shipped CONUS.  Willing to bundle if you want more cables since that'll save on shipping costs.  Also willing to trade two cables for a GMK 8008 Accent Set as that's the last set I need for my birthday present to myself :)**

**\~\~\~General Disclaimers\~\~\~**

* All cables below have a \~6in coil and a \~4ft host end with a GX16 4-pin connector and are USB-A to USB-C being fully compliant with USB standards.  Most end up being about 6.5"" as far as the coil and the host ends may be up to a foot longer than 4'. We're still working out the kinks as far as consistency goes on getting precise lengths.
* All coils are coiled and heated by hand and are reverse coiled to provide a much tighter and longer lasting coil **DISCLAIMER:** We do not recommend excessive/repeated stretching of the coils.  The coils are solely for aesthetic purposes and while we are proud of our final product, we cannot guarantee that they will withstand multiple and/or long stretching. Please mess with them at your own risk.
* You will receive the exact cable shown in the table below!
* All cables made with 28 gauge power conductors.  They perfectly power my KBD75 and her Tofu60 but we cannot guarantee it will supply full power to high power boards.  We have a Drop CTRL coming soon that we will be able to start testing with, however, as far as these cables go please be aware that your LEDs may be dimmer with our cables (your keyboard will still work, it'll just affect LED brightness).

Heya. Doing some housecleaning on the topre side of the collection. Also looking for any GMK sets in my wants list.

If you have any questions, feel free to PM.

**For Sale:**

Item | Price | Avail? | Notes
----|-----|-----| -----
Realforce 87U 10th Anniversary 55g | $330 shipped & insured | ✔️ | Used. Minor to moderate shine on WASD alphas. Shine on case near spacebar and arrow keys. No shine on OEM ABS spacebar; it was never used. Includes extras keys and red esc pictured in album. Original packaging is also included. This is the limited edition 87U with the gray/blue keycaps and gray (not black) Realforce case.
Idea23 HHKB HiPro caps | $50 shipped | ✔️ | These are some serious C-stock caps. They are unfortunately yellowed from sun damage, and when I removed the set for cleaning, the enter key and a black alpha snapped their stems. Left shift and enter already had a missing stem half; I will include the snapped ones in the picture for anybody who wants to attempt epoxying or gluing them to repair. Set will be given a good rinse before sale; otherwise sold as-is. Price is set low to reflect the condition, but fair offers will be entertained. Cardboard tray not included (it doesn't fit the caps when closed.)

Looking to clear out some inventory and pass on some things that weren't getting used.

&#x200B;

* **Tada68 w/ Box Jades** \- **$150 + Shipping** \- Dark Grey Alu case, clipped/lubbed/band-aided GMK screw-in stabs. Does **not** come with keycaps. Also worth noting these Box Jades were purchased pre-retooling to correct stretching/cracking issues. I've had ePBT caps on them for about 2 years and haven't seen any signs of this happening but YMMV.
* **Mini-USB Pexon Cable** \- **$25 + Shipping** \- Uses 6-pin aviation style connector, blue + grey sleeving w/ black heat shrink. Pairs nicely w/ Tada :)
* **Drawstring Travel Cover - $5 + Shipping -** Came with a different board I purchased, have no use for the cover. Doesn't provide much in the way of protection other than from dirt/dust.
* **Filco SA Keycap Set - $50 + Shipping -** Double-shot ABS SA profile, 104-key set. Didn't see much use so not much shine to them.
* **~~B&W /~~** **Color Grab Bag** **- $10** **~~each, $15 together~~** **+ Shipping -** Random assortment of caps from a grab bag purchased off this sub a while ago. Good for filling up a macro pad / switch tester. **- Edit: B&W bag sold.**
* **Holtites - $10 + Shipping -** Bought with the intention of making the Tada hot-swap, couldn't get them to work for me. Enough to fill up a 65% board.
* **O-Rings - $5 + Shipping** **-** Have had these for a while and never liked the feel of them. Not super stiff.

Hi guys, prioritizing CONUS for now, all prices include shipping to CONUS addresses. No trades please.

**E6-V2** - $380 

Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/a2VyrZX?s=fbm&fbclid=IwAR25-BEFwJWPu9qQIL42TiXDiEBA8PU5cuuZNU8DLIKRELOELFWsKim7OXw

The board is built with Tealios V2, lubed with Tribosys 3204, with lubed authentic GMK stabilizers. Split backspace. The extra propeitary PCB is included. The top and bottom piece have been cerakoted white, and the mid-piece is brass. Please note that white cerakote is prone to imperfections when looking closely, so this is not for those seeking absolute perfection in their metal boards, however I think it looks quite stunning with the brass mid-piece and the right keyset. The brass has also tarnished a bit, which is normal for brass and can be restored by you if you so choose. Does not come with original packaging. Bottom LEDs likely need to be replaced if you are interested in using them. Does NOT come with keycaps. Will be shipped securely with lots of padding.

**QXP** - SOLD

Built with Healios V2, DZ60 PCB, lubed with Tribosys 3204, with lubed authentic GMK stabilizers. Split backspace. Cerakoted gray. While not as prone to visible imperfections as the white, cerakote will have some imperfections compared to anodized aluminium. Does NOT come with keycaps. Does not come with original packaging.

I am selling my e white tofu 60% because I no longer need it, this was my first ever custom keyboard and have upgraded since then. The case is perfect there is no scratches on it. The tofu comes with a gk64 hotswap pcb, cream switches that were lubed with krytox 204g0, an aluminum plate, mkultra case and plate foam, and lubed gmk stabilizers. The plate has some scratches by one of the screw holes but other than that it is fine.

I've used this board for about 2 months and have decided that the board is not for me. The sound is good, but I don't think it's what I'm looking for. [Here is a sound test with Matt3o MT3 /dev/tty keycaps.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WItq9eMfKEM) The board can be de-soldered and split, but preference will go to those who inquire about the built board.

Looking to sell two boards that I no longer can justify keeping. I have just recently moved, and would rather put this money towards new furniture :) All sales will be shipped through USPS and CONUS only. Please comment before PM. 

• Fjell - $600 shipped. Perfect condition, really hurts to let this one go. Sounds and feels amazing, but 60% is just not for me. Has a HS pcb, TYL 4mm brass plate, 205g0 lubed GMK stabs on all keys aside from spacebar which is a 205g0 lubed durock stab (7u). Can include 205g0 lubed zealios v2’s that are currently installed for additional $. 

• KBD67MKI - THIS IS NOT THE MKII. $225 shipped. Great condition, only flaw is that one of the rear screws will not fully screw in. Comes with a HS pcb, 205g0 lubed zeal stabs, and 2 plates (brass and alum). 

Both boards have case foam installed as well.","[US-AZ] [H] Black HS Fjell R4, Blue HS KBD67MKI [W] PayPal"

Unloading some things that don't/won't see use. All prices include shipping. This is not fcfs, bundles, trades, and local will be prioritized. My responses may be delayed as I am working on my house at the moment. 


I have arbitrarily set my prices, so if they are bad feel free to offer what you see fit.

~~[gateron fei](https://i.imgur.com/9oUkwMk.jpg) - 74x - $30~~ SOLD



**Board/numpad**



~~[kbdpad](https://imgur.com/a/hf3F5Bt) - this is the first version. Was gonna refinish it but it wasn't worth the effort. 99% sure a screw or two are stripped on it. It's also not in the best shape. It works though. Has some dampening crap in it from the previous owner. Was built with cherry stabs and linjars w/cream stems. - $55~~ SOLD


~~[Eve wkl moon](https://i.imgur.com/6QaMpfo.jpg) - I bought this board a few months ago but I own two moons. I don't need two moons. A previous owner had [filed around the usb port](https://imgur.com/a/uoQh6zm) to accommodate a fixed cable. Not the prettiest, but not noticable when in use. It is currently built with red inks that were spring swapped to 63.5g sprits. I have an additional plate/new pcb for it that it could come with, or it can come built. I'm flexible on it. - trades for other boards (65s, tkl, 1800s)~~ TRADED","[US-IL] [H] eve moon, camping r2, kbdpad, nk vaporwave, switches [W] PayPal, trades"

The sale item for today is a Levinson Split Keyboard built with Holy Pandas. It's a super nice build but I've taken to Alice layouts lately and don't see myself using it as much. My loss is your gain as this is being sold at less than original cost.

Specs:

Holy Pandas lubed with 205g0 and 67g springs lubed

Top layer / Bottom layer: Black Acrylic

Mid Layer: frosted acrylic

Stretchy / Nice TRRS cable :)

Type C input type

RGB Lights in mid layer

Hairline fractures on a couple corners that were fixed with some super glue / sanding. Pictured last in gallery.

Hello,

First up is an E-White NK65 V2. I used this board for around 13 days, it works perfectly and has no external flaws. There are a few very minor scratches on the plate from my switch puller, but they are covered once switches are placed into the board. It comes with the cable and carrying case it came with, too. The only thing I did to the board itself was take the stabs out and re-lube them since the factory lube was basically nonexistent. Asking $250 shipped CONUS

Second, a base set of GMK Analog Dreams and the novelties. The set was mounted and used lightly for around a month. No shine has formed on any of the caps either. Asking $235 shipped for base, $65 shipped for novelties, or $265 shipped for both, all CONUS. BOTH SETS SOLD

If you're a madlad and want both, I'll do $480 shipped CONUS.

Hello! I am looking to sell a couple boards I have, as well as a set of GMK keycaps. All prices are OBO. Details in the table below:

Item | Info | Price
:--|:--:|--:
E-White KBD67 | Flawless E-white body, solder PCB build with BSUN Holy Pandas on an aluminum plate. Great board! I am switching to a hotswap build, however, as I have had the itch lately to try out a million different switches :-) | $500 OBO
Acrylic Tofu60 | Solder DZ60 PCB, built with Zealios v2 67g on a carbon fiber plate; 60% for factor isn't for me, I am realizing, so I am moving on from this build | $270 OBO
GMK Coral | Brand new! Never mounted, and only touched by me to adjust the few caps that jostled around during shipping; only opened to confirm contents and get a first-hand look at the colors of the set. Will ship with box and trays. | $260 OBO

Thems the goods! You'll also see a PC KBD67 in the top corner of the timestamp. If you are interested in the board but would prefer the PC case over the e-white, let me know and we can talk about that as well! Additionally, if you're interested in the GMK Peaches and Cream set currently on the board in the timestamps, let me know and we can talk about that as well. :)

Prices above don't include shipping, but I usually try to be reasonable in that regard, and I don't mind splitting high shipping costs with the buyer. PM me if you are interested! Thanks!","[US-KY][H] E-White KBD67, Acrylic Tofu60, GMK Coral [W] Paypal, local cash, trades"

Hello ! Too many keysets, moving down to 60%, and in need of money so time to sell some things.

All prices are OBO, **do not hesitate to shoot any offer.**

Prices do not include shipping, they will be calculated / negociated on a case-per-case basis. Keep in mind I have some pretty cheap shipping options in France, even for heavy items and international shipping.

I will prioritise EU buyers for ease of shipping / skipping import taxes for them as I already paid them.

Additional imgur albums are available for most items.

The board I got from KBDfans a month or two ago when I found that they were still in stock (at the time). I built the board initially with the alpacas (205g0 lubed, 0.15mm TX filmed), but the brass plate just wasn't doing it for me. I took a reciprocating saw (the dremel took too long to cut the brass) and DIY cut the plate into a half-plate. The point of a half plate is to make the board feel softer, more flexy and improve the acoustics.

There are absolutely no blemishes or even scratches on the board as far as I can see, but there are a few marks on the plate from when I was dremelling. You can't notice it with keycaps on, and imo it doesn't even look that bad without them, since there is already a big contrast with the white PCB and the brass plate. Also note that F1-F10 have Gateron ink black switches, lubed 205g0 and TX filmed, 67g SPRiT springs.

This board has been successfully ported to VIA thanks to MechMerlin (where the hex file will be released with his kbd19x review, stay posted on his youtube channel for that), and the board sounds really amazing. Very nice and 'poppy', really good for a top mount board.

**THE ROUGH PRICES I PAID FOR EVERYTHING:**

Kit: 260GBP

Switches: 90GBP

Import Tax: 70GBP

TOTAL: 420GBP

 **I think that 420GBP + SHIPPING is very fair. I can ship worldwide.**

Hello r/mechmarket, I hope you're enjoying your weekend so far! I'm selling some of my previous builds and some other parts today to help offset a keeb purchase I just made.

|Item|Description|Want|
|:-|:-|:-|
|[Airforce Blue Aluminum Tofu 60% Build](https://imgur.com/a/TLJZUng)|Band-aid modded DZ60RGBv2 ANSI hotswap pcb, black aluminum plate, Stupidfish case & plate foam, cherry clip in stabilizers. The case itself is flawless since it was only used for a week or so and plate has tiny scratches from removing switches. The spacebar and backspace are genuine Cherry stabilizers, rest are generic stabs. Unfortunately, I only had those stabs on hand so I'd suggest replacing them.|$210 Shipped|
|[~~Acrylic Tofu 60% Build~~](https://imgur.com/a/QiYyEqB)|~~Band-aid modded Instant60 hotswap pcb with RGB underglow and warm white backlight and KBDFans brass plate. The case is in great condition although a~~ [~~little piece of the port cutout broke off~~](https://imgur.com/eGeLq0y) ~~when I was inserting the pcb in wrongly. This doesn't affect functionality at all and isn't even noticeable when plugged in.~~|~~$170 Shipped~~|
|[~~Rubber O-Ring Gasket~~](https://imgur.com/czPbWVB)|~~Bought this gasket-mount the Tofu but didn't have the courage to dremel my PCB.~~|~~Free with first Tofu purchase~~|

|[KBD67V2 MKII Brass Plate](https://imgur.com/q7dHrGk)|Hotswap version with standoffs installed. Good condition with no noticeable scratches|$50 Shipped|
|[80x Durock Gold-plated 62g Springs](https://imgur.com/q7dHrGk)|Harvested from Durock Linears, same springs inside Alpacas. $10 for both if bundled with Black Ink springs.|$7 Stamped mail or +$3 for tracked|

Hello there, relatively new to the hobby but already have too much stuff, lul. Getting rid of some items I don't need at the moment, including some TKC Kiwis and some MiTo Laser switches, for those out there getting ready for their GMK Laser sets. I'm a linear guy but I thought some quality tactiles like Kiwis would win me over, but I just can't swap over from my slidey boys.

The artisans are brand new and haven't been touched, the one in the timestamp is from my other keyboard, which I may be selling soon. Only 125 of each were made. The MiTo Laser switches are being lubed just after this post goes up, using Krytox 205g0 for the stems and housing.

Heya. Once again doing some housecleaning on the topre side of the collection. 

Also looking for GMK Firefly and GMK Korean Beige via trade or cash.


If you have any questions, feel free to PM.

Item | Price | Avail? | Notes
----|-----|-----| -----
Realforce 87U 10th Anniversary 55g | $330 shipped & insured | ✔️ | Used. Minor to moderate shine on WASD alphas. Shine on case near spacebar and arrow keys. No shine on OEM ABS spacebar; it was never used. Includes extras keys and red esc pictured in album. Original packaging is also included. This is the limited edition 87U with the gray/blue keycaps and gray (not black) Realforce case.
Idea23 HHKB HiPro caps | $50 shipped | ✔️ | These are some serious C-stock caps. They are unfortunately yellowed from sun damage, and when I removed the set for cleaning, the enter key and a black alpha snapped their stems. Left shift and enter already had a missing stem half; I will include the snapped ones in the picture for anybody who wants to attempt epoxying or gluing them to repair. Set will be given a good rinse before sale; otherwise sold as-is. Price is set low to reflect the condition, but fair offers will be entertained.

I have a space gray aluminum badge version think6.5. The condition is very good and there are no scratches on the weight or the body of the case. It's a solder pcb and built with 67g zealios lubed with 3204. Lubed pink C3 stabs. Gold PVD Brass weight and badge. Lighting works on the PCB as well. Comes with original packaging. Let me know if you want more pictures or have any questions.

Looking for 800USD~ (if you think ^(ill be here all week guys) this price is bogus then just offer me something lower, I wont be offended), I prefer to ship within north america but I can ship elsewhere as well, just know that it probably costs a lot more. I am willing to take some trades + paypal depending on what you have so throw it my way.

I am looking to buy some Alice plates, like aluminum or brass ones or carbon fibre. Not looking for softer plates.

Also looking for some bright and flashy gmk sets as well as ramas. Nothing in particular so just offer me what you got and ill see if im interested.

Also looking for some more 65g lubed zealios but forgot to put it in the title lol :c","[CA-AB] [H] Think 6.5 Alu Badge Space Gray [W] Paypal, Alice Plates, Flashy GMK Sets, Ramas"

Hi guys, prioritizing CONUS for now, all prices include shipping to CONUS addresses. No trades please.

**E6-V2** - $430 OBO

Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/a2VyrZX?s=fbm&fbclid=IwAR25-BEFwJWPu9qQIL42TiXDiEBA8PU5cuuZNU8DLIKRELOELFWsKim7OXw

The board is built with Tealios V2, lubed with Tribosys 3204, with lubed authentic GMK stabilizers. Split backspace. The extra propeitary PCB is included. The top and bottom piece have been cerakoted white, and the mid-piece is brass. Please note that white cerakote is prone to imperfections when looking closely, so this is not for those seeking absolute perfection in their metal boards, however I think it looks quite stunning with the brass mid-piece and the right keyset. The brass has also tarnished a bit, which is normal for brass and can be restored by you if you so choose. Does not come with original packaging. Bottom LEDs likely need to be replaced if you are interested in using them. Does NOT come with keycaps. Will be shipped securely with lots of padding.

**QXP** - $400 OBO

Built with Healios V2, DZ60 PCB, lubed with Tribosys 3204, with lubed authentic GMK stabilizers. Split backspace. Cerakoted gray. While not as prone to visible imperfections as the white, cerakote will have some imperfections compared to anodized aluminium. Does NOT come with keycaps. Does not come with original packaging. Will be shipped securely with lots of padding.","[US-VA] [H] E6-V2, QXP [W] PayPal"

Hey everyone. This has been just sitting in a corner without much attention. I decided once and for all to sell it. I'm selling both the keyboard and keyset as one package, including everything you see below. 

EDIT: I apologize the confusion. I should have mentioned extras, not totals for each item. Here is the fix:

**SOLD**

- ~~plum iron165 (comes with 1 PCB, brass plate, case, and various other accessories that came with the board)~~
- ~~1 extra PCB~~
- ~~1 extra polycarb plate (7U)~~
- ~~1 extra polycarb plate (6.25U)~~
- ~~2 extra black badges~~
- ~~1 extra copper badge~~

- ~~anything else I might have missed from the pictures~~

**Polaris:**  After I found out that you couldn't use an aftermarket PCB on the Polaris I decided not to keep it because I'm mostly a hot-swap plebeian :/, but the Polaris is unpacked and unbuilt so essentially brand new; however apparently I didn't order a plate?? If you're interested in getting a plate for this board though there are listings for them on mechmarket every so often.

**GMK Dots:** I bought GMK Dots from Novelkeys during the GB. The set is pretty cool and definitely unique but I decided its just not for me. Since I was on the fence about the set I wore rubber gloves while using the set to prevent any shine lmao. Surprisingly typing on it with gloves felt fine but eventually my hands would start getting sweaty so overall not the best idea. After about 2 weeks of use I retrayed the set and its been there even since.","[US-VA] [H] Black Regular Polaris, GMK Dots [W] Paypal"

Hello everyone, I am downsizing a bit and looking to get rid of some stuff I don't use much anymore. As always, I am also looking to get some of my wants list. Feel free to reach out if you want additional pics of anything.

Prices are in USD and include shipping. I am located in the Bay Area and will offer better prices locally if we meet up on certain items. Priority goes to people I have dealt with in the past and local deals. I prefer to do US shipping, but not necessarily a deal breaker. I may have to adjust prices for shipping internationally.

To my surprise, my beloved curry sauce was not in the package; instead, staring at me was this oddly-coloured smoky cheese sauce (well actually it was the one-eyed Minion from Despicable Me on the packaging that was staring at me).Sorry for the rant, but I just wanna hop on the bandwagon of putting unrelated stories in r/mm posts. For what it's worth, this incident saddened me for a good 15 minutes or so. The cheese sauce turned out to be quite decent.

Shipping will be via express courier only to minimise complications given the current pandemic situation, with full insurance and tracking, 3-5 days delivery worldwide. \~25-30usd for keycaps, \~50-70usd for keyboards.

~~I am selling my rosegold kbdpad mkii that I built with Holy Pandas lubed with 3204 and pink durock stabs lubed with 205g0 and dielectric grease and I lined it with sorbothane.  I decided to sell because I realized I never use it and it is just taking up space on top of my computer not even plugged in.  I have seen these sell unbuilt for $175-200 so I figure $215 USD plus shipping isn't unreasonable.  GMK wob not included.~~ sold for asking price.

~~I am also selling the GMK Eclipse base kit, no shine and barely used for $150 USD plus shipping.  I can ship with the bandolier or in bags.~~

Finally I am selling EPBT Gok BoW base kit, opened and not used for $130 USD plus shipping.  I can ship in the box or in bags.

I have a lot of keycap sets coming so I figured I'd sell the ones I use the least.

Happy Friday everybody,

Hope you're all still well and staying safe & healthy. I'm continuing my quest to finally let go of my keyboard inventory. I am local to Los Angeles and willing to drive to meet you closer in the middle but priority will go to people willing to meet in my area. **Priority for all deals goes like this: local bundles, shipped bundles, local items, shipped items.** Not FCFS, CONUS shipping only. Items are priced to favor local peeps, sorry everybody else. Comment before PM, messages without comment will be ignored, chats will be ignored too. Thanks for reading, have a great rest of your weekend!

Item | Notes | Price
:-- | :-- | :--
RAMA M65-A | Gray cerakote, Millmax (7305) PCB, no stabs included. I bought it off [this nice guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/itdkh0/usca_h_cerakote_m65a_moon_u80a_artisans_bumens/) two weeks ago and while it's a fingerprint magnet, it's beautiful. There's a slight issue with the cerakoting (pictured) but it's not noticeable when built. PCB was band aid modded by previous owner, though they're a little worn. **Does not come in OG box.** | ~~$650 local, $700 shipped~~ **Sold!**
Tofu65 | Burgundy case, DZ65RGB hotswap PCB, alu plate, clipped & lubed (either GMK or Cherry) stabs, will also throw in a layer of stupidfish foam. There are some loose sockets, notably backspace and one of the R1 buttons next to spacebar, but I don't have a solder or spare sockets. There's also a ding on one of the corners from the previous owner, though it isn't very noticeable on the table. Price reflects ding and PCB problems. Basically, you're buying the case and getting the rest as add-ons. | ~~$125 local, $150 shipped~~ **Sold!**
**Built** Klippe T | Ultramarine case, WT60-D, Mekanisk polished brass plate, Mekanisk foam between PCB and case **but not** between the plate and PCB. Built with 67g Tealios (R2) lubed with 205g0, teal C3 stabs, plate has some patina spots. Pains me to part with this beauty but it doesn't get enough run to warrant keeping it. Comes with another unused layer of Mekanisk foam. **Does not come with GMK WoB.** | ~~$250 local, $275 shipped~~ **Sold!**
**Unbuilt** Klippe T | Ultramarine case, DZ60RGB ANSI PCB, alu plate. I plugged this in recently and mysteriously, the PCB doesn't work for me. The LEDs will all work but I can't get it to flash via QMK. Don't have the time to tinker with it more. | ~~$180 local, $200 shipped~~ **Sold!**
Drop ALT | High profile case in black, MK Ultra foam, gold plated Cherry plate mount stabs (from Zeal) lubed, clipped & band aid modded by previous owner, will come with stock Skylight (slate/gray) keycaps. Case is still in great condition, no noticeable dings or scratches. O and R keys have trouble registering sometimes but nothing like the other PCB issues I've noted in the other boards. | $180 local, $200 shipped
Planck Rev 6 | Black high profile case, comes with plate and foam. This little guy is from OLKB, **not Drop**. Just couldn't get used to ortho, cute little board though. Notable scratches on the bottom pictured. | ~~$125 local, $140 shipped~~ **Sold!**
Vortex Core | Rebuilt with lubed vintage blacks, unsure what lube or batch of switches these are but this is a funny little sleeper board. Unfortunately, the left spacebar doesn't work, rendering it hard to use because I use my left thumb for space. Everything else (including layers) works perfectly though. Unsure if it's a PCB issue or if the switch just needs to be resoldered so a few bucks off to reflect this. | ~~$50 local, $60 shipped~~ **Sold!**
Cooler Master Masterkeys Pro S | Cherry MX Reds, everything stock, comes with PMK DSA Dolch. Still a great board if you have a friend or family member who wants a mechanical or a gaming board and is okay with stock MX switches (honestly, it doesn't sound that bad but the stabs, *shudders*). Not separating these because I'm a lazy fuck, sorry. Comes with stock keycaps too. | $100 local, $125 shipped
GMK WoB | Pictured mounted on the built Klippe T. [Additional pictures for shine check here](https://imgur.com/a/MLjhFiM), I don't think there's very much shine -- you have to look for it really, though maybe my lighting is just flattering. Local buyers get the tray regardless. | ~~$90 local, $100 shipped **in bags** or $115 shipped **in the tray**~~ **Sold!**","[US-CA] [H] RAMA M65-A, Tofu65, 2x Klippe T, Drop ALT, Planck Rev 6, Vortex Core, Masterkeys Pro S GMK WoB [W] PayPal, Local"

~~**Plate:** Polycarbonate 60% ANSI~~

~~**Stabs:** Genuine GMK Screw-in Stabs (Clipped, Lubed) purchased from OriginativeCo~~

~~**Also included:** New/Unused set of clipped, unlubed GMK Screw-in Stabs. Figure I'd toss these in, just in case someone was unhappy with the lube job on the stabs.~~

**DETAILS** (please read entirely before asking any questions)

* Kit has been lightly used as a secondary board for about a month. It's pretty much in perfect condition to my eye, but included pictures of differing angles in the album anyway. 

* I'm leaving the stabilizers on the PCB, cause I have no need for them. Any plastic on plastic contact points have been lubed with Krytox 205g0, along with a heavy application of dielectric grease on the wire.

* The board has been fitted with 0305 MillMax hotswap sockets (ANSI layout), which make it easy for any newcomer trying to get a feel for the type of switches they like best.

* One of the switch sockets for the ESC key on the DZ60 PCB is too small to fit a hotswap socket. I opted to add a Mill Max socket to the standard sized hole and soldered the second leg of the switch, as you normally would. I'll be leaving the switch soldered in for the sale just to make things easier. It is a Tealios V2 which has been lubed with Krytox 205g0 and filmed (Kebo). 

* I've flashed the board with VIA, because it's excellent when dealing with all the underglow light settings and also why not? 

* Pictures of the current layout, keytester, and a bunch of closeups are included in the album.

Good  evening. My GMK Ursa arrived today and whilst it looks good i find that  it is a bit to muted for my liking. Looking to either sell it for  around 230 euros or trade for another gmk set.

Not  to sure what shipping costs will be but chuck a dm and ill give you a  quote. Can ship in either bags or the tray. Not FCFS but rather what is easier for me will be priorotized.

Howdy.

~~GMK Metropolis Base - [This](https://i.imgur.com/AfPKWe0.jpg) set hasn't seen a great deal of use and, though is a interesting set, happens to get swapped out eventually. It hasn't shined as of yet and is just the base kit. Asking price is **£185/$240**~~**Sold**

~~GMK Calm Depths Assembly and Space Bar Kit - Bought [this](https://i.imgur.com/AfPKWe0.jpg) on the off change I use some otho/splergo board... never did. No shine and I haven't used it at all. Will not ship in it's tray. Asking price for both kits is **£140/$180**~~**Sold**

* [Koalas](https://i.imgur.com/TVR9ysq.jpg) x 85 - These switches have been used in a board for the last 6 months and are getting replaced due to wanting a different tactile switch. They have been lubed with 3204 on just the rails, I'm happy with the lube job on these. Asking price is **£55/$70**

~~[Gateron Yellows](https://i.imgur.com/TAAZgEm.jpg) x 72 (60 lubed, 12 unlubed) - These are transparent topped / black bottom Yellows (KS-8). They have been in and out of a couple boards.
