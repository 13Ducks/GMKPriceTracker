Have some things to sell / prod interest for today. I am looking for mostly PayPal, but am also interested in some RAMA Brass caps, or the polished aluminum caps for Thermal -- shiny things! Also interested if you may have a source for obtaining some cool ANIMAL CROSSING ARTISANS. Also interested in picking up an Enter Key from the GMK Striker kit -- apparently it comes with a normal blue enter and a darker blue enter ... I presume some people don't use the darker blue enter so I would be willing to take that if you don't use it!

Shipping is $3 CONUS.

**~~Milky Alpacas - $70~~ SOLD** 
-

I have 67 Milky Alpacas. They are built using Alpaca stems in Gateron milky housings, with Gateron yellow springs. Lubed with 205g0 on stems, 105 on springs. 60 of them are desoldered cleanly, though the heat does do a bit of yellowing on the base around the pins. They are good to be used in a hot swap without any issues. See photo for a representation of the bottoms / pins: [IMAGE](https://i.imgur.com/8qmhaW8.jpg). See here for a typing test: [TYPING TEST (unmute audio)](https://i.imgur.com/ng6ssip.mp4).

I may be interested in trading for other e-white boards. If you would really like to buy it all as a bundle, I would consider $599 + shipping. Not looking to part anything other than the POM plate, unless you really really want something and are willing to pay a premium.

**Leaf60 e-white HHKB, desoldered PCB, e-white plate - NFS / $450**

Comes with a desoldered PCB -- this PCB has been desoldered a few times so it is in decent condition, completely functional and tested. May want to clean the flux off of it and misc. dielectric grease :P... There are some minor grey dots on the e-white finish, but from what I've heard it is hard to pull off a flawless e-white finish. A few small blemishes here and there, but mostly in fantastic condition. Comes with that sweet gold PVD brass weight. E-white plate is surprisingly in fantastic condition... beautiful plate.

**Leaf60 Hotswap PCB - NFS / $100**

Hotswap PCB. Used but good condition. Nothing wrong with it.

**Leaf60 Polycarbonate Plate - NFS / $35**

Polycarbonate plate. My favorite on the Leaf60 tied with the Aluminum plate. Decent condition.

Good Evening /r/mechmarket 

**Minitomic Prototype**

~~This is a 45%, 13U wide board from Martenwuut originally.  I still don't think the GB has happened yet.  I picked this board up from another user a while ago and it came with Ergo Clears in it.  I desoldered those with a vacuum gun and put in 62g lubed Zilents along with a few lubed Gateron Black Inks.~~  

~~It has a Brass Plate and Lubed GMK Stabilzer.  This board is a lot of fun to use, and it has a USB-C port for the PCB.  The case is silver, and has really good weight to it, and it's flawless with 4 rubber bumpons.~~

~~This is a good board for someone to try and make the switch to a less than 60% board.~~  

HOWEVER - You will need to get the fork from Martenwuut's Github to program it as it's not on QMK Configurator yet.  I can help you get that if needed.

~~I'm asking $150 shipped CONUS with PP Fees included.~~

**SA Hyperfuse R2**

~~What's included in the set minus the 6U spacebar:  (See below)~~

https://www.originativeco.com/products/sa-hyperfuse

~~Picked up this set a few months ago and I barely use it.  It's been sitting on one of my boards but I realize that I'm not a huge SA fan anymore and these should go to someone who will use them.  There is light shine but this set is already smooth and shiny to begin with.  It's in near perfect condition otherwise.~~

~~When I bought the set, it didn't include the stock spacebars.  Only a 6.25U from what appears to be either SA Doom or SA Grand Budapest.  Either way it wasn't a perfect match, so I went ahead and ordered a 6.25U and 7U in the correct Grey color from PMK.  The 6.25U has been mounted and used, but the 7U is still BNIB.~~  

~~I'm asking $200 O.B.O. shipped with PP Fees included CONUS.~~

**WANT**

I'm also looking to separately purchase JTK Debut (PoW) if you have it.

These have never been mounted and I am the second owner. I just bought these but they didn't end up matching the way I wanted with a build and the spacebar gets stuck in the down position so you'll have to fix that hence me making it a bit cheaper than what I bought it for.

Hi r/mm!

Just as the title suggests I'm trying to sell off these cream switches and keycap set. I wanted to try the cream switches after all the hype that it was getting after the Tfue build, but didn't end up liking them because of the leathery feel and heavy bottom out. I've lubed 67 of them with 205g0 on the stem/bottom housing and TX oil on the springs. I will include 4 stock ones making a total of 71 cream switches. Two of the switches have clipped legs since I was testing this out on a GMMK board. The DSA keycap set I got awhile back and used it for about a month before getting my first GMK set. I'm also looking to purchase a GMK WoB set. Condition of the kit doesn't matter. Comment below before pm'ing me (**Please no reddit chat as I will ignore it**). I'm local to 91776 if someone wants to meet up for a local sale and save on shipping. Thanks for looking and stay safe!

Edit: I've added a couple more pictures to the album. I received a lot of PMs, these are most likely all spoken for, check your PMs after this post. Answering some common questions:

* Yes, I'm going to add shipping to the price, I will refund the difference of whatever isn't used for shipping.
* MiTo Laser Alt Dusk does not come with keycaps or switches, it does come with the extras (keycap puller, switch puller, limited edition key, sample switches).
* Local (US) shipping only.
* Local exchange is an option, you'll be doing most of the legwork in coming to me.

Final Edit: To bnaz17, the super tough internet warrior who ""could easily rip your throat out with just my thumb and pinky"" as he so eloquently put it, all you had to do was point out the pricing rules instead of sending silly baseless threats, take your keyboard fury elsewhere. I didn't know that the rules advise sending transactions as Goods and Services (because I didn't read them, my fault), I was repeating the process used when I bought these items over a year ago from this subreddit.

Hello,

I have for sale a GMK Triumph Alder set, and an U87 Realforce. 

 
I am asking $125 for the TA GMK - open to offers because of the missing key. Not sure what the market for a complete set is. So if someone has a good idea let me know.

I am asking $180 for the RF U87.

----------------------------------------

The Triumph Alder set has been my DD on my leopold, but there is no sign of any shining. No scratches or anything like that. The only issue is that I lost the ""Z"" key. I have one of the blank key caps on the z key, and it dosent bother me. Does not include the pokemon aluminum keycaps or the space bar- that is part of a different set. On a few of the close ups there is some dead skin built up. I just noticed that and will clean them up before I ship them out FYI.


The Realforce is a 2nd hand keeb so I don't know the full history, but I have been using it as a DD at work for about a year. Nothing wrong with it, but the keys could use a little cleaning. This is my grail keyboard TBH, but I need money to invest right now. Comes with windowed caps locks, and insert? key. Also comes with OEM key puller. I am also throwing in a specialty-run orange ""realforce"" key from a massdrop RF 10-numpad drop from a few years back. I dont have any use for it without a topre keeb anymore.


If you have question or need more pictures please ask. I will not respond to PMs if you do not comment in the thread.

I usually am able to ship for $5 domestically. If international people are interested then I can check international shipping rates.

SOLD, thank you

Hi all,

I have an UT47.2 keyboard for sale. I cant get used to this layout so despite Me investing quite a bit of time and effort into this, it still has to go up here.

Specs:
- 40% layout (see qmk configuration web for the layout)
- hotswappable PCB
- rgb underglow
- original kit has the top and bottom plate. I also 3d printed a case to cover all side of the keyboard. The case make it much more hefty and sturdy. See the board with case full pic [here](https://i.imgur.com/HiKYaor.jpg)
- gmk stab lubed
- and as always the board is working.

The bottom plate has some marks, hard to see under light so I tried my best to capture them in pictures. Please check the album for them

See the album [here](https://imgur.com/a/wtjp7hQ)

Asking for 70 gbp. SOLD.I do have 40 koalas tactile 62g switches and 7 yellow gateron (my habit of mixing linear with tactile in a board) for another 15gbp if you want. They are only used in this board so never been soldered and I bought them brand new. Keycaps you see WONT be included. That short little cable is included if you want. 

Paypal fee is on me, shipping is on the buyer. Given the circumstances, i will prioritize UK buyer since Im sure I can ship to them.

Oh one last thing I can flash it with whatever layout you want before sending it to you. Need help with that just ask.

Hi all- I have some stuff to sell today.

15x Nolives and 9x Zealios - $25 SOLD

These switches are unlubed. This comes with 1 H1 switch (see below).

70x KBDfans T1s - $40 SOLD

34x Retooled MX Blacks - $10 SOLD

These switches are unlubed. This comes with 1 H1 switch (see below).

GMK White-on-Black - $85 SOLD

These keycaps have been used for about a month. All the keys in the original Drop set will be included, not just the ones in the picture. They will be shipped in a bag unless requested otherwise. This comes with 2 H1 switches (see below).

The goal of including H1 switches with each purchase is to allow some other members of the community to try the switches out before the full batch comes out. Obviously, posting your thoughts on the switch is suggested, but I can't enforce anything like that.

Have a good weekend everyone, and daily reminder to wash your hands!

GMK Nautilus Base Kit - Trade (STRONGLY preferred) or $240 + shipping cost, method of buyer's choice

I've had the Nautilus mounted for a few days now and I'm having second thoughts about the colorway. The naut has slight shining on WASD and surrounding keys (from the previous owner), but is otherwise great and is the full base. I'm mainly looking for [these keysets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sJQa_bM59gPAXXLIcwdNNI6Qj7qw5yryYH_gP0UiIDs/edit?usp=sharing) but I'm open to others. I'll be shipping in bags.

I'm really only interested in a trade. My endgame is one of the keysets on that list, if you 100% need this keyset and if I HAD to name a price I'd sell for 240 to guarantee being able to get a different keyset. 

Sorry if that's expensive, but I'm trying to avoid the hassle of waiting to find another seller as well.",[US-PA] [H] GMK Nautilus Base Kit[W] GMK Keysets

Hi, Please comment before PMing. Prices include Paypal fees, and shipping to CONUS.

~~I have a TKC1800 that was cerakoted Benelli Sand, built with Novelias and clipped/lubed GMK screw in stabilizers. The Novelias have their stem shaved, so should lessen the risk of stretching out GMK caps. I screwed up on 3 at F6-F8 by shaving it too much, had to use a bit of plumber's tape to get the caps snug.  The metal sticker on the back is a bit wavy, because I took it off and reapplied in after cerakoting. Finish is pretty good, but haven't had much experience with cerakote.

AL1: $349.98 shipped to US, OBO
Red top, black bottom, brass weight inside case. Built with Outemu Sky switches and stabs were clipped, lubed, and band-aid modded when put together. Great board, cool layout. Had some minor hiccups with the W key every so often, so I tried to jump it and it seems to have fixed the issue, however there are some wires on the backside of the PCB now because of it, works fine otherwise, can't tell they exist when put together. It does have a slight ding in the upper right corner of the case (originally received from GB this way), but it's barely noticeable, I tried taking two pictures of it, but it's hard to see, more pictures can be available on request, just ask. 

Gmk Skidata+ base, color pack, and relegendables: PENDING FOR $219.98PENDING
Love love love the colors, if I wasn't getting rid of the board I'd keep this set. There's some shine on the F and J keys, but I think for the most part they're fairly good. The major thing is that there is NO 'D' key. I don't know, it should be here somewhere, but I couldn't find it. Price is without 'D', if you want the 'D', I'll send it your way if I find it or I'll update my posts when I do, sorry.

I got my first rama cap recently (gmk vaporwave) and they're really nice so I'm looking to add more to the collection, lmk if you are looking to trade yours.

**OG Blue Jelly Poms - $155 conus**

So far these have never been mounted and I am the second owner. I just bought these but they didn't end up matching the way I wanted with a build and the spacebar gets stuck in the down position so you'll have to fix that hence me making it a bit cheaper than what I bought it for.

**Alps Mod Shop**


-  62 Alps SKCM Ambers 
Another batch of perfect switches. These were taken from an Apple IIc keyboard unit. Pretty much the same as above. Switches feel consistent and smooth throughout. If new switches are even better then they must be godly cause I’ve never felt anything comparable to these. Once again for these reasons above I’ll be going for ~~225$~~ 200$ for the batch. Also have the keycaps and stabs available. 25$ alone or 20$ bundled with the switches. 

-  ~~105 orange alps, unsoldered from an aek. About a 7.5-8/10. They have not been cleaned but for an extra I could get them in the ultrasonic and dry lube them. 100$~~ Sold

-  52 Alps SKCM Undamped/Undampened Creams. Not be confused with the readily available damped creams these are much rarer. They were unsoldered from an impeccable  canon typewriter (another 52 switches are coming in next week if you need more). I’d rate them a 8.5/10. They feel smooth and consistent but some of them click on the upstroke. A simple paper mod would probably clear this issue as it isn’t very significant. I’ve cleared this problem on some oranges that had much more click on the upstroke so I’m pretty confident that this is an easy fix. Haven’t cleaned them as they are already smooth. 
Asking 150$. ~~Alps double shot spherical keycaps also available with corresponding stabs 20$ alone or 15$ bundled~~ Sold

-  50 alps plate springs 
These were rough when I desoldered them  but they take a cleaning real well. These were ultrasonically cleaned and reassembled. Didn’t bother dry lubing cause they feel great once cleaned. This is good for all you hipsters out there that wanna do your own thing. Screw those holy pandas and think outside the box. Asking ~~75$~~ 65$


**MX Pit Stop**

-  ~~GMK Olive 
Used for a week, no shine, like new. Just the base kit. 170$ obo~~ Awaiting funds

-  DSA Granite
Alpha and icon mods kit, not much more to say about this one other then it’s in good condition and is picking up dust in the drawer so time to let it go!80$

- SP Modern Selectric
This set covers a 60-65% depending on your layout. Has the blue mods and black alphas as seen in the album. Tried basing the price from what I’ve been told and what has sold in the past so let’s try 200$ obo 

- Vortex Pok3r
Selling this for a friend. Comes with cable and thicc vortex caps and MX Clears. 80$

-  Keyforge Galaxy Hamdust Orochi
Brand new, unmounted in original pouch/bag. ~~125$~~ 115$

Hey guys, I have some items to sell

All prices include PayPal fees and shipping. Invoice only. As usual please comment before DM.

**1.** **Salvun comissioned artisans.**

I have some artisans that I commissioned Salvun with. I wanted them for myself but there are MOQs and all that jazz, so selling extras. In total 21 were made, 11 are b-stock (old CNC) and 10 are a-stock (new Haas CNC), machining is really high quality on both though. There are 2 of a-stock remaining and 9 of b-stock. MX stem, R1 (Esc row), Alu with anodizing and laser engraving, the design is an occult symbol of the MX stem.

**A-stock**, black box, perfect ano and engraving; **$48** **shipped** worldwide; 2 available

**B-stock**, yellow box, there are some ano blemishes here and there but mostly on the sides, engraving is not as clear as well, see the album for that; **$36** **shipped** worldwide; 9 available

[Timestamp](https://imgur.com/5P4hHCt)

I'm selling an introductory board I made. Put this together in January and used for about 2 months. Really wanted my arrow keys back and a few keys for push-to-talk, macros, etc. Would love to move to a 65% as a result.

Pictures of my board: [https://imgur.com/a/GCeMA1p](https://imgur.com/a/GCeMA1p)

Looking to sell the following as a whole, not in parts. But my breakdown for the cost would be:

* 5degree case + dzrgb60-ansi v2 (Hotswap) +aluminum plate + Everglide Stabilizers = $180 USD
* Tealios + UHMWPE stems, filmed and lubed with Krytox 205g0 = $80 USD
* GMK Red Suns keycap set (Will provide all keycaps) = $100 USD

Total = $360 USD - (About 10% since used for 2 months) = $330+Shipping final price.

Switches are amazing and smooth. The board is constructed with foam on the bottom layer and plate foam, but it's not Mkultra-foam. I cut it myself. Plate foam are small 1CM segments, functioning like standoffs between the plate and PCB to dampen vibrations. Case foam is solid layers, filling both battery well and area between case and PCB. No sound demo, but it is a tray mount so specific keys do have more of a difference.

I'm not Taeha....yet.

If you have a KBD67 MKII, preferably black and hot-swap, I can do 325+ Shipping.","[US-CA] [H] KBDFans 5Degree Built with UHMWPE Tealios [W] Paypal, KBD67MKII Hotswap"

I realized that I have not touched either of these headphones in well over a year, as I am always using my speaker setup instead.

ESW10jpns are in perfect condition, and AD-2000 sounds perfect, but the headband squeaks little when adjusting the headbands and it is missing 1/8"" to 1/4"" adaptor, but no flaws otherwise.

Timestamps: [https://imgur.com/a/2nmN5fM](https://imgur.com/a/2nmN5fM)

Hey guys!:) Selling a whole bunch of GMK Yuri stuff. When this set came out a long time ago some of the row profiles were misprinted, and Massdrop sent out a small fix pack a few months afterwards. The sets that I'm selling here include the fix pack, so you end up with a few extra keys that have funky profiles which is kinda cool.

Only the base kit has been used for about 2 months. It's still pretty new, but there's just a tiny bit of shine starting to show. **Every other kit is brand new.** Unfortunately, the ""K"" keycap in the base kit has a bit of a chip in the back (shown in the pictures) but it's not very noticeable and pretty small.

For now I don't want to split the set unfortunately. The keycaps are in bags. I've attached a timestamp below with all of the keycaps in the Massdrop page display configuration so you can see that everything is there.

**GMK Yuri:**

Base Kit - $220

Cyrillics - $100

Icon Modifiers (with fix) - $80

Glorious - $20

Spacebars - $40

**Total - $460 + shipping**

If you buy it as a set we can do a bit of a discount, something like $430 + shipping. I'm open to offers though so just let me know. Only looking for PayPal however. Shipping within Canada is $10 and to CONUS is $15. Not shipping outside of North America at this time unfortunately.

Edit (2020-03-31): Prices reduced!

Like many people I am stuck at home even more than usual, so now I'm cleaning out my top drawer of keyboard stuff a bit.

In the pictures of the XDA Oblique, the enter and 1.75u shift are in the wrong kit. Also, I forgot to include the date the first time, so I quickly retook the photos with the date. The old photos are still there because they are nicer.

I'm not looking to split the different keysets, but I'm open for negotiations if there happen to be multiple buyers.

Hi. I am getting out of the hobby, I'm not going to stop using mechanical keyboards or stop building my own it's just that I've learned I'm perfectly happy with a budget friendly build that looks good. I don't need endgame stuff I'm happy with what I got here [https://i.redd.it/mzev37gfw1141.jpg](https://i.redd.it/mzev37gfw1141.jpg) and here [https://i.redd.it/05wza5lqhz941.jpg](https://i.redd.it/05wza5lqhz941.jpg)  .

So I'm selling all my stuff, see all of it below:

**I'm willing to make a deal if someone wants to take everything for $425 firm** **~~$500 (negotiable)~~** **shipped. That is $200 saved. PM if you're interested in this deal for local.**

If the buying the whole bundle interests you please pm me asap. I will give you priority over all other buyers.

I will give this post 24hours from now before confirming sales to those buying individual items.

**Comment first before PM.**

**THE INVYR STEMS ARE LONG GONE, PLEASE DON'T ASK**

Hello /r/mechmarket 

Asking $60 shipped with PP Fees included CONUS

**SA Hyperfuse R2**

What's included in the set minus the 6U spacebar:  (See below)

https://www.originativeco.com/products/sa-hyperfuse

Picked up this set a few months ago and I barely use it.  It's been sitting on one of my boards but I realize that I'm not a huge SA fan anymore and these should go to someone who will use them.  There is light shine but this set is already smooth and shiny to begin with.  It's in near perfect condition otherwise.

When I bought the set, it didn't include the stock spacebars.  Only a 6.25U from what appears to be either SA Doom or SA Grand Budapest.  Either way it wasn't a perfect match, so I went ahead and ordered a 6.25U and 7U in the correct Grey color from PMK.  The 6.25U has been mounted and used, but the 7U is still BNIB.  

I'm asking $200 O.B.O. shipped with PP Fees included CONUS.

**WANT**

Besides Paypal, I'm looking for a base + 40's kit or something similar of either GMK, OEM, DSA, etc.. I'm really open to colorways at this time.  Show me what you got.  We can work + or - paypal on either end.

I'm also looking to separately purchase JTK Debut (PoW) if you have it.

Have a few sets about to come on shortly and looking to get rid of those that wont be seeing anytime on my boards in the near future.

\------  GMK Oblivion v2 Git Base & Hagorama Cadet Alphas - This kit comes with the Fix kit, and the Hello World! key. These were used for a day or two max and were mainly used for glory shorts on my keyboard, I absolutely love the kits but only have room for so many grey kits. Looking to sell both as bundle and priority will be given to those that wish to do so, however I am open to splitting them up.

* Bundled 305 shipped in bags

~~------ (SOLD)JTK Hyperfuse with both Add-on kits - This set is brand new, been typed on for maybe an hour max, really do not want to let this go but with my new GMK Vaporwave the colorways are almost identical and only have room for 1 Purple/Cyan kit currently.~~

* ~~165 shipped in bags (SOLD)~~

\------ Rathcaps OG Teen Groot - This mold is absolutely amazing but since I just wont he Anhilation BBgroot, the OG just doesn't match any of my current colorways.

* 60 shipped OBO / Also trades for Galaxkeys Immersion + paypal on my end

Im also looking to acquire the GMK Dots set, Or Laser Cyberdeck with Mitowaves, I would be willing to work out a deal for a trade or cash.

As always all prices are OBO and this is not FCFS, Priority will be giving to CONUS buyers but for shipping coverage buy the buyer I am willing to ship to anywhere in the world.  Please Comment here first before PM, I do not get Reddit chat so if you send one I will not receive it.\\

Hey guys, strapped for cash atm and I need to sell my keyboard.

\- xd60/xd64 case, same as this one [here](https://drop.com/buy/xd60-xd64-custom-mechanical-keyboard-kit). Super nice, heavy full alu case, i filled the bottom with some shelf liner and it sounds and feels amazing.

\- gk61 hotswap pcb, you would have to use the gk61 software but its not as bad as some people make it seem to be. pretty decent customization and has rgb smd leds.

\- lubed(trib 3204), retooled, pink filmed cherry blacks. bought from here, they feel great.

\- alu plate

\- genuine cherry plate mount stabilizers, they dont feel/sound bad at all imo, despite plate mount not being as good as pcb/screw ins. had to buy these because the gk61 pcb doesn't support pcb mount for all keys.

\- [this keycap set](https://kbdfans.com/collections/keycaps/products/68keys-dye-sub-keycaps-set). as you can see, it comes with 1 less 1.5u and no 2.25u right shift. i bought black gmk singles from someone on here, which explains why i have those keys on the board. you can have the remaining keys if you want them.

[heres](https://vocaroo.com/hKBW2U9dfCP) a pretty scuffed sound test, im not sure why its so quiet, i had my mic on max. please don't hesitate to ask questions.

will be cleaned thoroughly ofc before shipping.

Hoping to avoid these collecting dust, and instead being appreciated/put to use in a loving home. Asking prices include continental US shipping, but I'd be happy to provide a quote for any international buyers.

**Looking to sell:**

~~RGBKB Sol 2 - White aluminum 1.6mm plate, regular polycarbonate frame. built with Gateron black silent inks lubed with 205g0, 2 Alps EC11 rotary encoders. Unfortunately just couldn't get used to the layout with keys in different spots, especially since as a technician I have to frequently use ""normal"" keyboards. Was planning to desolder the switches end encoders before selling, but figured I'd keep them on in case anyone wants the assembled kit. Asking $280, will take $40 off price to desolder the switches. EDIT: Forgot to add that these are silent inks, not regular.~~ SOLD

~~GMK Modern Dolch - Base, icons, and spacebars kit. Used for a few months. very small amount of shine on some of the home row keys as well as the 6.5U spacebars. Really hard to capture on camera, it's almost non-existent unless you really look for it. Prefer keeping all the kits together, but if there's enough interest for a specific kit I am happy to split them up. $300.~~ Traded

~~Alpaca Keyboards Hot Dox base kit - Bought to test out the Ergodox layout while waiting for the Sol above. No issues. $120.~~ SOLD

NovelKeys Box Royal switches x62 - Note that these are from the initial offering and  before they were retooled. Without shaving down the stems, they will stretch GMK caps and likely others. $20

~~(Mass)Drop MT3 /dev/tty Round 2 Ortho kit - a few of the blank keycaps have been mounted on a switch tester, others are completely unused. $30.~~ SOLD

**Alps Mod Shop**


-  62 Alps SKCM Ambers 
Another batch of perfect switches. These were taken from an Apple IIc keyboard unit. Pretty much the same as above. Switches feel consistent and smooth throughout. If new switches are even better then they must be godly cause I’ve never felt anything comparable to these. Once again for these reasons above I’ll be going for ~~225$~~ 200$ for the batch. Also have the keycaps and stabs available. 25$ alone or 20$ bundled with the switches. 

-  105 orange alps, unsoldered from an aek. About a 7.5-8/10. They have not been cleaned but for a extra I could get them in the ultrasonic and dry lube them. 100$

-  52 Alps SKCM Undamped/Undampened Creams. Not be confused with the readily available damped creams these are much rarer. They were unsoldered from an impeccable  canon typewriter (another 52 switches are coming in next week if you need more). I’d rate them a 8.5/10. They feel smooth and consistent but some of them click on the upstroke. A simple paper mod would probably clear this issue as it isn’t very significant. I’ve cleared this problem on some oranges that had much more click on the upstroke so I’m pretty confident that this is an easy fix. Haven’t cleaned them as they are already smooth. 
Asking 150$. Alps double shot spherical keycaps also available with corresponding stabs 20$ alone or 15$ bundled 

-  50 alps plate springs 
These were rough when I desoldered them  but they take a cleaning real well. These were ultrasonically cleaned and reassembled. Didn’t bother dry lubing cause they feel great once cleaned. This is good for all you hipsters out there that wanna do your own thing. Screw those holy pandas and think outside the box. Asking ~~75$~~ 65$


**MX Pit Stop**

-  GMK Olive 
Used for a week, no shine, like new. Just the base kit. 180$ obo

-  DSA Granite
Alpha and icon mods kit, not much more to say about this one other then it’s in good condition and is picking up dust in the drawer so time to let it go!80$

- SP Modern Selectric
This set covers a 60-65% depending on your layout. Has the blue mods and black alphas as seen in the album. Tried basing the price from what I’ve been told and what has sold in the past so let’s try 200$ obo 

- Vortex Pok3r
Selling this for a friend. Comes with cable and thicc vortex caps and MX Clears. 80$

-  Keyforge Galaxy Hamdust Orochi
Brand new, unmounted in original pouch/bag. ~~125$~~ 115$

People from the Netherlands will get priority. But they’ll have to purchase it through Marktplaats and pay with Ideal. Then I’ll get my money quicker then instead with Paypal. Only used them a couple of times, because the keyboard they are on is broken. For more pics, send me a message.

### NEC PC-8801 Blue Alps Keyboard

- Very clean 8801 with Blue Alps (grey switchplate). Old 15-pin connector.
- Haven't verified functionality but keys all feel great, opened to check switchplate and slider, feel 9/10, only some slight dust on the bottom of the switch, nothing in the top housing.
- Case and keycaps (katakana dye-sub pbt alphas, doubleshot abs alphas) are unyellowed
- Caps appear to be relatively unused without much shine. Original texture seems to be all there. 
- Original coil/cable in good condition and clean as well.
- Plate has some chipped spots. Gave it a wipe down. I have a plate in better condition that I could include as a spare if desired.
- I don't own an adapter but I could purchase one for you ($30) from a Japanese seller or check out deskthority for some DIY guides

Price: $250 shipped (via surface mail)

___________________

### Switches

- If you need more or less switches than the quantity listed just PM and I might have extras.
- Add SKCM Lock switches for $1 each

##### SKCM Blue x80

- closeups: https://imgur.com/a/w7WKZm8
- 8/10 blue alps. Top housings are clean so keyfeel is unaffected with strong clicks. Sliders are clean and unworn.
- Some exterior dust with a little on bottom housings.
- Will do additional ultrasonic clean of top housings and dusting of bottoms if desired for $0.25/sw; and/or lube (your choice) for $0.25/sw.

Price: $160 ($2/sw)

##### SKCM Dampened White x100

- They feel fine for what they are but they're not my thing. Good for spare parts or matias substitute.

Price: $10 ($0.1/switch)

##### ~~Cherry MX Black x80~~ SOLD

- Not vintage but still fairly smooth from use. Can provide closeups of stems if desired. Don't have cherries to compare them to but quite similar to stock gateron in terms of smoothness. 

Price: $20 ($0.25/sw)

_________________________

### Apple AEK 2 M0312J 

- like new aek2 with JP caps. Case is remarkably clean and non-yellowed, caps and case are pretty much the same tone of Apple beige. 
- Switches feel clean for what they are (dampened whites)
- can build pro micro hasu adb adapter for $15 (required to use, board uses adb)
- includes adb cable

Price: $150 shipped (via surface mail)

_________________________

### Apple M0116J

- Good condition Apple Keyboard with JP caps. Case and caps could use some cleaning.
- Switches are Alps Salmon but they're easily 9 or 10 / 10, they feel light and clean with no binding. 
- can build pro micro hasu adb adapter for $15 (required to use, board uses adb)
- Includes original box and adb cable. I can also include a spare outer case if needed.

Price: $150 shipped (via surface mail)

### Toshiba J3100GL spare keyboard

A spare part for the Japan-exclusive version of the T3100 ""laptop"" computer, a bit different from the one I had last time as this one was marked for the GL variant. This is the last one of these that I have, haven't been able to find any more. These use Alps Common Mount Low Profile (SKFM/SKFN), but still have OG Alps doubleshots with lots of Hiragana sublegends (and some printed front legends as well!). The color scheme is a white text on very light grey, with slightly darker grey mods - like a lower contrast Oblivion/MoDo. 

- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/z3sAS3u
- [The KLE layout for the GT version.](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/8a06796d2c16c3ac42eb5387351cc586) I haven't drawn one up for this version yet.
- Alps SKFL, PCB Mount. PCB cloth cover missing. However, plastic cover + original Alps manufacturer sticker remains on the back.
- OEM profile Alps-made thick doubleshot keycaps with Hiragana sublegends. The legends are fairly normal compared to the one sold last time but this one has lots of nice, contrasting orange text on some of the utility keys. Compared to the other J3100 GL I had, this has slightly more wear but still overall good condition. Dropped the price to account for that though.

Price: $80

_________________________

### Keycaps

##### Apple AEK II JP Keycaps

- Apple Alps dye-subbed keycaps with JP sublegends, in extremely good condition. Spacebar is non-yellowed but has a bit of shine. Spacebar comparison to NOS: https://imgur.com/a/4sgFqzb
- Mexico-made with dark/bold black dyesub
- Includes stabilizers, clips, mounts.

Price: $120

##### Apple IIGS Keycaps

- Apple Alps dye-subbed keycaps, AEK profile but in the square-shaped IIGS shape. Identical to m0116 BUT number row is rotated 90-degrees so not recommended unless you have either a Planck-esque keyboard or a IIGS in need of caps

Price: $20

##### NEC PC8801 Keycaps, dye-sub alpha / ABS doubleshot mods

- Katakana-sublegended Dye-Sub PBT Alphas
- Alphas in great condition but the mods are very yellowed. Comes with stabilizers.

Price: $40

##### ~~GMK Striker / Blue Samurai~~ SOLD

- Full base kit, mounted for typing tests (SMK switches) with no perceptible shine. Will take closeups for the interested buyer. 
- Mounted on my backup keyboard as seen in the picture (only the caps in the picture, other caps are untouched).
- Ships in original tray/box

Price: $200

##### epbt SimpleJA ortho kit

- I bought the ortho kit instead of the spacebars. $15 or trade for simpleja spacebars

___________________

### Misc

##### Shiny steel Iris plates 

- cut by laserboost. standard Iris plates, 1.5mm thick MX-alps hybrid mounts, nice and hefty and shiny. Was planned to be used in build but I lost them for a few months. Only the top plates here. I have a set of acrylic bottoms but they are for a fullhand case and not the standard one.

Price: $60

##### E-white tofu + 60% brass plate + XW60 PCB + SMK MX-mount Orange Linears + clipped/lubed cherry screw-in stabs + mkultra 60% foam

- ~~gmk striker is mounted on this keyboard. I'd like to sell it after selling the caps so I have a reason to take them all off.~~ 
- ~~will take more pictures of it once striker is sold, or if there is an interested buyer.~~ Pictures are available at top of page
- Case is in pristine condition with no defects; switches are NOS vintage SMK linears.
- Case $150, ~~PCB+plate+switches+stabs $100, 60% foam $10. Bundle for $250~~

___________________

### WANT

##### SimpleJA Spacebar kit

- I need this. I'll pay $25.

##### Planck MX plate

- maybe you have a spare plate for a hi-pro planck that works for MX switches. I'll pay $10. Or trade you my alps one.

##### Nexus alps sliders ~~/ housings~~

- I know these have a bunch of issues, but I want to try some with Alps linears since there isn't a clickleaf to crush. I'd like to get around 100 if possible. Or if you have any news of a second round with fixes then please tell me.

Good Afternoon /r/mechmarket 

**154x Invyr Uhmwpe Stems**

~~Was planning on using these in a build but never got around to it.  Originally purchased the 110x from switchmod, but then purchased more from a discord user.  They were opened and 1 of them was lubed, but none were used.  Put back in the bag and sitting in my desk ever since.~~

Asking $60 shipped with PP Fees included CONUS

**SA Hyperfuse R2**

~~What's included in the set minus the 6U spacebar.  (See below)~~

https://www.originativeco.com/products/sa-hyperfuse

~~Picked up this set a few months ago and I barely use it.  It's been sitting on one of my boards but I realize that I'm not a huge SA fan anymore and these should go to someone who will use them.  There is light shine but this set is already smooth and shiny to begin with.  It's in near perfect condition otherwise.~~

~~When I bought the set, it didn't include the stock spacebars.  Only a 6.25U from what appears to be either SA Doom or SA Grand Budapest.  Either way it wasn't a perfect match, so I went ahead and ordered a 6.25U and 7U in the correct Grey color from PMK.  The 6.25U has been mounted and used, but the 7U is still BNIB.~~  

~~I'm asking $200 O.B.O. shipped with PP Fees included CONUS.~~


**WANT**

Besides Paypal, I'm looking for a base + 40's kit or something similar of either GMK, OEM, DSA, etc.. I'm really open to colorways at this time.  Show me what you got.  We can work + or - paypal on either end.

EDIT: I'm also looking to separately purchase JTK Debut (PoW) if you have it.

Today I have for you a TKL Leopold board with Cherry Silent Reds that have been spring-swapped to 62g gold-plated springs, as well as lubed.  These mods were not done by me, they were done by another redditor.  I have found that Leopold is by far the best prebuilt that you can buy, and the keycaps are on par if not better than ones that you can get from GMK. Will come in OG box, with all OG accessories. No shine on keycaps. Switches are just a bit heavy for me, thats all. 

For those that are looking for a frame of reference, I would compare the feel of the switches to the lubed Gat Silent Black Inks that I have.

Hey Y'all! I'm looking to do a few switcheroos on here to try getting a nice simple looking Keeb for work. Not smart enough to do my own build so just trying to really combine some colors I like.

The Keeb I am currently selling is my Ducky Miya Pro with cherry mx brown switches. Used very lightly because weeks later I won an O2M from a ducky giveaway.

The artisans I have for up are:

|Bro DFA Froper - $200 or trade|KRAP Franken Oso (trade)|Playyd Sonic the Hedgehog - $35/trade|
|:-|:-|:-|
|BOB Translucent Genger (SOLD)|Bad Laser Daffy v2 - $50/trade|Art Key OG Bearlot - (trade)|
||Bad Valentine Koala + Blank - (SOLD)||

Overall I'm looking to make some trades. Will consider sales but no promises.

Really hoping to find a Ducky One 2 full size white keys w/ white case. Preferably mx Blue, Brown, or Silver.

Would also love to find a set of the GMK UNIQEY-Blue keycaps, or GMK Cyan, or GMK Triumph Adler. As long as either comes in the full set to cover Num Pad as well.

And finally the White and Blue BAD Daffy White Walker Artisan

&#x200B;

I am willing to combine anything on here to hit my goal and can also include Paypal/venmo

Shipping can be negotiated. Prefer CONUS, but am willing to work with what I can get.

Aristans with prices are for sale as well as trade. Feel free to shoot me some cool offers!","[US-CA][H] Ducky Miya Pro, Artisans [W] GMK UNIQEY-Blue, Ducky One 2 White on White, Bad Daffy White Walker"

Hey guys, I have some items to sell

All prices include PayPal fees and shipping. Invoice only. As usual please comment before DM.

**1.** **Salvun comissioned artisans.**

I have some artisans that I commissioned Salvun with. I wanted them for myself but there are MOQs and all that jazz, so selling extras. In total 21 were made, 11 are b-stock (old CNC) and 10 are a-stock (new Haas CNC), machining is really high quality on both though. There are 8 of a-stock and 9 of b-stock remaining. MX stem, R1 (Esc row), Alu with anodizing and laser engraving, the design is an occult symbol of the MX stem.

**A-stock**, black box, perfect ano and engraving; **$48** **shipped** worldwide; 3 available

**B-stock**, yellow box, there are some ano blemishes here and there but mostly on the sides, engraving is not as clear as well, see the album for that; **$36** **shipped** worldwide; 9 available

So far these have never been mounted and I am the second owner. I just bought these but they didn't end up matching the way I wanted with a build and the spacebar is warped so you'll need to fix that hence me making it a bit cheaper than what I bought it for.

Hi everyone, I'm trying to liquidate most of my collection to free up some cash.

Prices do not include shipping, shipping will be a flat rate split between us (usually around $15/2). Priority goes to local cash or e-transfer, with an additional 5% off the total. PM me for meetup options in Toronto. Prices are quoted in USD, I'll also entertain offers for bulk purchases.

I lubed with Krytox 205g0 on the stabs; 65g TX Spring swap; TX Spring oil on the springs; White TX switch film.  These are nasty smooth just like the 70g above.

~~RealForce 23UB Numpad~~ | I~~ bought this, but I don't use it and just sits in a drawer.  Unfortunately, I don't have the original packaging.  Condition is mint and effectively unused.~~ | ~~$75~~ SOLD - thanks to buyer!
~~Apple AEK II M3501~~ | ~~I recently purchased this from another r/mm user.  It has lubed alps dampened creams.  It is very smooth, and I re-lubed the space bar stabs so there is zero rattle to this.  The case is extremely clean.  I will ship with an ADP cable and an ADP to USB converter box that I purchased off of eBay so you can start using right away.  Works well with Mac and PC, and fully programmable.  Selling this because it's not my thing.  I thought I was going to harvest the alps and caps for another build, but I have a pile of boards I need work on so I'd rather just sell for now.~~ | ~~$105~~ (Sold - thank you to the buyer!)
 
-----  

Note: I have a few more vintage boards I will be working on in the coming days as well.  Additionally, these older WYSE boards also have vintage screw-in stabs (space bar only unfortunately) so those will be coming available too.  And of course, the left over plate mount stabs.  It's been really cool working on these old boards and digging up their ""buried treasures"" and history.


For international shipping, we would have to work out a price depending on where it would be shipping to.

Located in Japan, will ship worldwide. It's been a long time since I've posted or kept up with mm so please bear with me on prices and make an offer if you think something's unreasonable. Thanks!

##### Shipping options:

- $12 tracked airmail (1-2 week delivery time, package weight <1kg)
- $24 tracked airmail (1-2 week delivery time, package weight 1-2kg)
- Can use EMS for speed (<1 week delivery time), price starts at $20 for 500g
- For heavier packages like keyboards (over 2kg) please ask me for a quote. Oftentimes EMS is the best option for shipping out a single keyboard (arrives in a few days and costs around $40-50). Alternatively, surface mail can take a few months but is always cheap.

### NEC PC-8801 Blue Alps Keyboard

- Very clean 8801 with Blue Alps (grey switchplate). Old 15-pin connector.
- Haven't verified functionality but keys all feel great, opened to check switchplate and slider, feel 9/10, only some slight dust on the bottom of the switch, nothing in the top housing.
- Case and keycaps (katakana dye-sub pbt alphas, doubleshot abs alphas) are unyellowed
- Caps appear to be relatively unused without much shine. Original texture seems to be all there. 
- Original coil/cable in good condition and clean as well.
- Plate has some chipped spots. Gave it a wipe down. I have a plate in better condition that I could include as a spare if desired.
- I don't own an adapter but I could purchase one for you ($30) from a Japanese seller or check out deskthority for some DIY guides

Price: $250

___________________

### Switches

- If you need more or less switches than the quantity listed just PM and I might have extras.
- Add SKCM Lock switches for $1 each

##### SKCM Dampened White x100

- They feel fine for what they are but they're not my thing. Good for spare parts or matias substitute.

Price: $10 (0.1/switch)

##### Cherry MX Black x80

- Not vintage but still fairly smooth from use. Can provide closeups of stems if desired. Don't have cherries to compare them to but quite similar to stock gateron in terms of smoothness. 

Price: $20 ($0.25/sw)

##### ~~SKCM Salmon x78~~ SOLD

- 7/10 salmons, dusty, some scratchiness.
- Needs cleaning / dusting, lube recommended.

Price: $40 ($0.50/sw)

_________________________

### Apple AEK 2 M0312J 

- like new aek2 with JP caps. Case is remarkably clean and non-yellowed, caps and case are pretty much the same tone of Apple beige. 
- Switches feel clean for what they are (dampened whites)
- can build pro micro hasu adb adapter for $15 (required to use, board uses adb)
- includes adb cable

Price: $150

_________________________

### Apple M0116J

- Good condition Apple Keyboard with JP caps. Case and caps could use some cleaning.
- Switches are Alps Salmon but they're easily 9 or 10 / 10, they feel light and clean with no binding. 
- can build pro micro hasu adb adapter for $15 (required to use, board uses adb)
- Includes original box and adb cable. I can also include a spare outer case if needed.

Price: $150

### Toshiba J3100GL spare keyboard

A spare part for the Japan-exclusive version of the T3100 ""laptop"" computer, a bit different from the one I had last time as this one was marked for the GL variant. This is the last one of these that I have, haven't been able to find any more. These use Alps Common Mount Low Profile (SKFM/SKFN), but still have OG Alps doubleshots with lots of Hiragana sublegends (and some printed front legends as well!). The color scheme is a white text on very light grey, with slightly darker grey mods - like a lower contrast Oblivion/MoDo. 

- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/z3sAS3u
- [The KLE layout for the GT version.](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/8a06796d2c16c3ac42eb5387351cc586) I haven't drawn one up for this version yet.
- Alps SKFL, PCB Mount. PCB cloth cover missing. However, plastic cover + original Alps manufacturer sticker remains on the back.
- OEM profile Alps-made thick doubleshot keycaps with Hiragana sublegends. The legends are fairly normal compared to the one sold last time but this one has lots of nice, contrasting orange text on some of the utility keys. Compared to the other J3100 GL I had, this has slightly more wear but still overall good condition. Dropped the price to account for that though.

Price: $80

_________________________

### Keycaps

##### Apple AEK II JP Keycaps

- Apple Alps dye-subbed keycaps with JP sublegends, in extremely good condition. Spacebar is non-yellowed but has a bit of shine. Spacebar comparison to NOS: https://imgur.com/a/4sgFqzb
- Mexico-made with dark/bold black dyesub
- Includes stabilizers, clips, mounts.

Price: $120

##### Apple IIGS Keycaps

- Apple Alps dye-subbed keycaps, AEK profile but in the square-shaped IIGS shape. Identical to m0116 BUT number row is rotated 90-degrees so not recommended unless you have either a Planck-esque keyboard or a IIGS in need of caps

Price: $20

~~##### NEC PC8801 Keycaps, dye-sub alpha / ABS doubleshot mods~~ sold

- Alphas in great condition but the mods are yellowed. No stabilizers.
- katakana sublegend for alphas

Price: $30

##### ~~NEC PC8801 Keycaps, good condition doubleshots~~ sold

- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/J8HDiQn
- Caps in good condition, very slight yellowing on alphas, somewhat inconsistent but stronger on the numpad. Overall pretty good looking if planning on just using alphas. Numpad and some mods could use retrobright. 
- Medium-thick Alps doubleshot ABS keycaps with Hiragana sublegends, interesting non-standard mods with katakana legends. Convex space keys are singleshot with some front pad-printing. 
- Profile is very similar to OEM Profile, can be mixed with Taihao and the like.
- Includes stabilizers, clips, mounts
- Price: $80

##### ~~GMK Oblivion stuff from V2~~ SOLD

- ~~Hagoromo Alphas.~~ They're sealed but the packaging is bad so that jumble inside of the plastic wrap is how I received it. All the keys seem to be there though. $100.
- ~~Oblivion Vim kit (partial)~~ - selling the white HJKL keys + grey keys with White Vim logo. $10

* Pexon cable double sleeved micro USB, is super nice including as not many people have a micro usb cable for this board.

Notes: This board came from the factory with some paint scuffs, I'll not say it's perfect but the damage isn't noticable from the top down/ when using/displaying the board, only when you pick it up look around etc. See pics

~~I got this thing and while it's a very nice board, it's not for me. I don't need a 75 percent, or knob or screen. It's built with chisto-lubed zeal stabs and the older tangerine switches (not the new translucent ones, these have black bottom and milky top) lubed with 3204 and filmed. I ran out of switches for the 3 on the right, those are lubed gateron glow switches. I used a 60% MKUltra foam for that area and added a bit of foam to supplement by the cluster of keys on the right, and a piece of foam from Michael's that I cut to fit under the PCB. JTK toxic is not included, but the case it came with and knob are.  **Trades only** See below for trade interests. If I don't find a trade I like in a few weeks maybe I'll sell it, I'll list it then. *Don't ask me to DM you if I decide to sell it, I won't remember.~~

It has a brass plate and hot swap PCB (I can't remember if that was an option or the standard). It's got silent inks and generic stabs that are christo-lubed and I think bandaided. I used this board at work (I don't type a ton, but some) for a few months, the plate has some discoloring as you can see in the pics (I think my poor lighting makes it look worse in the pic, but idk). There's also a small nick in the top left, it's not very noticeable, but it's there, see pics. **I was thinking $500 or trades**, if not a trade, and if for some reason you don't want the silent inks 450 (I don't have a switch puller so it's a pain to take them out...).~~

As pictured, includes black PBT DSA blanks. Has a cherry MX Blue on escape, and otherwise is Matias click. This was the first kit I ever built, and I really just don't care for the switches.

**Want**

I got this really beautiful set with a really nice numpad that I want to show off, and I don't have a keyboard with a numpad to put it on. I'd really like an HBCP or maybe a TXCP to show off handarbeit on. I also might be interested in a blue-grey QXP.

Hey guys, I have some items to sell

All prices include PayPal fees and shipping. Invoice only. As usual please comment before DM.

**1.** **Salvun comissioned artisans.**

I have some artisans that I commissioned Salvun with. I wanted them for myself but there are MOQs and all that jazz, so selling extras. In total 21 were made, 11 are b-stock (old CNC) and 10 are a-stock (new Haas CNC), machining is really high quality on both though. There are 8 of a-stock and 9 of b-stock remaining. MX stem, R1 (Esc row), Alu with anodizing and laser engraving, the design is an occult symbol of the MX stem.

**A-stock**, black box, perfect ano and engraving; **$48** **shipped** worldwide; 6 available

**B-stock**, yellow box, there are some ano blemishes here and there but mostly on the sides, engraving is not as clear as well, see the album for that; **$36** **shipped** worldwide; 9 available

Selling my AbelX commando because right after building it I realized that TKL Matrix PCBs aren't programmable.

The  board is flawless, and has been desoldered with a Hakko Fr-301. The PCB  has been cleaned/tested after desoldering, and everything works. [Here's an album with some pics after i built it.](https://imgur.com/a/ukdauXH)

Looking to get back what I paid for it, so **€690 shipped inside of EU**. Let me know if you want it and you're outside of EU so i can calculate total price including shipping.

Also, been looking to complete my SodieCaps x GMK copper collection. Still need copper Elok and Pilgrim, will reward handsomely $$$!

It has  the white badge and will come with the box and everything it was shipped  with. I should note as well that this was built with GMK screw in stabs  which has the gasket touching the case as you'll see in the pictures.  Hasn't affected the case or the typing experience in anyway.

Hello everyone! As usual, hoping to recoup a few expenses. That being said, I am interested in purchasing a THE60 case in black if you have one you're willing to part with though.

&nbsp;

Item| Price| Available| Comments|
:---|:--- |:--- |:--- |
GMK Serika Geometries| $75 shipped| Y | Brand new and sealed in tray.
DSA Milkshake Bundle #1: (TKL, Weirdo Alphas, Forties, Ortho, Fruits)| $285 shipped| **SOLD**| Brand new and never used. Purchased this bundle internationally because I needed a couple of kits, but don't need the rest, and so I'm selling. Luckily, the leftover kits from the bundle I purchased will cover a good amount of boards.
DSA Milkshake Bundle #2: (Weirdo Alphas, Forties, Spacebars, RBYP, Blanks)| $200 shipped| **SOLD**| Purchased these as duplicates and have since conceded that I don't really need a third set. They were very slightly used by the previous owner, except for the RBYP kit. I got the RBYP kit about a year ago from a different person, and they're new as far as I know, but the kit is missing some keys. I've included a [picture](https://imgur.com/IWLsRsM) of the included keycaps.

Hello,

I have for sale a GMK Triumph Alder set, and an U87 Realforce. 

 
I am asking $125 for the TA GMK - open to offers because of the missing key. Not sure what the market for a complete set is. So if someone has a good idea let me know.

I am asking $180 for the RF U87.


The Triumph Alder set has been my DD on my leopold, but there is no sign of any shining. No scratches or anything like that. The only issue is that I lost the ""Z"" key. I have one of the blank key caps on the z key, and it dosent bother me. Does not include the pokemon aluminum keycaps or the space bar- that is part of a different set. 


The Realforce is a 2nd hand keeb so I don't know the full history, but I have been using it as a DD at work for about a year. Nothing wrong with it, but the keys could use a little cleaning. This is my grail keyboard TBH, but I need money to invest right now. Comes with windowed caps locks, and insert? key. Also comes with OEM key puller. I am also throwing in a specialty-run orange ""realforce"" key from a massdrop RF 10-numpad drop from a few years back. I dont have any use for it without a topre keeb anymore.


If you have question or need more pictures please ask. I will not respond to PMs if you do not comment in the thread.

I usually am able to ship for $5 domestically. If international people are interested then I can check international shipping rates.

**\*SOLD FOR ASKING\***

Selling my beloved KBDFans 8X keyboard. This was my intro into keyboard builds, the one that got me into the game. I have however migrated to an hbcp, and I have no more need for this board. This is  from the first round of the keyboard with USB-Mini. It is assembled with the following:

* 62g Vintage Black Switches (SPRiT gold springs)
* SPRiT 24K Cherry stabilizers (clipped and lubed)
* Black Aluminum Plate (SS Plate included as well)

I am also including a wooden wrist rest, an old school coiled cable from Zap Cables. For everything, I was looking for **~~250 USD~~** **SOLD**. Shipping is at your own cost from Canada. I will not be splitting, and priority goes to local buyers since pickups are always easier than shipping. Only trades I would consider would be for GMK Minimal, the RAMA Minimal Kuro and the WoB/BoW icon mods.

- 7/10 salmons, dusty, some scratchiness.
- Needs cleaning / dusting, lube recommended.

Price: $40 ($0.50/sw)

##### SKCM Dampened White x100

- Dampened whites. They feel fine for what they are but they're not my thing.
- ~~will include a bunch of spare sliders and bottom housings. Also some linear tops.~~

Price: $10 (0.1/switch)

##### ~~SKCM Dampened Cream x100~~ SOLD

- Dampened creams. Little less tinny-sounding than the whites, could go a long with way linearization or undampening, and clean/lube.

Price: $20 (0.2/switch)

##### ~~Cherry MX Black x80~~ SOLD

- Not vintage but still fairly smooth from use. Can provide closeups of stems if desired. Don't have cherries to compare them to but quite similar to stock gateron in terms of smoothness. 
- Can also lube with Tribosys 3204 or Krytox 205 (+$0.40 / switch) OR will sell you an unused vial of either for $6 for DIY

Price: $20 ($0.25/sw)

### NEC PC-8801 Blue Alps Keyboard

- https://imgur.com/a/y0Yugrr
- Very clean 8801 with Blue Alps (grey switchplate). Old 15-pin DIN connector.
- Haven't verified functionality but keys all feel great, opened to check switchplate and slider, which seem to be in good condition with low dust.
- Very little if any yellowing on the case and the keycaps (katakana dye-sub pbt alphas, doubleshot abs alphas).
- Plate has some chipped spots but still holding on fine. Gave it a wipe down. 
- Caps appear to be relatively unused without much shine. Original texture seems to be all there. 
- Original coil/cable in good condition and clean as well.
- I don't own an adapter but I could purchase one for you ($30) from a Japanese seller or check out deskthority for some DIY guides

- Found it at an estate sale. Came in the original box, it's been babied and looks to be pretty much unused. If you don't know this keyboard please watch this, it's really something: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZXrYreLZxM
- The switches are alps clones but they're clean and crisp feeling clickies. I like them quite a bit more than whites I usually find on boards or even some montereys (personal preference). Coupled with the case, it makes quite a racket. Can provide typing video for the interested buyer.
- I've confirmed the keyboard is working - the battery compartment had some bad corrosion but cleaned it up + swapped in a new 3.6v and it was fine. It comes with a 5-pin DIN to PS/2, which in turn can be converted to USB using any store-bought active adapter. However, the calculator LCD screen is dying (as you can see in the picture, the tens and hundred place don't show properly, all the other places are fine). Would definitely recommend either not using said functionality (boo) or considering the calculator replacement option chyros took in his video.
- All the other doodads in the original box are also there, like the function key paper strips, an operator's guide, and some business reply registration postcard for some shell of Focus in Walnut CA. The big coil on the keyboard cable is still wrapped in plastic.;
- Also the caps are doubleshot. I pretty much bought this for the Turbo key and the wacky nav cluster.

Price: $120

### Apple AEK 2 M0312J 

- like new aek2 with JP caps. Case is remarkably clean and non-yellowed, caps and case are pretty much the same tone of Apple beige. 
- Switches feel clean for what they are (dampened whites)
- can build pro micro hasu adb adapter for $15 (required to use, board uses adb)
- includes adb cable

Price: $150

_________________________

### Apple M0116J

- Good condition Apple Keyboard with JP caps. Case and caps could use some cleaning.
- Switches are Alps Salmon but they're easily 9 or 10 / 10, they feel light and clean with no binding. 
- can build pro micro hasu adb adapter for $15 (required to use, board uses adb)
- Includes original box and adb cable. I can also include a spare outer case if needed.

Price: $150

### Toshiba J3100GL spare keyboard

A spare part for the Japan-exclusive version of the T3100 ""laptop"" computer, a bit different from the one I had last time as this one was marked for the GL variant. This is the last one of these that I have, haven't been able to find any more. These use Alps Common Mount Low Profile (SKFM/SKFN), but still have OG Alps doubleshots with lots of Hiragana sublegends (and some printed front legends as well!). The color scheme is a white text on very light grey, with slightly darker grey mods - like a lower contrast Oblivion/MoDo. 

- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/z3sAS3u
- [The KLE layout for the GT version.](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/8a06796d2c16c3ac42eb5387351cc586) I haven't drawn one up for this version yet.
- Alps SKFL, PCB Mount. PCB cloth cover missing. However, plastic cover + original Alps manufacturer sticker remains on the back.
- OEM profile Alps-made thick doubleshot keycaps with Hiragana sublegends. The legends are fairly normal compared to the one sold last time but this one has lots of nice, contrasting orange text on some of the utility keys. Compared to the other J3100 GL I had, this has slightly more wear but still overall good condition. Dropped the price to account for that though.

Price: $80

### Keycaps

##### GMK Oblivion stuff from V2

- Hagoromo Alphas. They're sealed but the packaging is bad so that jumble inside of the plastic wrap is how I received it. All the keys seem to be there though. $100.
- ~~Rama Oblivion Artisan. $80~~
- Oblivion Vim kit (partial) - selling the white HJKL keys + grey keys with White Vim logo. $10

##### Apple AEK II JP Keycaps

- Apple Alps dye-subbed keycaps with JP sublegends, in extremely good condition. Spacebar is non-yellowed but has some slight shine.
- Mexico-made with dark/bold black dyesub
- Includes stabilizers, clips, mounts. These are in great condition, nice and springy plastic.

Price: $130

##### Apple IIGS Keycaps

- Apple Alps dye-subbed keycaps, AEK profile but in the square-shaped IIGS shape. Identical to m0116 EXCEPT number row is rotated 90-degrees so not recommended unless you have either a Planck-esque keyboard or a IIGS in need of caps

Price: $20

##### NEC PC8801 Keycaps, dye-sub alpha / ABS doubleshot mods

- Alphas in great condition but the mods are yellowed. No stabilizers.
- katakana sublegend for alphas

Price: $30

##### NEC PC8801 Keycaps, good condition doubleshots

- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/J8HDiQn
- Caps in good condition, very slight yellowing on alphas, somewhat inconsistent but stronger on the numpad. Overall pretty good looking if planning on just using alphas. Numpad and some mods could use retrobright. 
- Medium-thick Alps doubleshot ABS keycaps with Hiragana sublegends, interesting non-standard mods with katakana legends. Convex space keys are singleshot with some front pad-printing. 
- Profile is very similar to OEM Profile, can be mixed with Taihao and the like.
- Includes stabilizers, clips, mounts
- Price for good condition: $80
- Price for slightly yellowed: $40

##### ~~Sharp X1 Keycaps~~ SOLD

- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/PUR0hRD
- Alps-made, alps-mount ABS doubleshot keycaps. Katakana sublegend and standard length ANSI mods for the left-hand side. Non-standard for right side, kind of a weirdly modified JIS with L-enter. 
- Profile is very similar to OEM profile. Numpad is all uniform R3.
- Inconsistent yellowing across the set, needs retrobrighting. Grey on grey color scheme is pretty cool and should make for a an easier time retrobrighting without as much danger of bleaching.
- Includes stabilizers, clips, mounts

Price: $30

##### ~~Alps doubleshots~~ SOLD

- I bought them from another user on here half a year ago, I don't recall the keyboard they came from, in good condition but slight yellowing.
- https://ibb.co/khmDwxx $40

Misc

##### Shiny steel Iris plates 

- cut by laserboost. standard Iris plates, 1.5mm thick MX-alps hybrid mounts, nice and hefty and shiny. Was planned to be used in build but I lost them for a few months. Only the top plates here. I have a set of acrylic bottoms but they are for a fullhand case and not the standard one.

Price: $60

##### Acrylic Laser cut case for CRKBD

- from the Hedgey group buy a while back, unused and A-stock version, comes with all necessary mounting hardware.
- pic from the GB https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/arz096/gb_cornehelidox_full_acrylic_case/

Bunch of extra parts + icons extension since I found 40% keyboards/didn't want to deal with gmk pricing/sound for abs now that Kat is a thing.

Roselio housings are spares from making red roses switches, has original springs and stems are 39 red ink, 6 cherry clear stems and only other linears are retooled reds so ask for those at your own risk. Would recommend just using aliaz housings for the rest or going for some red inks. (Willing to lube/spring swap these for extra cash)


**Prices**

GMK WOB/BOW icons extension kit $120(Also willing to split for wob80 bow90 shipped)

Roselios housings+stems $30

All prices shipped to conus, willing to give discount for multiple things bought. Maybe fcfs maybe not really just depends on my laziness/how messages come in. 

As to trades I'm interested in pbt caps, switches of different sorts(frankens are fun) or 40s/65% boards but not expecting much there so send offers for anything at all(and I mean anything since that seems fun to open up to) it and worst case I just say no.

Hi Everyone,

Below are some items I'm looking to sell since they don't get a lot of use and should go to a good home.

I'm looking to purchase or trade for a HB85 and also a duck eagle/viper pcb.


~~CA66 - WKL in gray with brass plate. It comes with 1 bluetooth pcb that has mill-max sockets soldered in so its hotswappable and also a battery that should last a couple months without charging. Also comes with a brand new unused default pcb and a foam spacer for between the pcb and plate to reduce sound. A couple little nicks that I've tried to take pics of but nothing that bothered me personally. $450 for the whole kit.~~


~~GMK Pulse Micons and Hangul - Excellent condition. Used for only a couple hours then back into the bags. Looking to sell as a combo but will split if 2 buyers. $150.~~


~~68x black ink switches lubed with 205g0. Butter smooth. $70~~


~~GMK Honeywell - There is a little shine on some alphas and the 6 key has been melted a little bit as part of an unfortunate accident. Rest of the set looks great though. $100~~


~~Mill-max sockets - I'm not sure how many are here, it looks to be probably 100+ but I don't want to count. Haha. $15~~


~~Solder Sucker - I no longer have a use for this as I now have a desolder gun. I only used this 1 time. $5 + shipping.~~


If you have any questions please ask :)

Also, if you are not from the USA, please let me know when you contact me.

SOLD 

Hi Mechmarket,

I'm looking to sell this beautiful TX CP V2 in Rose gold ano. Details as follows:

* Rose gold ano which is perfect with 0 flaws (as is the case with every TX finish)
* Chonker of a brushed brass weight (see pics)
* Extra STS plate and PCB (currently built with brass plate)
* Currently build with RETOOLED hako violets (does not break GMK keycaps. I've had GMK Carbon R2 on it for a while.)
* Lined with shelf liner on the inside with that sweet thock.
* Come with a TX bag.
* Indicator LEDs installed.

&#x200B;

I can desolder it if you want in case you do not like tactile switches but they feel really good plus I'm dropping them in more or less for free, so take them :). You'll anyways have a spare PCB to have another build with.

I paid $600 for this with all extras and shipping from Kin.

&#x200B;

Asking price -> $675 shipped CONUS

&#x200B;

The reason for the price is because I'll ship it in a TX bag. Please do not ask me to ship it without one as this is a chonky keyboard and I'm worried with it shipping without a bag. So the shipping would be at least $40 at my end with the rest going into covering paypal fees.

The price is of course OBO. Please post here before sending me a PM.

Hello. I'm new to trading here so apologies if I'm doing it wrong. I'm also aware of my abysmal comment karma as a result of basically never posting or commenting, but hey I guess everybody's gotta start somewhere lol. I totally get any apprehension though.
 

Anyways, reason for selling: I won't have a board to throw these on for awhile thanks to the savage lineup of GBs this year already, so just looking to sell.

Can definitely knock a couple bucks off if bundling, or if you happen to be in the Phoenix metro area, could even do a local 


I'm gonna keep it simple. PayPal goods and services, and I pay the USPS Priority tracked shipping (CONUS only). Package ships same/next business day at the latest so typical delivery expectation should be within 3-4 days payment for most of the US.

Hey there!

Selling today my **Keycult No. 2 Rev. 1** that I won from the raffle last July as well as the **Rama x Keycult Brass** **artisan keycap**. I'm only willing to sell both items together. Really did not want to let go of this keyboard but I already find TKLs a bit too big for my taste after getting used to 60s and 65s. The keyboard is #138 out of the 150 that was built. The only flaw are minuscule dots that could barely be seen in the second last photo.

Specs of the keyboard are as follows:

\-  **Keycult No.2 Rev.1 Windows Key (A-stock)**

\- Switches: Gateron black inks spring-swapped with 55g spirit springs apart from the spacebar which still uses the original 70g ink spring.

\- Stabilizers: GMK screw-in

\- Setup utilizes a 7u space bar as evident in the photos.

I'll be shipping from the Philippines through DHL in its original box. Will be including the Keycult card as well as the allen wrenches that came with the keyboard.

* KBDFans 8x Kit - 375$ USD OBO
* Massdrop GMK WoB - 125$ USD OBO

WANT:

* Equinox
* Rama Minimal Kuro
* GMK Minimal (with numpad)
* GMK Icon Mods (WoB and BoW)

KBDFans 8x R1/V1 - Assembled with:

* 62g R2 vintage blacks.
* SPRiT clipped and lubed gold stabilizers.

Built with the aluminum plate, but I'll include the extra aluminum plate, and an extra PCB that isn't working, but you can try to fix it. I've also included a coiled cable from Zap Cables, a wooden wrist rest, and some OG Cherry WoB keycaps (very shiny and worn). Asking for **350 USD**, but will accept a reasonable offer. A great first custom keyboard! Also looking to trade for a dark grey unassembled Equinox keyboard.

If splitting (negotiable within reason):

* 280$ Keyboard
* 15$ Wrist Rest
* 25$ Cable
* 85$ Keycaps

Massdrop GMK WoB set:

I'm looking at trading it for a GMK Minimal set with the numpad, and (if you have it) the add-on kit. Also if you've got the WoB/BoW icons, I can pay the difference. Slight issue with the scooped ""J"" key, minimal wear and shine on the set. Also willing to trade for a GMK Minimal Set with numpad and pay the difference **125 USD**

Hello, all prices shipped CONUS. GMK sets shipped without trays.

* Aluminum E-red HHKB case. Polycarb weight.

* (1x) Aluminum E-black HHKB plate. (1x) Polycarb HHKB plate. (1x) QMK programmable USB-C PCB (Your choice of hotswap or traditional)

* Seems all e-coated cases had issues in screws (dirt stuck), so I did the hard work of cleaning it, and all screws go in all the way now. There's a tiny bump in the top left of the case due to one of the screws pushing in too hard with all the extra added dirt. I tried to photograph it but it's barely noticeable. That screw works fine now, as well as all the others.

* Few micro-scratches, notably on the bottom left of the top case. I tried to photograph but it doesn't even seem noticeable enough for photographs.

* Keycaps/switches/stabs not included

Hi mechmarket, need some money to fund some animal crossing adventures soon so I'm selling some keysets and switches I have laying around.

&#x200B;

**~~60 x Gateron Black Inks:~~**

~~These are V1, but I'm unsure if these have leaf issues or not as I bought them lubed with 205g0 already. Never got around to putting these on a board, but the legs have been clipped already. If need 10 more for a full 65% build, I'll throw in 10 more Gateron Yellows (new) that have been lubed with 205g0 as well for an additional 5 USD.~~

**GMK Modern Dolch Base Kit + Icons Kit + 6.25u Red Mint Spacebar:**

The base kit was only typed on for around a week so none to very little shine overall. The only keys that I noticed shine on in the base kit was the grey 6.25u spacebar and more so on the mint green enter key as these were used for longer.

For the icons kit, only the 6 keys that were placed on the white cardboard were used for around a week, so I have not noticed any shine on them. The mint icon esc key has been used as an accent key on my board for awhile, so it does have some shine on it.

The extra 6.25u red spacebar was not used at all, but I have no use for it so I will include it altogether.

* There are small scratches on the brass plate since it is pvd, but obviously nothing will be seen with keycaps on.

I'm looking for a new home for my custom build based on the MF68 Magicforce 68 replacement PCB! This is a great PCB for folks who love the MIYA Pro/Magicforce 68 layout but want the flexibility of QMK firmware!

The case is comprised of a 1.6mm raw aluminum plate, 12mm brass standoffs, and several layers of 3mm frosted clear acrylic. Switches are milky top black bottom Gateron Yellows, all lubed with Tribosys 3204. To allow for easier servicing of plate-mounted stabs, all stabilized key locations have been outfitted with Mill-Max 0305 sockets, so there's no need to desolder if your stab wires need fixing or you want to refresh your application of lube! Just pull the switch, then slip the stabilizer out. Easy-peasy! :)

Authentic GMK/Cherry stabilizers are lubed and preinstalled for the spacebar and right Shift. You'll need to supply 3 sets of 2U plate-mount stabilizers for the remaining stabilized keys. (They were out of stock when I was wrapping up this build, and I moved onto another project before they became available again!)

There are three small and extremely light rubs in the frosted acrylic on the bottom of the case, which has caused these areas to appear shiny under direct light. I've circled them in the photo above! Obviously, these aren't visible from the top or sides of the board.

Board connects via Mini USB (cable not included). Any keycap set that supports a TKL board will work! No non-standard key sizes here ;)

I'd like to get **$110** \+ shipping for this build. Comment before PMing, please! Chat is disabled, so please PM directly. Thanks for looking!",[US-FL] [H] Custom MF68 (Magicforce 68/MIYA Pro Layout) Build + Gateron Yellows [W] PayPal

Roselio housings are spares from making red roses switches, has original springs and stems are 39 red ink, 6 cherry clear stems and only other linears are retooled reds so ask for those at your own risk. Would recommend just using aliaz housings for the rest or going for some red inks. (Willing to lube/spring swap these for extra cash)

Unholy pandas have clear springs so not much special there.

All prices shipped to conus, willing to give discount for multiple things bought. Maybe fcfs maybe not really just depends on my laziness/how messages come in. 

As to trades I'm interested in pbt caps, switches of different sorts(frankens are fun) or 40s/65% boards but not expecting much there so send offers for anything at all(and I mean anything since that seems fun to open up to) it and worst case I just say no.

Hey y’all! 

Up for sale is my Space65. I love this board dearly but the 65% layout is just not for me. I thought I’d like it but alas I still find myself using my 60% more. This build will be sold to fund another 60%. It is built with C3 r2 tangerines lubed with 206g00 (the new ones with uhmwpe housings) swapped to 60g springs lubed with Krytox 107. 7u space and split backspace, zeal stabs. **Asking $550 shipped conus obo.** PENDING BUNDLE

I also have GMK Serika Base. It’s mounted as you can see but as stated this board hasn’t gotten much use so absolutely no shine on any keys. Like new condition, want **$300 shipped conus** PENDING BUNDLE 

Swiftshells coiled usb-c cable, used for a couple weeks works well. Great condition the tech flex is done quite well. **$45 shipped conus** PENDING BUNDLE

I will bundle everything here together for $860 shipped CONUS. Willing to split but not FCFS and will prioritize bundles and local deals in the Sacramento area.

**Norbaforce:** [Album](https://imgur.com/a/rPcy37r#gcjVJc7) I really enjoyed the top mount topre experience, but the front height of the board is too much for my wrists personally. Case is almost in perfect condition, only defects being a very thin white streak on the bottom right of the case, and some marks on the aluminum backplate and around the screw holes. **Looking for $315 shipped**

**Realforce:** [Album](https://imgur.com/a/T6zqZY7#1UeqJsi) The 10th Anniversary Edition. Has the grey-blue color scheme with a dark navy blue case. Has BKE ultralights and lights installed (see album for configuration). ***Does not include stock domes.*** Slider rails are lubed with mechlube 2 and the stabs have been greased to reduce rattle. The previous owner stripped a screw of its head and messed up the screw heads of 2 others. Got some replacements from McMaster and put them in, and while the screw head is a bit smaller, they still work fine. The missing screw does not affect keyfeel or operation at all. Will include 10 additional screws, as well as the included keycaps (ctrl-caps swap, red esc, blue wasd cluster) **Looking for $195 shipped**


~~**Fujitsu:** [Album](https://imgur.com/a/h98BrLn#je44eB7) Has the rare variant of 3rd gen fujitsu leaf spring, that being the clicky version. All in a Tandy 3000, which can easily be converted for use on modern systems. Cleaned the case, keycaps, plate, and the innards, though a lot of scratches and marks still remain on the case. Unsure if there's any binding. Only case I've found is the 'T' key, but pressing the key in the exact same position doesn't lead to any binding. Otherwise keyfeel is still fine, even for the well-used alpha block to which the keycaps have shine to them. All keys work except for F6 and maybe the system request key. **Looking for $110 shipped CONUS**~~ **SOLD**

~~**GMK Oblivion Cadet:** Used for less than an hour **45 shipped**~~ **SOLD**

~~**Alpacas:** Have 111x of them that are installed with white films and invyr stems. Completely stock otherwise. Also has 4 other unfilmed ones that are ""B-Stock"", meaning weird stems or alpacas that don't feel as smooth. **Looking for $135 shipped**~~ **SOLD**

~~**Silent Alpaca Stems:** 115x count. Unsure if these stick upon being lubed (if anyone can confirm if gateron silents stick when freshly lubed that would be nice). The dampening material on these is not integrated to the stem, but rather dampening material stuck to the sides of the stem. **Looking for $20 shipped**~~ **SOLD**

Hey r/mechmarket, selling a board I bought last week as the colors don’t quite match up and I just can’t seem to vibe with the switches. Always on the lookout for interesting trades so feel free to give me a holler.

**BOARD:** [imgur](https://imgur.com/a/RRD98Lz)

- LJD61UP case painted white, black cone feet on bottom and black “Akira” vinyl
- GMK screw in stabs lubed and band aid modded
- Lightly lubed gateron blacks with painted tops

There one place on the top plate where it might’ve been rubbed as well as some bubbling on the bottom plate, nothing too serious. Vinyl can be removed if you don’t like it.

**Norbatouch + GMK HFO + gothcap hfo blank + pexon cable cable**

Colour: Retro Refridgrator Blue

Includes: 

* an ISO novatouch with BKE heavy domes and the stock dome sheet. Don't have the novatouch case or stock caps.
* GMK Hyperfuse Origins. Full base set, used but in good condition, not much shine. 
* A gothcaps HFO blank.
* Pexon cable double sleeved micro USB, is super nice including as not many people have a micro usb cable for this board.

Notes: This board came from the factory with some paint scuffs, I'll not say it's perfect but the damage isn't noticable from the top down/ when using/displaying the board, only when you pick it up look around etc. See pics

Price: $700/£510 or trade for blue Mira SE. Will ship internationally but you have to conver shipping. I'm losing money on this so not too negotiable on the price. **Wont split HFO unless someone buys the case on it's own.**




**KF Orochi** - Specter has never been mounted, so stem is super tight. Salt was mounted on a board for awhile so fits on a switch nicely.

* £60/$75 shipped UK each, £100/$130 together.

Ignore the random photo of my backpack and all my stuff.

edit3: I also am looking for design help for a 3d printed case. I already have most of the work done but just need some small stuff.  

I am interested in an ergo split board like the iris, ergodox  Quefrency etc. I am also interested in pretty much any GMK set, I want to see what the hype is about. I also need switch lube. If you see something you want make an offer and convince me why I need it, I'm gullible.

\## Items and Description

\*\*Raid tower\*\*

I got this used and thought I could just get an esata to sata connector and it would work but after looking I need an esata controller. Not really that interested in it anymore. If you want to buy this outright I don't really know the price. I will say $70 but prove to me that's too much and I can go lower. My little bit of research says thats ok. Also you can have my esata to sata connector if you want it takes up a slot on those little removable parts of your pc where your video card slot goes.

&#x200B;

\*\*Hard drives\*\*

I got these used as well for the raid tower. They are both in good condition and work, you can see the power on hours of both from crystaldiskinfo are 95 hours. I assume they were pulled out of the same server or something? I am seeing these on ebay for around $70 a piece. Ill let both go for 120 and if you get raid tower with it you can have all 3 items for 150.

\*\*Lube stations\*\*

One is single switch but a switch opener as well. It works pretty well as an opener. The other is a 15 switch station. $5 each, maybe I can throw in with something else if you purchase enough.

&#x200B;

\*\*HyperX Cloud Flight II\*\*

Got these used. I am a used shopper as you can see. They are in great condition, I just prefer my arctic 7s for the wireless functionality. The mic is a little finicky if you do not plug it in all the way but it works and also it has the luxury of being replaceable since it is detachable.  I think these are worth $40.

&#x200B;

\*\*Corsair C70 LOCAL ONLY 92835 AND SURROUNDING or PASADENA\*\*

OK this guys beefy and served me well since like 2015. Recently upgraded to Lian Li O11 though and its been sitting in my closet since. As you can see I am an Earth scientist. I think this is worth about $30. The back panel is slightly warped. It will still go back on but be warned, it is a fucking pain in the ass. You really have to fiddle with it. I always dreaded changing components because I knew 20 minutes would have to be taken to put this bitch back on.

* TGR 910RE + 2 Hannah 910 PCBs + 2 Hannah Plates - $1850

Just not getting enough love for the moment. Figured someone else might like it, so here it is. 

Last chance for this one. 

Built by /u/LightningXI, has lubed vintage MX Blacks with 58.5g springs, they were aftermarket purchases so I'm not 100% sure on the lube used but they feel perfect. No scuffs on the board itself, handled with care so except for the stray markings on the polycarb because thats the nature of polycarb. [Only slight markings on the weight, nothing crazy they look very shallow.](https://i.imgur.com/DCSSQXp.jpg) 

Only comes with the board + the extra pcbs/plates, no keycaps. 

* GMK Modern Dolch - $375? idk, super OBO

Used for about a week, cemented that I don't like how abs feels or how it gets shiny kinda fast especially with how much i use my WASD and such.

But with that said, the quality is fine. Some texture is slowly whittling away particularly on WASD and the blue 7u spacebar, but otherwise still very pristine.  

Contains all kits, base/spacebars/icon mods, shipped in bag unless requested otherwise.

* Sticky Grape Mulder - $55
* ADAMSKI ""Starcluster"" Gamer - $220
* Tokkipee Andes Gamer - $30
* Tokkipee ??? Gamer - $30

[These are the Tokkipee gamers, sorry for bad lighting in timestamp, can't do much about required lights in apartment complex.](https://i.imgur.com/5QxCzNn.png) They come with Esc, WASD and an Fn. 

ADAMSKI Gamer doesn't have a name, but they look *very* similar to Bro's Starcluster/Starclusterfuck colorway so that's what I'm calling them. Comes with Esc, WASD and two Fns. These are Cherry profile, but they sit high on switches, its not an OEM profile because the angles match, they probably were prototypes of some sort. 

Only trades I'm looking for, that can give value towards buying too:

* OG / CRP / IMSTO Dyesubs
* OG POMs / Cherry Jelly POMs

Sales are not FCFS, bundles take priority. All prices include PP fees, but do not include shipping. Shipping in original packaging is strongly preferred. All products are unused and in original packaging unless otherwise stated. It's worth noting that GMK Camping r2 is on the way, in case you prefer waiting for that (I had trouble finding current pricing on r1).

For the artisans, I'm mostly looking for interesting trades. Particularly interested in simpler Birbs. None are intended for sale at the present time. B8 is no longer available.


Thanks for looking!

Edit: getting a lot of PMs - I hope to respond to all eventually, sorry if I'm not getting back to any one person. I'll keep this page up to date at the very least!","[US-MA] [H] GMK Camping, GMK Mizu, XDA Canvas, MT3 Godspeed, Heavy-6 Tactical Black , Artisans (Spooders/Keymo/more) [W] Paypal, Artisans (Birbs)"
