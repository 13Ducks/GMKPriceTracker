Have some things to sell / prod interest for today. I am looking for mostly PayPal, but am also interested in some RAMA Brass caps, or the polished aluminum caps for Thermal -- shiny things! Also interested if you may have a source for obtaining some cool ANIMAL CROSSING ARTISANS. Also interested in picking up an Enter Key from the GMK Striker kit -- apparently it comes with a normal blue enter and a darker blue enter ... I presume some people don't use the darker blue enter so I would be willing to take that if you don't use it!

Shipping is $3 CONUS.

**~~Milky Alpacas - $70~~ SOLD** 
-

I have 67 Milky Alpacas. They are built using Alpaca stems in Gateron milky housings, with Gateron yellow springs. Lubed with 205g0 on stems, 105 on springs. 60 of them are desoldered cleanly, though the heat does do a bit of yellowing on the base around the pins. They are good to be used in a hot swap without any issues. See photo for a representation of the bottoms / pins: [IMAGE](https://i.imgur.com/8qmhaW8.jpg). See here for a typing test: [TYPING TEST (unmute audio)](https://i.imgur.com/ng6ssip.mp4).

**[Leaf60 and extras - TRADES](https://imgur.com/a/QyqXvfd)**
-

I may be interested in trading for other e-white boards. If you would really like to buy it all as a bundle, I would consider $599 + shipping. Not looking to part anything other than the POM plate, unless you really really want something and are willing to pay a premium.

**Leaf60 e-white HHKB, desoldered PCB, e-white plate - NFS / $450**

Comes with a desoldered PCB -- this PCB has been desoldered a few times so it is in decent condition, completely functional and tested. May want to clean the flux off of it and misc. dielectric grease :P... There are some minor grey dots on the e-white finish, but from what I've heard it is hard to pull off a flawless e-white finish. A few small blemishes here and there, but mostly in fantastic condition. Comes with that sweet gold PVD brass weight. E-white plate is surprisingly in fantastic condition... beautiful plate.

**Leaf60 Hotswap PCB - NFS / $100**

Hotswap PCB. Used but good condition. Nothing wrong with it.

**Leaf60 Polycarbonate Plate - NFS / $35**

Polycarbonate plate. My favorite on the Leaf60 tied with the Aluminum plate. Decent condition.

**~~Leaf60 POM Plate - FOR SALE / $30~~ SOLD**

Comes in a black color. Misc. scratches. Cut by Worldspawn, very friendly and awesome person."

Good Evening /r/mechmarket 

**Minitomic Prototype**

~~This is a 45%, 13U wide board from Martenwuut originally.  I still don't think the GB has happened yet.  I picked this board up from another user a while ago and it came with Ergo Clears in it.  I desoldered those with a vacuum gun and put in 62g lubed Zilents along with a few lubed Gateron Black Inks.~~  

~~It has a Brass Plate and Lubed GMK Stabilzer.  This board is a lot of fun to use, and it has a USB-C port for the PCB.  The case is silver, and has really good weight to it, and it's flawless with 4 rubber bumpons.~~

~~This is a good board for someone to try and make the switch to a less than 60% board.~~  

HOWEVER - You will need to get the fork from Martenwuut's Github to program it as it's not on QMK Configurator yet.  I can help you get that if needed.

~~I'm asking $150 shipped CONUS with PP Fees included.~~

**SA Hyperfuse R2**

~~What's included in the set minus the 6U spacebar:  (See below)~~

https://www.originativeco.com/products/sa-hyperfuse

~~Picked up this set a few months ago and I barely use it.  It's been sitting on one of my boards but I realize that I'm not a huge SA fan anymore and these should go to someone who will use them.  There is light shine but this set is already smooth and shiny to begin with.  It's in near perfect condition otherwise.~~

~~When I bought the set, it didn't include the stock spacebars.  Only a 6.25U from what appears to be either SA Doom or SA Grand Budapest.  Either way it wasn't a perfect match, so I went ahead and ordered a 6.25U and 7U in the correct Grey color from PMK.  The 6.25U has been mounted and used, but the 7U is still BNIB.~~  

~~I'm asking $200 O.B.O. shipped with PP Fees included CONUS.~~

**WANT**

I'm also looking to separately purchase JTK Debut (PoW) if you have it.

These have never been mounted and I am the second owner. I just bought these but they didn't end up matching the way I wanted with a build and the spacebar gets stuck in the down position so you'll have to fix that hence me making it a bit cheaper than what I bought it for.

Open to offers on spacebar (or anything else). Yes asking is high, but it seems consistent with past sales.

Edit: I've added a couple more pictures to the album. I received a lot of PMs, these are most likely all spoken for, check your PMs after this post. Answering some common questions:

* Yes, I'm going to add shipping to the price, I will refund the difference of whatever isn't used for shipping.
* MiTo Laser Alt Dusk does not come with keycaps or switches, it does come with the extras (keycap puller, switch puller, limited edition key, sample switches).

* Local exchange is an option, you'll be doing most of the legwork in coming to me.

Final Edit: To bnaz17, the super tough internet warrior who ""could easily rip your throat out with just my thumb and pinky"" as he so eloquently put it, all you had to do was point out the pricing rules instead of sending silly baseless threats, take your keyboard fury elsewhere. I didn't know that the rules advise sending transactions as Goods and Services (because I didn't read them, my fault), I was repeating the process used when I bought these items over a year ago from this subreddit.

Hello,

I have for sale a GMK Triumph Alder set, and an U87 Realforce. 

 
I am asking $125 for the TA GMK - open to offers because of the missing key. Not sure what the market for a complete set is. So if someone has a good idea let me know.

I am asking $180 for the RF U87.

----------------------------------------

The Triumph Alder set has been my DD on my leopold, but there is no sign of any shining. No scratches or anything like that. The only issue is that I lost the ""Z"" key. I have one of the blank key caps on the z key, and it dosent bother me. Does not include the pokemon aluminum keycaps or the space bar- that is part of a different set. On a few of the close ups there is some dead skin built up. I just noticed that and will clean them up before I ship them out FYI.


The Realforce is a 2nd hand keeb so I don't know the full history, but I have been using it as a DD at work for about a year. Nothing wrong with it, but the keys could use a little cleaning. This is my grail keyboard TBH, but I need money to invest right now. Comes with windowed caps locks, and insert? key. Also comes with OEM key puller. I am also throwing in a specialty-run orange ""realforce"" key from a massdrop RF 10-numpad drop from a few years back. I dont have any use for it without a topre keeb anymore.


If you have question or need more pictures please ask. I will not respond to PMs if you do not comment in the thread.

I usually am able to ship for $5 domestically. If international people are interested then I can check international shipping rates.

- hotswappable PCB
- rgb underglow
- original kit has the top and bottom plate. I also 3d printed a case to cover all side of the keyboard. The case make it much more hefty and sturdy. See the board with case full pic [here](https://i.imgur.com/HiKYaor.jpg)
- gmk stab lubed
- and as always the board is working.

The bottom plate has some marks, hard to see under light so I tried my best to capture them in pictures. Please check the album for them

See the album [here](https://imgur.com/a/wtjp7hQ)

Asking for 70 gbp. SOLD.I do have 40 koalas tactile 62g switches and 7 yellow gateron (my habit of mixing linear with tactile in a board) for another 15gbp if you want. They are only used in this board so never been soldered and I bought them brand new. Keycaps you see WONT be included. That short little cable is included if you want. 

Paypal fee is on me, shipping is on the buyer. Given the circumstances, i will prioritize UK buyer since Im sure I can ship to them.

Oh one last thing I can flash it with whatever layout you want before sending it to you. Need help with that just ask.

Cheers and stay safe everyone!!"

~~Tanuki~~ | ~~Cute little 40% keyboard. RGB not installed, built with lubed T1 switches, plate foam and black/white DSA blanks. There's also enough blanks left over to cover maybe a 65% board. [Bottom is stickerbombed.](https://i.imgur.com/G6h5aBy.jpg)~~ | ~~90€ full set, cheaper without keycaps~~
~~Vinta 65%~~ | ~~Acrylic stack, custom edited. ISO layout, hipro bezel, plate foam, lubed Aliaz 70g and GMK screw-ins. Uses the KBD67 USB-C PCB with underglow, bottom is milky so it shines nicely. You can even install in-switch LEDs if you're into that. If it was a 75% I'd keep it. [More pictures](https://imgur.com/a/QiwM6Rk), there's a bit of white on the top bezel from epoxying multiple layers together - not really visible, but if you do mind a bit of sandpaper can easily fix that.~~ | ~~100€~~

Hi all- I have some stuff to sell today.

15x Nolives and 9x Zealios - $25 SOLD

These switches are unlubed. This comes with 1 H1 switch (see below).

70x KBDfans T1s - $40 SOLD

These switches are lubed with MGC 129. This comes with 2 H1 switches (see below).

34x Retooled MX Blacks - $10 SOLD

These switches are unlubed. This comes with 1 H1 switch (see below).

GMK White-on-Black - $85 SOLD

These keycaps have been used for about a month. All the keys in the original Drop set will be included, not just the ones in the picture. They will be shipped in a bag unless requested otherwise. This comes with 2 H1 switches (see below).

The goal of including H1 switches with each purchase is to allow some other members of the community to try the switches out before the full batch comes out. Obviously, posting your thoughts on the switch is suggested, but I can't enforce anything like that.

Have a good weekend everyone, and daily reminder to wash your hands!

GMK Nautilus Base Kit - Trade (STRONGLY preferred) or $240 + shipping cost, method of buyer's choice

I've had the Nautilus mounted for a few days now and I'm having second thoughts about the colorway. The naut has slight shining on WASD and surrounding keys (from the previous owner), but is otherwise great and is the full base. I'm mainly looking for [these keysets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sJQa_bM59gPAXXLIcwdNNI6Qj7qw5yryYH_gP0UiIDs/edit?usp=sharing) but I'm open to others. I'll be shipping in bags.

I'm really only interested in a trade. My endgame is one of the keysets on that list, if you 100% need this keyset and if I HAD to name a price I'd sell for 240 to guarantee being able to get a different keyset. 

Sorry if that's expensive, but I'm trying to avoid the hassle of waiting to find another seller as well."

Hello everyone! As usual, hoping to recoup a few expenses. That being said, I am interested in purchasing a THE60 case in black if you have one you're willing to part with though.

&nbsp;

Item| Price| Available| Comments|
:---|:--- |:--- |:--- |
GMK Serika Geometries| $75 shipped| Y | Brand new and sealed in tray.
~~DSA Milkshake Bundle #1: (TKL, Weirdo Alphas, Forties, Ortho, Fruits)~~| ~~$285 shipped~~| _SOLD_| ~~Brand new and never used. Purchased this bundle internationally because I needed a couple of kits, but don't need the rest, and so I'm selling. Luckily, the leftover kits from the bundle I purchased will cover a good amount of boards.~~
~~DSA Milkshake Bundle #2: (Weirdo Alphas, Forties, Spacebars, RBYP, Blanks)~~| ~~$200 shipped~~| _SOLD_| ~~Purchased these as duplicates and have since conceded that I don't really need a third set. They were very slightly used by the previous owner, except for the RBYP kit. I got the RBYP kit about a year ago from a different person, and they're new as far as I know, but the kit is missing some keys. I've included a [picture](https://imgur.com/IWLsRsM) of the included keycaps.~~

Boards and caps are mostly for sale, trades offers are welcome though. All prices are OBO and I'm always open to hearing offers, so feel free to pm me!

AL1: $349.98 shipped to US, OBO
Red top, black bottom, brass weight inside case. Built with Outemu Sky switches and stabs were clipped, lubed, and band-aid modded when put together. Great board, cool layout. Had some minor hiccups with the W key every so often, so I tried to jump it and it seems to have fixed the issue, however there are some wires on the backside of the PCB now because of it, works fine otherwise, can't tell they exist when put together. It does have a slight ding in the upper right corner of the case (originally received from GB this way), but it's barely noticeable, I tried taking two pictures of it, but it's hard to see, more pictures can be available on request, just ask. 

Gmk Skidata+ base, color pack, and relegendables: PENDING FOR $219.98PENDING
Love love love the colors, if I wasn't getting rid of the board I'd keep this set. There's some shine on the F and J keys, but I think for the most part they're fairly good. The major thing is that there is NO 'D' key. I don't know, it should be here somewhere, but I couldn't find it. Price is without 'D', if you want the 'D', I'll send it your way if I find it or I'll update my posts when I do, sorry. 

Let's Split: $29.99 shipped w/o caps
w/DSA Quartz: $65.
w/DSA Quartz and 2 gamer sets made by SpaceCaps: $89.98
Built for fun with Box Navy switches, has the acrylic case, lost the cords for it sadly. 

DSA Quartz: $49.99 shipped
Ortholinear Kit it seems, I used it only for the Let's Split, which hardly has any use, so these basically have just been mounted, hardly touched.

Synth v2.1?: $74.99 SOLD
Bought new, used only a couple of times, my sculpts were bad and I ran out of free time to try it anyways.

So far these have never been mounted and I am the second owner. I just bought these but they didn't end up matching the way I wanted with a build and the spacebar gets stuck in the down position so you'll have to fix that hence me making it a bit cheaper than what I bought it for.

Timestamps: [https://imgur.com/a/2nmN5fM](https://imgur.com/a/2nmN5fM)

Hey guys!:) Selling a whole bunch of GMK Yuri stuff. When this set came out a long time ago some of the row profiles were misprinted, and Massdrop sent out a small fix pack a few months afterwards. The sets that I'm selling here include the fix pack, so you end up with a few extra keys that have funky profiles which is kinda cool.

Only the base kit has been used for about 2 months. It's still pretty new, but there's just a tiny bit of shine starting to show. **Every other kit is brand new.** Unfortunately, the ""K"" keycap in the base kit has a bit of a chip in the back (shown in the pictures) but it's not very noticeable and pretty small.

For now I don't want to split the set unfortunately. The keycaps are in bags. I've attached a timestamp below with all of the keycaps in the Massdrop page display configuration so you can see that everything is there.

**GMK Yuri:**

Base Kit - $220

Cyrillics - $100

Icon Modifiers (with fix) - $80

Glorious - $20

Spacebars - $40

**Total - $460 + shipping**

If you buy it as a set we can do a bit of a discount, something like $430 + shipping. I'm open to offers though so just let me know. Only looking for PayPal however. Shipping within Canada is $10 and to CONUS is $15. Not shipping outside of North America at this time unfortunately.

Please let me know if you're interested!! :)"

Hey guys, strapped for cash atm and I need to sell my keyboard.

\- xd60/xd64 case, same as this one [here](https://drop.com/buy/xd60-xd64-custom-mechanical-keyboard-kit). Super nice, heavy full alu case, i filled the bottom with some shelf liner and it sounds and feels amazing.

\- gk61 hotswap pcb, you would have to use the gk61 software but its not as bad as some people make it seem to be. pretty decent customization and has rgb smd leds.

\- lubed(trib 3204), retooled, pink filmed cherry blacks. bought from here, they feel great.

\- alu plate

\- genuine cherry plate mount stabilizers, they dont feel/sound bad at all imo, despite plate mount not being as good as pcb/screw ins. had to buy these because the gk61 pcb doesn't support pcb mount for all keys.

\- [this keycap set](https://kbdfans.com/collections/keycaps/products/68keys-dye-sub-keycaps-set). as you can see, it comes with 1 less 1.5u and no 2.25u right shift. i bought black gmk singles from someone on here, which explains why i have those keys on the board. you can have the remaining keys if you want them.

[heres](https://vocaroo.com/hKBW2U9dfCP) a pretty scuffed sound test, im not sure why its so quiet, i had my mic on max. please don't hesitate to ask questions.

will be cleaned thoroughly ofc before shipping.

Keycaps come with tray and cardboard sleeve. The other varied height keycaps don't have the original plastic tray but are included in plastic baggy. Keycaps have a little shine, but the reflection in the timestamp photos look worse than in person. Looking for $220 shipped. Local to 90266 for in-person transactions.

I'm also looking for blank EnjoyPBT set in this colorway ( [https://kbdfans.com/products/enjoypbt-blank-keycaps-117keys?variant=36740706829](https://kbdfans.com/products/enjoypbt-blank-keycaps-117keys?variant=36740706829) ). Would consider this + paypal on your end as well.

Good Afternoon /r/mechmarket 

**154x Invyr Uhmwpe Stems**

~~Was planning on using these in a build but never got around to it.  Originally purchased the 110x from switchmod, but then purchased more from a discord user.  They were opened and 1 of them was lubed, but none were used.  Put back in the bag and sitting in my desk ever since.~~

Asking $60 shipped with PP Fees included CONUS

**SA Hyperfuse R2**

~~What's included in the set minus the 6U spacebar.  (See below)~~

https://www.originativeco.com/products/sa-hyperfuse

~~Picked up this set a few months ago and I barely use it.  It's been sitting on one of my boards but I realize that I'm not a huge SA fan anymore and these should go to someone who will use them.  There is light shine but this set is already smooth and shiny to begin with.  It's in near perfect condition otherwise.~~

~~When I bought the set, it didn't include the stock spacebars.  Only a 6.25U from what appears to be either SA Doom or SA Grand Budapest.  Either way it wasn't a perfect match, so I went ahead and ordered a 6.25U and 7U in the correct Grey color from PMK.  The 6.25U has been mounted and used, but the 7U is still BNIB.~~  

~~I'm asking $200 O.B.O. shipped with PP Fees included CONUS.~~


**WANT**

Besides Paypal, I'm looking for a base + 40's kit or something similar of either GMK, OEM, DSA, etc.. I'm really open to colorways at this time.  Show me what you got.  We can work + or - paypal on either end.

EDIT: I'm also looking to separately purchase JTK Debut (PoW) if you have it.

[Timestamp](https://imgur.com/gallery/tT8vNla?s=sms)

Today I have for you a TKL Leopold board with Cherry Silent Reds that have been spring-swapped to 62g gold-plated springs, as well as lubed.  These mods were not done by me, they were done by another redditor.  I have found that Leopold is by far the best prebuilt that you can buy, and the keycaps are on par if not better than ones that you can get from GMK. Will come in OG box, with all OG accessories. No shine on keycaps. Switches are just a bit heavy for me, thats all. 

For those that are looking for a frame of reference, I would compare the feel of the switches to the lubed Gat Silent Black Inks that I have.

Hey Y'all! I'm looking to do a few switcheroos on here to try getting a nice simple looking Keeb for work. Not smart enough to do my own build so just trying to really combine some colors I like.

The Keeb I am currently selling is my Ducky Miya Pro with cherry mx brown switches. Used very lightly because weeks later I won an O2M from a ducky giveaway.

The artisans I have for up are:

|Bro DFA Froper - $200 or trade|KRAP Franken Oso (trade)|Playyd Sonic the Hedgehog - $35/trade|
|:-|:-|:-|
|BOB Translucent Genger (SOLD)|Bad Laser Daffy v2 - $50/trade|Art Key OG Bearlot - (trade)|
||Bad Valentine Koala + Blank - (SOLD)||

Overall I'm looking to make some trades. Will consider sales but no promises.

Really hoping to find a Ducky One 2 full size white keys w/ white case. Preferably mx Blue, Brown, or Silver.

Would also love to find a set of the GMK UNIQEY-Blue keycaps, or GMK Cyan, or GMK Triumph Adler. As long as either comes in the full set to cover Num Pad as well.

And finally the White and Blue BAD Daffy White Walker Artisan

&#x200B;

I am willing to combine anything on here to hit my goal and can also include Paypal/venmo

Shipping can be negotiated. Prefer CONUS, but am willing to work with what I can get.

Aristans with prices are for sale as well as trade. Feel free to shoot me some cool offers!"

I have some artisans that I commissioned Salvun with. I wanted them for myself but there are MOQs and all that jazz, so selling extras. In total 21 were made, 11 are b-stock (old CNC) and 10 are a-stock (new Haas CNC), machining is really high quality on both though. There are 8 of a-stock and 9 of b-stock remaining. MX stem, R1 (Esc row), Alu with anodizing and laser engraving, the design is an occult symbol of the MX stem.

**A-stock**, black box, perfect ano and engraving; **$48** **shipped** worldwide; 3 available

**B-stock**, yellow box, there are some ano blemishes here and there but mostly on the sides, engraving is not as clear as well, see the album for that; **$36** **shipped** worldwide; 9 available

So far these have never been mounted and I am the second owner. I just bought these but they didn't end up matching the way I wanted with a build and the spacebar is warped so you'll need to fix that hence me making it a bit cheaper than what I bought it for.

~~Apple AEK II M3501~~ | ~~I recently purchased this from another r/mm user.  It has lubed alps dampened creams.  It is very smooth, and I re-lubed the space bar stabs so there is zero rattle to this.  The case is extremely clean.  I will ship with an ADP cable and an ADP to USB converter box that I purchased off of eBay so you can start using right away.  Works well with Mac and PC, and fully programmable.  Selling this because it's not my thing.  I thought I was going to harvest the alps and caps for another build, but I have a pile of boards I need work on so I'd rather just sell for now.~~ | ~~$105~~ (Sold - thank you to the buyer!)
 
-----  

Note: I have a few more vintage boards I will be working on in the coming days as well.  Additionally, these older WYSE boards also have vintage screw-in stabs (space bar only unfortunately) so those will be coming available too.  And of course, the left over plate mount stabs.  It's been really cool working on these old boards and digging up their ""buried treasures"" and history.


For international shipping, we would have to work out a price depending on where it would be shipping to.

Located in Japan, will ship worldwide. It's been a long time since I've posted or kept up with mm so please bear with me on prices and make an offer if you think something's unreasonable. Thanks!

##### Shipping options:

- $12 tracked airmail (1-2 week delivery time, package weight <1kg)
- $24 tracked airmail (1-2 week delivery time, package weight 1-2kg)
- Can use EMS for speed (<1 week delivery time), price starts at $20 for 500g
- For heavier packages like keyboards (over 2kg) please ask me for a quote. Oftentimes EMS is the best option for shipping out a single keyboard (arrives in a few days and costs around $40-50). Alternatively, surface mail can take a few months but is always cheap.

### NEC PC-8801 Blue Alps Keyboard

- Very clean 8801 with Blue Alps (grey switchplate). Old 15-pin connector.
- Haven't verified functionality but keys all feel great, opened to check switchplate and slider, feel 9/10, only some slight dust on the bottom of the switch, nothing in the top housing.
- Case and keycaps (katakana dye-sub pbt alphas, doubleshot abs alphas) are unyellowed
- Caps appear to be relatively unused without much shine. Original texture seems to be all there. 
- Original coil/cable in good condition and clean as well.
- Plate has some chipped spots. Gave it a wipe down. I have a plate in better condition that I could include as a spare if desired.
- I don't own an adapter but I could purchase one for you ($30) from a Japanese seller or check out deskthority for some DIY guides

Price: $250

___________________

### Switches

- If you need more or less switches than the quantity listed just PM and I might have extras.
- Add SKCM Lock switches for $1 each

##### SKCM Dampened White x100

- They feel fine for what they are but they're not my thing. Good for spare parts or matias substitute.

Price: $10 (0.1/switch)

##### Cherry MX Black x80

- Not vintage but still fairly smooth from use. Can provide closeups of stems if desired. Don't have cherries to compare them to but quite similar to stock gateron in terms of smoothness. 

Price: $20 ($0.25/sw)

##### ~~SKCM Salmon x78~~ SOLD

- 7/10 salmons, dusty, some scratchiness.
- Needs cleaning / dusting, lube recommended.

Price: $40 ($0.50/sw)

_________________________

### Apple AEK 2 M0312J 

- like new aek2 with JP caps. Case is remarkably clean and non-yellowed, caps and case are pretty much the same tone of Apple beige. 
- Switches feel clean for what they are (dampened whites)
- can build pro micro hasu adb adapter for $15 (required to use, board uses adb)
- includes adb cable

Price: $150

_________________________

### Apple M0116J

- Good condition Apple Keyboard with JP caps. Case and caps could use some cleaning.
- Switches are Alps Salmon but they're easily 9 or 10 / 10, they feel light and clean with no binding. 
- can build pro micro hasu adb adapter for $15 (required to use, board uses adb)
- Includes original box and adb cable. I can also include a spare outer case if needed.

Price: $150

### Toshiba J3100GL spare keyboard

A spare part for the Japan-exclusive version of the T3100 ""laptop"" computer, a bit different from the one I had last time as this one was marked for the GL variant. This is the last one of these that I have, haven't been able to find any more. These use Alps Common Mount Low Profile (SKFM/SKFN), but still have OG Alps doubleshots with lots of Hiragana sublegends (and some printed front legends as well!). The color scheme is a white text on very light grey, with slightly darker grey mods - like a lower contrast Oblivion/MoDo. 

- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/z3sAS3u
- [The KLE layout for the GT version.](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/8a06796d2c16c3ac42eb5387351cc586) I haven't drawn one up for this version yet.
- Alps SKFL, PCB Mount. PCB cloth cover missing. However, plastic cover + original Alps manufacturer sticker remains on the back.
- OEM profile Alps-made thick doubleshot keycaps with Hiragana sublegends. The legends are fairly normal compared to the one sold last time but this one has lots of nice, contrasting orange text on some of the utility keys. Compared to the other J3100 GL I had, this has slightly more wear but still overall good condition. Dropped the price to account for that though.

Price: $80

_________________________

### Keycaps

##### Apple AEK II JP Keycaps

- Apple Alps dye-subbed keycaps with JP sublegends, in extremely good condition. Spacebar is non-yellowed but has a bit of shine. Spacebar comparison to NOS: https://imgur.com/a/4sgFqzb
- Mexico-made with dark/bold black dyesub
- Includes stabilizers, clips, mounts.

Price: $120

##### Apple IIGS Keycaps

- Apple Alps dye-subbed keycaps, AEK profile but in the square-shaped IIGS shape. Identical to m0116 BUT number row is rotated 90-degrees so not recommended unless you have either a Planck-esque keyboard or a IIGS in need of caps

Price: $20

~~##### NEC PC8801 Keycaps, dye-sub alpha / ABS doubleshot mods~~ sold

- Alphas in great condition but the mods are yellowed. No stabilizers.
- katakana sublegend for alphas

Price: $30

##### ~~NEC PC8801 Keycaps, good condition doubleshots~~ sold

- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/J8HDiQn
- Caps in good condition, very slight yellowing on alphas, somewhat inconsistent but stronger on the numpad. Overall pretty good looking if planning on just using alphas. Numpad and some mods could use retrobright. 
- Medium-thick Alps doubleshot ABS keycaps with Hiragana sublegends, interesting non-standard mods with katakana legends. Convex space keys are singleshot with some front pad-printing. 
- Profile is very similar to OEM Profile, can be mixed with Taihao and the like.
- Includes stabilizers, clips, mounts
- Price: $80

##### ~~GMK Oblivion stuff from V2~~ SOLD

- ~~Hagoromo Alphas.~~ They're sealed but the packaging is bad so that jumble inside of the plastic wrap is how I received it. All the keys seem to be there though. $100.
- ~~Oblivion Vim kit (partial)~~ - selling the white HJKL keys + grey keys with White Vim logo. $10

Notes: This board came from the factory with some paint scuffs, I'll not say it's perfect but the damage isn't noticable from the top down/ when using/displaying the board, only when you pick it up look around etc. See pics

~~I got this thing and while it's a very nice board, it's not for me. I don't need a 75 percent, or knob or screen. It's built with chisto-lubed zeal stabs and the older tangerine switches (not the new translucent ones, these have black bottom and milky top) lubed with 3204 and filmed. I ran out of switches for the 3 on the right, those are lubed gateron glow switches. I used a 60% MKUltra foam for that area and added a bit of foam to supplement by the cluster of keys on the right, and a piece of foam from Michael's that I cut to fit under the PCB. JTK toxic is not included, but the case it came with and knob are.  **Trades only** See below for trade interests. If I don't find a trade I like in a few weeks maybe I'll sell it, I'll list it then. *Don't ask me to DM you if I decide to sell it, I won't remember.~~

~~PC Leaf60~~

[Pics](https://imgur.com/a/x6Dl4Cs)

~~This is a nice board, but I think ten or less is a nice number of 60% boards to own and this one lost survivor. It has a brass plate and hot swap PCB (I can't remember if that was an option or the standard). It's got silent inks and generic stabs that are christo-lubed and I think bandaided. I used this board at work (I don't type a ton, but some) for a few months, the plate has some discoloring as you can see in the pics (I think my poor lighting makes it look worse in the pic, but idk). There's also a small nick in the top left, it's not very noticeable, but it's there, see pics. **I was thinking $500 or trades**, if not a trade, and if for some reason you don't want the silent inks 450 (I don't have a switch puller so it's a pain to take them out...).~~

Massdrop inifity60

As pictured, includes black PBT DSA blanks. Has a cherry MX Blue on escape, and otherwise is Matias click. This was the first kit I ever built, and I really just don't care for the switches. Great starter board! I only took one pic, but I've listed it before, take a look through my post history for more pics.  **$120**

.

**Want**

I got this really beautiful set with a really nice numpad that I want to show off, and I don't have a keyboard with a numpad to put it on. I'd really like an HBCP or maybe a TXCP to show off handarbeit on. I also might be interested in a blue-grey QXP. Other than that  Otherwise I guess I might be open to trade for interesting TKLs or 60%s, feel free to DM me with reasonable inquiries."

Because of this, I will sell including the switches, or without the switches, at a discount. will still include the sorbathane in any case.

Hey guys, I have some items to sell

All prices include PayPal fees and shipping. Invoice only. As usual please comment before DM.

**1.** **Salvun comissioned artisans.**

I have some artisans that I commissioned Salvun with. I wanted them for myself but there are MOQs and all that jazz, so selling extras. In total 21 were made, 11 are b-stock (old CNC) and 10 are a-stock (new Haas CNC), machining is really high quality on both though. There are 8 of a-stock and 9 of b-stock remaining. MX stem, R1 (Esc row), Alu with anodizing and laser engraving, the design is an occult symbol of the MX stem.

**A-stock**, black box, perfect ano and engraving; **$48** **shipped** worldwide; 6 available

**B-stock**, yellow box, there are some ano blemishes here and there but mostly on the sides, engraving is not as clear as well, see the album for that; **$36** **shipped** worldwide; 9 available

Looking  only to trade the E6.5 for now. It's the polycarb version. It's built with black Gateron Inks, lubed with 205g0 on a poly half plate. It has  the white badge and will come with the box and everything it was shipped  with. I should note as well that this was built with GMK screw in stabs  which has the gasket touching the case as you'll see in the pictures.  Hasn't affected the case or the typing experience in anyway. Looking for  other boards (built or unbuilt) in this price range. Open to anything  as of now.

Hello,

I have for sale a GMK Triumph Alder set, and an U87 Realforce. 

 
I am asking $125 for the TA GMK - open to offers because of the missing key. Not sure what the market for a complete set is. So if someone has a good idea let me know.

I am asking $180 for the RF U87.


The Triumph Alder set has been my DD on my leopold, but there is no sign of any shining. No scratches or anything like that. The only issue is that I lost the ""Z"" key. I have one of the blank key caps on the z key, and it dosent bother me. Does not include the pokemon aluminum keycaps or the space bar- that is part of a different set. 


The Realforce is a 2nd hand keeb so I don't know the full history, but I have been using it as a DD at work for about a year. Nothing wrong with it, but the keys could use a little cleaning. This is my grail keyboard TBH, but I need money to invest right now. Comes with windowed caps locks, and insert? key. Also comes with OEM key puller. I am also throwing in a specialty-run orange ""realforce"" key from a massdrop RF 10-numpad drop from a few years back. I dont have any use for it without a topre keeb anymore.


If you have question or need more pictures please ask. I will not respond to PMs if you do not comment in the thread.

I usually am able to ship for $5 domestically. If international people are interested then I can check international shipping rates.

[BOW closeups](https://i.imgur.com/utICzDT.jpg)

Bunch of extra parts + icons extension since I found 40% keyboards/didn't want to deal with gmk pricing/sound for abs now that Kat is a thing.

Roselio housings are spares from making red roses switches, has original springs and stems are 39 red ink, 6 cherry clear stems and only other linears are retooled reds so ask for those at your own risk. Would recommend just using aliaz housings for the rest or going for some red inks. (Willing to lube/spring swap these for extra cash)


**Prices**

GMK WOB/BOW icons extension kit $120(Also willing to split for wob80 bow90 shipped)

Roselios housings+stems $30

All prices shipped to conus, willing to give discount for multiple things bought. Maybe fcfs maybe not really just depends on my laziness/how messages come in. 

As to trades I'm interested in pbt caps, switches of different sorts(frankens are fun) or 40s/65% boards but not expecting much there so send offers for anything at all(and I mean anything since that seems fun to open up to) it and worst case I just say no.

Currently selling my white doro67 built with 70g Red Holy Panda and lubed GMK stabs. The board has been used lightly and in excellent condition beside some minor scratch in the screw holes of the back plate which are really hard to see and you can't see them at all after assemble it. I also replaced the original daughterboard because it didn't work properly, so the board is good to use without any problems!

The price for it will be **~~380$ shipped CONUS~~**    **Sold for 360$. I**ncluding the original box and a cable\*\*,\*\* no international unfortunately."

Hello. I'm new to trading here so apologies if I'm doing it wrong. I'm also aware of my abysmal comment karma as a result of basically never posting or commenting, but hey I guess everybody's gotta start somewhere lol. I totally get any apprehension though.
 

Anyways, reason for selling: I won't have a board to throw these on for awhile thanks to the savage lineup of GBs this year already, so just looking to sell. 


Item | Description | Price (OBO)

GMK Wavez Base | Factory Sealed | SOLD
Wavez Novelties | Factory Sealed | SOLD

Can definitely knock a couple bucks off if bundling, or if you happen to be in the Phoenix metro area, could even do a local 


I'm gonna keep it simple. PayPal goods and services, and I pay the USPS Priority tracked shipping (CONUS only). Package ships same/next business day at the latest so typical delivery expectation should be within 3-4 days payment for most of the US.


Thanks guys for taking an interest. It's bedtime, so if I don't answer back to any PM's or questions immediately, I'll get back to you asap in the morning when I wake up.

Hey there!

Selling today my **Keycult No. 2 Rev. 1** that I won from the raffle last July as well as the **Rama x Keycult Brass** **artisan keycap**. I'm only willing to sell both items together. Really did not want to let go of this keyboard but I already find TKLs a bit too big for my taste after getting used to 60s and 65s. The keyboard is #138 out of the 150 that was built. The only flaw are minuscule dots that could barely be seen in the second last photo.

Specs of the keyboard are as follows:

\-  **Keycult No.2 Rev.1 Windows Key (A-stock)**

\- Switches: Gateron black inks spring-swapped with 55g spirit springs apart from the spacebar which still uses the original 70g ink spring.

\- Stabilizers: GMK screw-in

\- Setup utilizes a 7u space bar as evident in the photos.

I'll be shipping from the Philippines through DHL in its original box. Will be including the Keycult card as well as the allen wrenches that came with the keyboard.

~~Looking for $2,500 shipping included.~~ 

Update: ~~RESERVED~~ **SOLD!**

Hi mechmarket, need some money to fund some animal crossing adventures soon so I'm selling some keysets and switches I have laying around.

&#x200B;

**~~60 x Gateron Black Inks:~~**

~~These are V1, but I'm unsure if these have leaf issues or not as I bought them lubed with 205g0 already. Never got around to putting these on a board, but the legs have been clipped already. If need 10 more for a full 65% build, I'll throw in 10 more Gateron Yellows (new) that have been lubed with 205g0 as well for an additional 5 USD.~~

***~~Price: 75 USD Shipped.~~***

***~~Price with Gateron Yellows: 80 USD Shipped.~~***

&#x200B;

**GMK Modern Dolch Base Kit + Icons Kit + 6.25u Red Mint Spacebar:**

The base kit was only typed on for around a week so none to very little shine overall. The only keys that I noticed shine on in the base kit was the grey 6.25u spacebar and more so on the mint green enter key as these were used for longer.

For the icons kit, only the 6 keys that were placed on the white cardboard were used for around a week, so I have not noticed any shine on them. The mint icon esc key has been used as an accent key on my board for awhile, so it does have some shine on it.

The extra 6.25u red spacebar was not used at all, but I have no use for it so I will include it altogether.

***Price: 385 USD Shipped*** (shipped in bags as I do not have a box big enough anymore to include the tray sadly.)"

* There are small scratches on the brass plate since it is pvd, but obviously nothing will be seen with keycaps on.

**Asking $460 + shipping**

**~~Healios x 60~~**

I'm looking for a new home for my custom build based on the MF68 Magicforce 68 replacement PCB! This is a great PCB for folks who love the MIYA Pro/Magicforce 68 layout but want the flexibility of QMK firmware!

The case is comprised of a 1.6mm raw aluminum plate, 12mm brass standoffs, and several layers of 3mm frosted clear acrylic. Switches are milky top black bottom Gateron Yellows, all lubed with Tribosys 3204. To allow for easier servicing of plate-mounted stabs, all stabilized key locations have been outfitted with Mill-Max 0305 sockets, so there's no need to desolder if your stab wires need fixing or you want to refresh your application of lube! Just pull the switch, then slip the stabilizer out. Easy-peasy! :)

Authentic GMK/Cherry stabilizers are lubed and preinstalled for the spacebar and right Shift. You'll need to supply 3 sets of 2U plate-mount stabilizers for the remaining stabilized keys. (They were out of stock when I was wrapping up this build, and I moved onto another project before they became available again!)

There are three small and extremely light rubs in the frosted acrylic on the bottom of the case, which has caused these areas to appear shiny under direct light. I've circled them in the photo above! Obviously, these aren't visible from the top or sides of the board.

Board connects via Mini USB (cable not included). Any keycap set that supports a TKL board will work! No non-standard key sizes here ;)

I'd like to get **$110** \+ shipping for this build. Comment before PMing, please! Chat is disabled, so please PM directly. Thanks for looking!"

There's a tiny bump in the top left of the case due to one of the screws pushing in too hard with all the extra added dirt. I tried to photograph it but it's barely noticeable. That screw works fine now, as well as all the others.
* Few micro-scratches, notably on the bottom left of the top case. I tried to photograph but it doesn't even seem noticeable enough for photographs.

Bunch of extra parts + icons extension since I found 40% keyboards/didn't want to deal with gmk pricing/sound for abs now that Kat is a thing.

Roselio housings are spares from making red roses switches, has original springs and stems are 39 red ink, 6 cherry clear stems and only other linears are retooled reds so ask for those at your own risk. Would recommend just using aliaz housings for the rest or going for some red inks. (Willing to lube/spring swap these for extra cash)

Unholy pandas have clear springs so not much special there.

Roselios housings+stems $30

~~Unholy pandas $20~~ **sold for asking**

All prices shipped to conus, willing to give discount for multiple things bought. Maybe fcfs maybe not really just depends on my laziness/how messages come in. 

As to trades I'm interested in pbt caps, switches of different sorts(frankens are fun) or 40s/65% boards but not expecting much there so send offers for anything at all(and I mean anything since that seems fun to open up to) it and worst case I just say no.

**Norbaforce:** [Album](https://imgur.com/a/rPcy37r#gcjVJc7) I really enjoyed the top mount topre experience, but the front height of the board is too much for my wrists personally. Case is almost in perfect condition, only defects being a very thin white streak on the bottom right of the case, and some marks on the aluminum backplate and around the screw holes. **Looking for $315 shipped**

**Realforce:** [Album](https://imgur.com/a/T6zqZY7#1UeqJsi) The 10th Anniversary Edition. Has the grey-blue color scheme with a dark navy blue case. Has BKE ultralights and lights installed (see album for configuration). ***Does not include stock domes.*** Slider rails are lubed with mechlube 2 and the stabs have been greased to reduce rattle. The previous owner stripped a screw of its head and messed up the screw heads of 2 others. Got some replacements from McMaster and put them in, and while the screw head is a bit smaller, they still work fine. The missing screw does not affect keyfeel or operation at all. Will include 10 additional screws, as well as the included keycaps (ctrl-caps swap, red esc, blue wasd cluster) **Looking for $195 shipped**


~~**Fujitsu:** [Album](https://imgur.com/a/h98BrLn#je44eB7) Has the rare variant of 3rd gen fujitsu leaf spring, that being the clicky version. All in a Tandy 3000, which can easily be converted for use on modern systems. Cleaned the case, keycaps, plate, and the innards, though a lot of scratches and marks still remain on the case. Unsure if there's any binding. Only case I've found is the 'T' key, but pressing the key in the exact same position doesn't lead to any binding. Otherwise keyfeel is still fine, even for the well-used alpha block to which the keycaps have shine to them. All keys work except for F6 and maybe the system request key. **Looking for $110 shipped CONUS**~~ **SOLD**

~~**GMK Oblivion Cadet:** Used for less than an hour **45 shipped**~~ **SOLD**

~~**Alpacas:** Have 111x of them that are installed with white films and invyr stems. Completely stock otherwise. Also has 4 other unfilmed ones that are ""B-Stock"", meaning weird stems or alpacas that don't feel as smooth. **Looking for $135 shipped**~~ **SOLD**

~~**Silent Alpaca Stems:** 115x count. Unsure if these stick upon being lubed (if anyone can confirm if gateron silents stick when freshly lubed that would be nice). The dampening material on these is not integrated to the stem, but rather dampening material stuck to the sides of the stem. **Looking for $20 shipped**~~ **SOLD**

**All prices are OBO. Not taking bids.**

**Do not send me chats. I won't respond.**

* TGR 910RE + 2 Hannah 910 PCBs + 2 Hannah Plates - $1850

Just not getting enough love for the moment. Figured someone else might like it, so here it is. 

Last chance for this one. 

Built by /u/LightningXI, has lubed vintage MX Blacks with 58.5g springs, they were aftermarket purchases so I'm not 100% sure on the lube used but they feel perfect. No scuffs on the board itself, handled with care so except for the stray markings on the polycarb because thats the nature of polycarb. [Only slight markings on the weight, nothing crazy they look very shallow.](https://i.imgur.com/DCSSQXp.jpg) 

Only comes with the board + the extra pcbs/plates, no keycaps. 

* GMK Modern Dolch - $375? idk, super OBO

Used for about a week, cemented that I don't like how abs feels or how it gets shiny kinda fast especially with how much i use my WASD and such.

But with that said, the quality is fine. Some texture is slowly whittling away particularly on WASD and the blue 7u spacebar, but otherwise still very pristine.  

Contains all kits, base/spacebars/icon mods, shipped in bag unless requested otherwise.

* Sticky Grape Mulder - $55
* ADAMSKI ""Starcluster"" Gamer - $220
* Tokkipee Andes Gamer - $30
* Tokkipee ??? Gamer - $30

[These are the Tokkipee gamers, sorry for bad lighting in timestamp, can't do much about required lights in apartment complex.](https://i.imgur.com/5QxCzNn.png) They come with Esc, WASD and an Fn. 

ADAMSKI Gamer doesn't have a name, but they look *very* similar to Bro's Starcluster/Starclusterfuck colorway so that's what I'm calling them. Comes with Esc, WASD and two Fns. These are Cherry profile, but they sit high on switches, its not an OEM profile because the angles match, they probably were prototypes of some sort. 

Only trades I'm looking for, that can give value towards buying too:

* OG / CRP / IMSTO Dyesubs
* OG POMs / Cherry Jelly POMs 

Shipping out sometime this week."
