***Have:***

~~Ewhite Key65 with a Teal Key Logo (does not include caps or artisans)~~

Middle section is Teal as well. The back has a teal weight with a white key logo.

I personally see no imperfections with the board except for a tiny dot where the screw hole (top right) is which was already there when I received the board from GB. (in the timestamp). Some minor normal scratches on the alum plate from removing and installing switches.

&#x200B;

Hotswap PCB. The tab hotswap socket was a little finicky at times so I replaced it with the top right kailh hotswap socket as that cannot be used anyway due to the key logo, so it works great now.

&#x200B;

Comes equipped with 62g Tangerines that have been lubed w/ 205g0 and tx clear filmed. The stabs are C3 Cream Stabs w/ black wire, lubed w/ 205g0 (can relube these if needed, and will come with the rest of the C3 Cream Stabs that weren't used).

Has all white LEDs as well that are working.

Will come with the OG Fox Labs box.

I was the only owner of this board so I really took great care of it. I believe it matches great with GMK Finer Things with the teal and key logo :)

I believe this is one of the few ewhite key65s with a teal key logo I've ever seen besides the one my sister has.

&#x200B;

*~~Price: 725 USD Shipped w/ switches included.~~*

*~~No switches: 650 USD Shipped.~~*

*Sold for 650 w/o switches*

Willing to negotiate a bit if needed.

Priority goes to any of the birch latrialums, heliu, and liu latrialums.

Willing to possibly n+1 for arrows or add paypal to even the trade if needed.

I'm also interested in other lats (no xmas) and keybys (rudolf, islander, pink noel, pan-pan, etc).

Willing to also buy certain latrialums/keybys with just paypal as well.

Have several items for sale, all prices include shipping, CONUS only.

Keyboards - note: stabilizers are not included and will be removed

~~1. Rama Thermal Kuro HHKB - 550usd obo 
Used, case in excellent condition and includes 3 PCBs (hotswap mounted once, used solder 7 key has LED issue, new WT-60A) and 2 Plates (beam plate has some scratches from use but not noticeable once keycaps on, custom POM plate from Ponoko that has been tested to fit Gateron Ink switches properly). Also includes original accessories.~~

2. Tofu60 Granite Gray -  180usd
Like new, with the exception of brass plate which has minor scratches from removing switches once - DZ60RGB v2 Hot Swap PCB, DZ60 RGB Case Foam, DZ60 RGB PCB Foam, DZ60 brass plate

3. Think6.5 v1 Light Green - 425usd obo
Used, excellent condition, plate has a few very minor marks from switches being removed. Not visible once switches in place. Hotswap PCB and comes with carrying case and extra 2u PC badge. Please note, I purchased unused but it did not come with M2 screws for the bottom so I had to purchase my own. As such, they do not match the gold colored M3 screws on the corners. Obviously not visible when in use, but worth noting.

2. GMK Bleached (Base) - 210usd - purchased used from r/mm, never mounted myself and appears like new

To make it easier for buyers:

\- Shipping prices in eu generally are 4-15 euros (depends on various reasons (if it untracked or tracked), how big is the package)

\- Shipping prices to usa/canada generally are 20-70 (depends on various reasons, mostly size and weight affects price exponentially)

\- PRICE<60 € is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € for tracked;

\- 60=<PRICE<100 € (or just generally heavy) is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € - 3.5 € for tracked (unless listed otherwise)

\- PRICE=>100+ € items is sent via tracked/registered mail (unless asked otherwise);

\- Shipping to UK due to new regulations increase by roughly 3e (just add 3e to current EU price), but priority is EU > UK > Other.

In the future I may offer lube or soldering services, but I still need 2 trades to go :)

The listed items is easily reachable and I can photoshoot them every two weeks. However I have more items (switches, pcbs, keyboard cases), which is too much work to photoshoot (it is really annoying to do that every two weeks), but you can ask me more options and I may list more items.

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-60 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct. You can write to me with a similar price I offer, however if this is not my offering price, there is much lower chance I will sell item right away or at all. Especially if price is fixed
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay, but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, ask :)*"

Hi everyone,

Have an NK65 Milkshake Edition bought from another user that ended up having stripped screws on the pcb. The silk yellow switches that come with it are lubed with krytox 205g0, however I only have 66 of them and 41/66 are filmed. The stabs are lubed with krytox 205g0 and band aid modded. Note: There are 68 switches needed, will provide free fill in alternatives in PM

Currently, the hyperglide blacks are installed with durrock stabs so the timestamp pictures wont match. Used for a combined month. Comes with everything, case, cable, and spare keycaps.

Looking for $240 + shipping

&#x200B;

Retooled Cherry Hyperglide Blacks (69): Used for less than 2 weeks. Lubed with krytox 205g0 and filmed with Deskey films - $85 shipped

If the Hyperglide Blacks and Milkshake are bought together - $315 shipped

&#x200B;

Black Prebuilt KBD75 V1 - Prebuilt by kbd has gmk screw in stabs, brass plate, , case foam, and stock kalih creams (soldered), used for a month - $160 shipped

*asking ~~$190 $185 $180~~ $175 + shipping*

[iPhone Sound Test (EPBT Keycaps)](https://vocaroo.com/1jK58sYM0rEC)

The Cherry Blossom color was a custom order, which raised the price of the case by $40 (from 60 to 100).

Prime_E Rev 2 Solder PCB, no RGB 

Switches are lubed with 205g0 and filmed with Black Deskey Films. Stock 62g springs Lubed with Krytox 205g2 + 105. Stabs are Durock v1 smoke gray with black coated wires.

One of the layers on the right side towards the back of the board was snapped, you can see it in the album for this board.

It can be fixed with acrylic cement. However, the damage is not visible during normal use and does not affect the structural integrity of the board. It is still sturdy as there are two screws that go through the piece that snapped off.

Kit contains five plates, unused plate foam and unused Plain60-C PCB.

Plates:

\- Brass universal (from original GB)

\- Teal alu fixed 7u ansi (from original GB)

\- POM fixed 7u ansi (from original GB) - this plate is kinda defective due to manufacturers mistake, there are uneven distances between switches. So it's basically free and can be used only for experiments.

\- FR4 fixed 7u ansi (custom made)

\- Forged carbon fiber fixed 7u ansi (custom made). I've never built the board with this plate so I can't guarantee if it works or not.

There are some scratches in usb cutout (shown on photos). They are invisible when built.

I can also add switches to keyboard kit.

Getting ready for a big move so I've decided to sell a few items I've been holding onto for a while. I tried to be as thorough as possible in my photos so please take the time to look through each of the albums if you have concerns or just want to see more pictures of the product.

# Keyboards

|[Black SP-111 Kit](https://imgur.com/a/FOEoKEl)|Love this board but found that it was slightly too large for my usual working environment. It was my daily driver for about a month before I disassembled everything and kept it in storage. This comes with all original packaging along with a brass plate and 2x sets of PCBs. One PCB set has been used and desoldered once however I left the LEDs in case this was something someone else wanted to use. The other is completely brand new. There's a slight scuff on the upper right hand corner which I've indicated in the photo album. Otherwise this is an A-stock board that's in pristine condition.|**~~$700~~** ***SOLD***|

# Keycaps

|[GMK Muted R1 Base Set + Purple/Cyan Accent Kit](https://imgur.com/a/bPOMDg6)|**GMK TRAY IS NOT INCLUDED.** Previously owned set but in very good condition. There's no shine on the keycaps despite not being the first owner, I used these very sparingly. I will be shipping these keycaps in individual bags. If there's a preference I can separate out the keycaps as requested but please let me know beforehand if this is something you'd like. Not looking to split these sets.|**~~$200~~** ***SOLD***|

|[GMK Froyo R1 Base Set + Spacebar Kit](https://imgur.com/a/GeFXgsD)|I'm the original owner and these were very lightly used. No shine on the keycaps and the spacebar kit is completely unopened. Not looking to split these sets.|**~~$200~~** ***SOLD***|
|[ePBT Kuro Shiro Base Set + Japanese Mods + Icon Mods + Spacebar Kit](https://imgur.com/a/qqPLDJ0)|Not looking to split this set. I'm the original owner of these keycaps and they were very lightly used. These keycaps were mounted once to test different configurations and have since gone unused. Will ship with all original packaging and bags used for the keycaps.|**$275**|
|[BSP Classic Beige Red](https://imgur.com/a/bK7pTAC)|**GMK TRAY IS NOT INCLUDED.** I'm the original owner of this set and this was purchased directly from Originative Co. These were never mounted and are completely brand new. I will be shipping these keycaps in individual bags. This set only covers a tenkeyless and winkeyless layout. Please note that this set will NOT include spacebars.|**~~$150~~** ***SOLD***|

[Additional Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/A56M8Uo)

I have a Cherry B Sakabato 87, Founders Edition (meaning its chrome plated and serialized). Extras include the extra Cloud brass weight for the early run, an extra daughterboard, and StupidFish case + plate foam. The pcb is currently soldered with L/F Alpacas, however I believe they are releasing a hotswap, via compatible pcb soon. The case is in good condition, with a slight knick right above the arrow keys, along with visible dust specks that come with having a chrome keyboard. These are pictured in the timestamp. Additional pics may be requested for serious buyers

Also letting go of GMK Botanical Base I picked up during the extras a while back. No shine, great condition, open box.

Prices: Sakabato 87 - $700 + shipping

~~Gmk Botanical Base - $330 + shipping~~ sold to u/SandyTurtle

Still looking for latin barred F/J keys for my GMK Umbra set. Per pic 2, the set came with 2 sets of blank F/J keys. If anyone using the hiragana kit wants to part with their latin barred F/J keys, I'd pay a reasonable amount and be super grateful.

If I can't find homing keys, I'll let the set go for $200 + shipping. Alphas unused, modifiers used for \~1 week (no shine).

Hey everyone! Sad to let this one go but I have to trim down the collection for some funds. Selling a Black WKL KBD8X MKII with the following extras:

* Build 1: [Sound Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUaKlCGpubA)
   * Plate: PC Full
   * Switches: Box Jades on Alphas, Box Navies elsewhere
   * Film: None
   * Stabilizers: GMK Screw-In with CK Wires (XHT-BDZ)
* Build 2: [Sound Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvdtHC-iBlI)
   * Plate: Brass Full
   * Switches: Cherry Silent Reds (16mm 67g TX Springs, NO LUBE ON SWITCH). 80g spring on modifiers. 105g0 on springs.
   * Film: Deskeys
   * Stabilizers: Zeal (XHT-BDZ), GMK Screw-in on spacebar.
* Extra POM Plate
* Extra FR4 Plate
* Extra Aluminum Plate
* 20A and 60A O Rings
* CannonKeys Large Carrying Case + Extra Microfiber Cloth
* Stock case foam

The PCB on the clicky build has been through quite a few rebuilds so there are a couple jumped/lifted pads. It's completely functional as is but since it's in poor condition I'm not factoring in the cost of that PCB to the price. The silent build is the first build on the second PCB, that one's in good condition. There are no external flaws on the case as far as I can see. Some internal marks, but they're minor and not visible when assembled. See album for more pictures!

I can also bundle in my set of CRP Peacock R3 to the board for an additional $140 (bought it for $220, it's still in great condition).

Asking for:

**~~Board + extras: $420 SHIPPED CONUS ONLY~~**

**~~Board + extras + CRP: $560 SHIPPED CONUS ONLY~~**

Not looking to split plates and stuff, CRP is only bundled with everything else.

Hi folks, today I have an E-white S7 Elephant R2 for sale. One PCB, white alu plate, built with lubed and filmed mauves, 70g TX spring swapped. Easily the best 205g0 application i've ever done, these are glass smooth and sound amazing. Lubed and filmed durock v1 stabs.

***There are issues with the finish.*** I kept the board in a No.23 bag, and the included microfiber cloth leeched ink onto the e-white finish on the right side of the case. Not terrible, but it's there. I've lived with it, but you may consider cerakote for a perfect finish. **$1200 + shipping (heavy boi) OBO.**

**EDIT:** Holy f\*\*\* RIP my inbox. Ideally, I'd like to address this in a FCFS manner, but want to prioritize someone who hasn't built their own board yet or have yet to try a premium board. I'm losing money on this regardless, but want to make sure it finds the right home.

**EDIT #2:** *wheeeuw* This may take me a bit of time to process. Thank you for understanding

**EDIT #3:** To keep expectations in check and because I am unable to answer all PMs: I believe I've found a compelling buyer. I am currently confirming things with him.

**EDIT #4:** I have selected a buyer and confirmed his story. This user is keebless (laptop kb currently) and this will be his first premium board after waiting for many months and slowly securing parts. Apologies for not being able to answer everyone. It was a massive response that I wasn't expecting. Thank you everyone for your interest, kind words, and good luck to all of you in your searches.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\----------------------------------------

**The Intro:** Alright, /r/mechmarket. Get ready to laugh, cry, shake your head, potentially downvote, and who knows what else.

\----------------------------------------

**The Pitch:** Have you always wanted a Satisfaction75 but missed out on the GB or didn't want to pick one up for after market? Well, this here's the board for you. Think of this Sat75 like a rescue animal: in need of help and a little bit of TLC. At a fraction of the price, this fixer-upper kit could be yours, and rehabilitated back to proper health if you put a little bit of effort in.

\----------------------------------------

**The Story:** This here is a Satisfaction75 R1 that was originally bought in 2020 and poorly shipped with close to no protection. The original seller and I worked things out long ago, where they walked away with a decent fraction of the price and I got a cheaper Sat75 with knicks on the top case and a broken PCB. Moving forward in the story, after several months later, I managed to buy a PCB and built the damn thing. It had some blemishes on the top which weren't too visible, and overall [the board worked and felt great, and looked pretty decent](https://imgur.com/K3gUpEo). I received some quotes for cerakoting at around $80-120, but I didn't have the time or energy. I wasn't too bothered by the knicks, especially as most of them were hidden by keycaps or facing away from me. So, my grey Sat75 with knicks, Zilent V2 62g lubed with 3203, and GMK stabs (before the retools) was born. The hard amount that I actually put into the board as far as total costs was roughly $470 after *everything* that the board had gone through.

Now fast forward to the year 2021. COVID had taken its toll, scientists had found our tickets back to freedom, and humanity's hearts were gleaming once more (with the exception of the Worldwide League of Karens). I wish I had a better story to tell, but I'll drop the mic: I fried the PCB from the static generated by a pair of artificial-fabric socks from Adidas on a day when the humidity dropped below 10%. You'd think you could trust the socks you buy at Costco to lead you to the Gates of Runner's-Valhalla without frying your keyboard along the way, but no, you can't.

So now, I have this Sat75, still built, with a fried PCB, and knicks on the top case.

&#x200B;

**This board will need:**

\- a new PCB (which can be picked up as extras from CK or from someone when R2 ships, est. Q3 2021)

\- the ability to desolder the current dead PCB, and resolder the switches back to it.

\- if inclined, a new coat of paint, but ONLY on the top case half. The bottom case half is pristine, and the brass weight is maybe 1-2% patina'ed.

&#x200B;

I am not here to make money on this board. I'd like to sell what's worth and left over of this board to someone who would be interested in having fun with this project board. I could do it all myself, then resell it at a list price or more, but truthfully, I'm just not that interested in the Sat75 as a whole anymore. It served me well for the year that I had the board, I loved typing on it and listening in, and the rotary knob + oled was incredibly useful.

The aluminum, brass plate, brass weight, Zilents, GMK stabs, etc. all still have some value left in them, but this value is definitely dependent on what you can make out of it with its current state.

&#x200B;

~~Rather than gather dust any longer, it can be yours for $240 + shipping (or OBO).~~ **Sold for asking**

If you get a new PCB and cerakote it, then it would still come out as cheaper than what you'd pay for the retail kit + taxes + shipping from CannonKeys.

That's all. Thanks

Hey y’all looking to trade this board for any wkl boards. Especially looking for KFE CE, Key65 and other 65%. If someone’s interested in trading without keycaps that’s fine too. Local to Dallas. Please comment before PM, Thanks! 

Polycarbonate E8.5 - E-White badge and back triangle weight, comes with extra e-white aluminum plate. Currently built with lubed and filmed dogikon switches and lubed cream c3 stabilizers with a polycarbonate plate on a solder PCB. Comes with box and all original accessories.

GMK Minimal - R1 Base kit + add on kit (see pictures for all the caps included) No noticeable shine"

Selling my NK 65 Aluminum , bought it to try it out but decided not to keep it so it was rarely used. Purchased the GMK Ursa from another user recently but decided not to keep the set.

NK 65 was O-ring modded but I can remove the o rings on the plate and case mounts.

To make it easier for buyers:

\- Shipping prices in eu generally are 4-15 euros (depends on various reasons (if it untracked or tracked), how big is the package)

\- Shipping prices to usa/canada generally are 20-70 (depends on various reasons, mostly size and weight affects price exponentially)

\- PRICE<60 € is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € for tracked;

\- 60=<PRICE<100 € (or just generally heavy) is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € - 3.5 € for tracked (unless listed otherwise)

\- PRICE=>100+ € items is sent via tracked/registered mail (unless asked otherwise);

\- Shipping to UK due to new regulations increase by roughly 3e (just add 3e to current EU price), but priority is EU > UK > Other.

In the future I may offer lube or soldering services, but I still need 2 trades to go :)

The listed items is easily reachable and I can photoshoot them every two weeks. However I have more items (switches, pcbs, keyboard cases), which is too much work to photoshoot (it is really annoying to do that every two weeks), but you can ask me more options and I may list more items.

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-60 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct. You can write to me with a similar price I offer, however if this is not my offering price, there is much lower chance I will sell item right away or at all. Especially if price is fixed
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay, but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, ask :)*"

Durock Stabilizers, tuned with 205g0 too. Fully operational, comes with the case, serial number, and the sticker. Used for a month or so until I rotated to a different keyboard. Hope it can go to a good home!|$160|SOLD|
|TOFU 60 Bottom-Sanded Silver Build|I tried sanding the bottom of the case, but got lazy. It's reflective but not mirror finish. I'm also too lazy to desolder the brown switches. They WERE Milky Gateron Yellows but I switched the stems for browns from my girlfriend's GMMK Ice Edition so she could have linear switches. So I guess they're... chocolate milk now?? Comes with aluminum plate and cherry stabilizers. They are tuned, and clipped. It sounds pretty thocky, which is nice.|$120|Available|

|NovelKeys\_ White on Black Double Shot PBT Cherry Keycaps|Full kit, used for a week until I got GMK WoB. There may be indents where the keycap puller was used to pull them out, but during daily use they are not noticeable.|$60|SOLD|
|DZ60RGB V2 Hotswap|Used, but in working order. 64 layout, where the bottom right corner is replaced with arrow keys. All LEDs are intact, and all components function nominally. Has stabilizers that are personally lubed with dielectric grease.|$40|SOLD|

I went to buy half a keyboard, and finish the other half at a later date. I bought the items listed in the title, a hot-swappable PCB, keycaps, stabilizers, and a cable.

The items were bought from KBDfans, and I didn't realize until later just how much I was paying for shipping, duties, etc. I didn't even realize it was in USD until after. That drove the price up way too much from what I was expecting to pay. I hate this, I'm fine enough with my razer keyboard. I just wanna get rid of it at this point.  I will show the items brand new in the shop here 

[https://kbdfans.com/products/kbdfans-kbd6x-hot-swap-pcb?\_pos=2&\_sid=a712ca774&\_ss=r](https://kbdfans.com/products/kbdfans-kbd6x-hot-swap-pcb?_pos=2&_sid=a712ca774&_ss=r) here is the PCB I have

[https://kbdfans.com/collections/usb-cable/products/mechanical-keyboard-usb-c-cable?variant=30685280075915](https://kbdfans.com/collections/usb-cable/products/mechanical-keyboard-usb-c-cable?variant=30685280075915) USB cable (light gray)

I paid 112$, it's now at 108$ Cad, and I had 27$ shipping, plus 35$ duties. So now to get it, it would cost approximately 170$ Cad. It has not been touched since, I'm not sure how much to mark it down, so I'll say 170$CAD OBO? I have all the original packaging and can make sure it's well protected when it ships

Here are the images I took of the actual items in my possession [https://imgur.com/gallery/eTkCiPG](https://imgur.com/gallery/eTkCiPG)

Or alternatively, if there's anyone selling the rest of the keyboard parts that I need that are in Canada, I'm interested. I just want this whole thing dealt with, whether I get the keyboard built or sell it off.

If anyone is wondering what my original setup was gonna be finished with, this was the other half that I didn't get to purchase

[iPhone Sound Test (EPBT Keycaps)](https://vocaroo.com/1jK58sYM0rEC)

The Cherry Blossom color was a custom order, which raised the price of the case by $40 (from 60 to 100).

Switches are lubed with 205g0 and filmed with Black Deskey Films. Stock 62g springs Lubed with Krytox 205g2 + 105. Stabs are Durock v1 smoke gray with black coated wires.

One of the layers on the right side towards the back of the board was snapped, you can see it in the album for this board.

It can be fixed with acrylic cement. However, the damage does not affect the build quality of the board. It is still sturdy as there are two screws that go through the piece that snapped off.

The Olivia++ dark was purchased from another user from MM and arrived yesterday. The previous owner said he used it lightly for about 1 month. I made a bad impulse purchase and realized I preferred WOB on my voice instead. Never mounted on my end.  Can't justify keeping this so looking to trade this for GMK Ursa. Willing to add a bit for a sealed/bnib set.

I am looking to sell my Duck Octagon V3

Hey folks,


Couple of things up for swap today.


**GMK Olivia++**

I have the base kit and the spacebar kit. Bought kits for myself and my SO, and it turns out she wants GMK Finer Things now for her e-white Rekt. Looking for minimally a base kit but I'd love to have the base kit and the spacebar kit. Looking for a 1-1 swap. The kit is opened and has been used but it's seen very minimal use and shouldn't have anything other than insignificant shine. 


**Switch Couture Alice Bundle**

This is a frosted SC Alice with the case feet, the Adelais PCB in black, and a hotswap USB-C PCB from Sneakbox. I never opened the Adelais PCB but I built the board to try Alice and now have a couple of high end Alice boards, so it's served its purpose for me. 

For this, I'm just looking to recoup my cost, so I'm asking for my cost for the board, which was **287.47**. I'll cover shipping and PP fee."

Hello friends. Looking to offload a few things I no longer use much. Heres what I got:

TIMESTAMP: [https://imgur.com/a/hTcYf7M](https://imgur.com/a/hTcYf7M)

1. White ""Stormtrooper"" HoneyBoard 60: I got this board about 4 or 5 months ago. Board is built with a DZ60 PCB and is Gasket mounted onto the plate. Switches are BSUN Holy Pandas Lubed. This board would be perfect for someone who is into gaming and wants to try the HHKB Layout. Satisfying clicks in a really well made board.

PRICE: $250 + $10 shipping

2. GMK Peaches N Cream Base Kit. This will ship in bags. (there are about 2 more than what is shown ) These have little to no shine and have been used off an on for a few months in my keyboard rotation. Super cute set I just dont have a board for them anymore!

# Shipping

Shipping is not included in asking prices.

I will not undervalue items that I ship internationally.

## Condition

|Rating|Details|
|:-|:-|
|1|New / Unused (Keycaps come in bags)|
|.95|Like new / Used for a few minutes for testing purposes|
|.8|Very good / Light signs of use and/or minor imperfections|
|.6|Full working condition. But something's not ideal. See listing for details.|

I have bad luck with dust in my photos sometimes. Please ask if you see any imperfections on items that I don't mention. Most of the time it's just dust and/or fingerprints.

## Prices

Prices are listed in GBP but I'll also accept EUR or USD.

Prices may seem high to international buyers. International shipping, import, handling, and PayPal fees add up quickly. I've included the amounts I paid including shipping and fees for transparency. If I'm asking a few pounds more than what I paid then I'm not making profit, I'm just selling it for what I paid including PayPal fees.

Iron165 and GMK DMG prices are unusually high (for my sales). These will be hard for me to let go of. Their prices will drop by 5% every 2 days or so if they don't sell.

# Updates

* 24-05-2021 00:04 GMT+1 All but one invoice that could be sent by 7pm local time this evening was sent. I will send invoices to the next people in line for each item if/when buyers back out. Sold and pending items above are up-to-date at this time. Sorry to anyone that I failed to get back to. I'll sort entries and send invoices again once per night as they continue to roll in.
* 24-05-2021 23:38 GMT+1 All invoices were sent and 2 buyers backed out. Invoices were sent to the next buyers and buyers that entered since my last update. There are currently 4 pending sales and 2 of those 4 told me in advance that they wouldn't pay until tomorrow. The sold and pending marks above may be slightly out of date in the tables above and the items in the form at this time.
* 25-05-2021 18:14 GMT+1 Everything that has been sold so far has been shipped or scheduled to be collected. I'll reach out to everyone individually with tracking numbers later tonight or tomorrow. There are still 2 pending sales and one buyer backed out. I'll send invoices to new entries and folks who are next in line for the backed out items later tonight.
* 26-05-2021 00:12 GMT+1 DMG, Novatouch, Noxary 268.2, and Iron165 have been sold. Sorry to those waiting and hoping that those pending sales would fall through. I told several people that I would reach out to them afterwards, but I won't have time to do that before I go to sleep tonight.
* 27-05-2021 01:35 GMT+1 I packed and booked the second wave of sales for collection tomorrow. I also updated the form and listing above."

Hello, back with another post! Just letting go of some stuff to fund my CRP R4 order. I normally would strike through product descriptions, but I will leave them up to help guide those who are looking to purchase any of the items listed below. 

Highly prefer shipping to USA addresses at the moment. All prices include USPS Priority Mail shipping costs.

**If you are local to 94706, I am fine doing local pickup/meetup and will lower price to reflect it.**

Item|Details|Price|Available
:--|:--|:--|:--
[Freyr TKL](https://i.imgur.com/41RVtZy.jpg) | black WK with red weight and alu plate. includes two Mechlovin infinity87 PCBs, one cleanly desoldered with an FR-301 and the other completely brand new. No external flaws I could find. Very solid TKL esp to start out with, but I have two nicer ones pending and there's no reason for me to keep this one. Switches and stabs not included as I did list the board built previously but no one was interested. Not splitting the board and PCBs unless I get two different people asking for each item.  **Price is now lower than what I paid for everything at retail!** I'll even give a further discount if you buy before the end of 5/22/2021. | ~~$370 shipped~~ | **SOLD FOR ASKING PRICE VIA DISCORD**


**I AM ALSO ACCEPTING TRADE OFFERS THAT INCLUDE GMK DARLING'S EXTENSION AND/OR SPACEBARS KIT** No, seriously. I'm willing to trade a whole board for both of these kits together.

Priority for responding to offers will be as follows:

 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing all items for asking price

Outside of the listed conditions, I'll check based on when you comment **and** PM. The PM is absolutely necessary for the sale of these items. Please understand that if you as a buyer and I agree on a price and you back out of the purchase right after I send the invoice, I will refuse to sell anything to you in the future (yes, that includes if you offer me something like $300 on something that I'm selling for much less). 

 **Do not use the chat function**, I honestly don't know how you are taken to the chat function when the bot's verification post gives you a link to PM sellers. I will ignore you and you won't be in consideration for anything until you send me a PM. I will also ignore you if you do not comment before sending a PM.

If I don't respond, it's likely because I'm just busy doing other things. I will get to all messages accompanying comments in a timely manner. Thank you for your time."

Hey mechmarket!

Making a post today to try and sell of some of my parts for some builds that are not going to happen anymore. The GMK caps are still sealed. The Jelly Keys are also new and never mounted. Right now, I am only looking to sell the Born of Forest caps as a bundle. If I have a buyer for each I may be able to split. Each artisan will ship in it's original wooden box with unique dogtag. The Godspeed Monochrome deskpad was used for a few minutes and then put back into storage. Bundles of multiple items will be given preference and small discount. If you are at all local to the northern Chicago suburbs, I'd be open for pickup. Feel free to message me with any questions you may have :)

Hi everyone,

~~I'd like to offer my GMK Darling set for a GMK Taro set. The set has been lightly used for 2 1/2 months. If you have r2 than + accent kit.~~

~~I'm primarily looking for trades within the EU, since this is the only keycap set I own and I don't want to spend too much time without any, since I plan to use my mechanical keyboard in the office soon (looks like I can go back there soon).I'm still open for trade from anywhere else, but we would need to find a solution: e.g., you send out your set first and then I'm sending out mine immediately after it arrives at the responsible postal service in Germany. Or maybe you can think of another solution.~~

~~I'm open to other GMK sets, but not looking for anything else in particular. Needs to pair well with a white TKL board.~~

Stay healthy and best regards,

Edit: Trade confirmed."

* **~~Support QMK~~**
* ~~Has a Elite-C controller on the left pcb, and Pro-Micro controller on the right pcb. Controllers are socketed~~
* ~~Comes with TRRS cable to connect the 2 halfs.~~
* ~~Note: On the left half, I did a bridge between 2 RGB LEDs (see~~ [~~here~~](https://imgur.com/gallery/zh1a0E5)~~). I think there is an open circuit on the pcb preventing signals between these LEDs. The bridge resolves the issue and allows all the LEDs to work correctly.~~
* **~~Does not come with cable to computer.~~** ~~You will need to provide your own usb-c cable.~~
* **~~Does not come with keycaps.~~**

**~~$95 shipped~~**

~~If you want, I can de-solder the brown switches and make this into a kit. You only need to solder your switches (and/or rotary encoders) and assemble. Everything else is already soldered for you. The cost will be the same.~~

# Zeta 40% ortho wireless keyboard kit

* PCB is black color. Support soldering of MX switches or Kailh Low Profile Choc switches
* Purchased it from southpawdesign: [https://southpawdesign.net/products/zeta-ergonomic-wireless-keyboard?variant=9480074133564](https://southpawdesign.net/products/zeta-ergonomic-wireless-keyboard?variant=9480074133564)
* It has been soldered once with choc switches, but I did a clean desoldering job (see [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/waTLIlJ)) in removing the switches.
* Tested and verified pads on the pcb activates key presses.
* It comes with everything I got from the kit. You will receive a partially assembled board  with a switch plate, stand-offs, screws, rubber feet, a bottom protector plate, and a pre-programmed micro-USB receiver.
* I will provide some additional rubber feet in case you don't like the locations I install them currently on the bottom plate.
* I kept the diodes soldered since there is no point in removing them. You would have to install them back anyway. Note that the diodes are installed on the top side of the pcb. It does not interfere with switches, switch plates or anything. Just a FYI for you. I did it that way because I was going for a very low-profile build with choc switches (i.e. no switch plate and no bottom plate)
* Also the controller on the pcb has a coating of Silicone Modified Conformal Coating to protect it from accidental water spills and other accidents. No such accidents occurred, but I wanted to protect it since I did an exposed pcb build.
* I wrapped the receiver unit in electrostatic tape to protect it. You can remove the tape if desired.
* You only need to solder your switches and assemble. Everything else is already soldered for you.
* **Support QMK**
* **Does not come with switches or keycaps.**

* ~~Comes with Kailh Speed Gold Switches (switches are stock; not lubed or filmed)~~
* ~~-- I also have other stock switches if you want to replace or add. I have Gateron Black, Gateron Red, Gateron Brown, and Kailh Speed Silver Switches~~
* ~~Comes with the following content and hardware that came with the Planck EZ keyboard~~
* ~~-- Tai-Hao Keycaps (black color, support shine-thru for backlight). Uniform OEM Row 3 profile.~~
* ~~-- USB Type-C Cable (70cm) - (black color)~~
* ~~-- Dongle to change usb-c to usb-a (for computers without usb-c ports) - (black color)~~
* ~~-- Tool to pull switches and pull keycaps~~
* **~~Support QMK~~**~~, but is is easier to use ZSA's software for configuring keymap and flashing hardware.~~
* ~~-- You use ZSA Oryx Configurator to configure keymap and build firmware file. Then use ZSA Wally utility to flash the keyboard with firmware file.~~
* ~~Note that I cut thru the back side's sticker (see~~ [~~here~~](https://imgur.com/gallery/vYom3Nu)~~) to get to the screw underneath to open case. I wanted to open the case to insert a pcb foam piece, but sadly the case design did not allow this. No damage to the case, just the sticker.~~
* ~~I installed some bigger rubber bump-ons to elevate the the back-end of the case. I will keep that installed, but you can remove if you want the keyboard level.~~

PRICE: $300 + shipping

2. GMK Peaches N Cream Base Kit. This will ship in bags. (there are about 2 more than what is shown ) These have little to no shine and have been used off an on for a few months in my keyboard rotation. Super cute set I just dont have a board for them anymore!

Looking for GMK Alter base, novelties, and spacebars sealed.
 
I'm at the point where I just bought too many things and have more coming, wanted to try each board and sell off the one I liked the least over time but with delays and school I ran out of time. Plus they all kinda showed up at the same time >.>. The keycaps and switches were for builds planned, but couldn't get the board from the raffles. Have extra desk mats that I don't plan on using either.

Adding an extra price for insured shipping with USPS or UPS if you prefer that. As u/notporkjowl pointed out, the insurance helps me as the seller, not you as the buyer so please be aware of it. Have confirmed trades on this sub plus r/hardwareswap and r/watchexchange.

Prioritizing bundles since it'll be less complicated for me to ship.

Hi guys, selling some stuff I do not use anymore.

Please comment before PM, no chat, thanks (there is an auto-generated comment down below where you can click for PM).

If you need more detailed pictures of any of the items, feel free to contact me about it. At the time I was just too lazy xD. --> I've overcome the lazy, click timestamp :3

Bought it from KBDFans during the summer drop, comes with Holy Pandas from Drop and lubed with Krytox 3204 and GMK Screw in Stabilizer (also lubed with krytox 3204).  Also comes with custom coiled cable from mech cables (purchased for $100). Only been used for 3 weeks

CONUS only at the moment unless you have a proxy in the states. Not FCFS. Will be prioritizing trades and bundles over single transactions. I am negotiable on prices. Will be holding off on selling the items until the end of the day to allow time for trade offers if any.

Items that I want to trade for are the following; Black/white HS Vega, GMK Necro, and artisans (bongos, keybys, LPs, ghibli beans, and GAF). I am open to listening to other artisans offers but those are the ones that I am primarily looking for. I am also always buying so if you have any of the items that I listed and want to sell I can do that as well.

I'm very hesitant letting this board go as it is my favorite board in terms of both quality and feel but I'm itching to get my hands on a Keycult 1/60 or 65 (white/brass preferred). The board was originally A- stock but I couldn't find any flaws with it and it is still in flawless condition. Paypal can be added if needed.

The back weight is black anodized rather than an e-coat. It's in flawless condition all-around except for some faint marks on the brass weight (I don't know how they got there but they aren't scratches as they can't be felt and can probably be wiped away). Comes with a brand new PCB and brass plate, not the build pictured. Gaskets were installed on the case,  and also includes the case + PCB foam.

Also includes brass plate, polycarbonate plate and both aluminum and brass accent pieces.

Hey all! Just selling a few things. There’s a few things to note however. I purchased the Rama M60 off of r/mechmarket and I believe I am the second owner of it. There’s some slight scratches on the back weight which I tried to capture. Also the original owner popped out the Kalih hotswap socket and in turn jumped it with a piece of wire. I never soldered a new socket so it’s still there. This doesn’t affect the PCB in any way that I’ve noticed and everything is working flawlessly. Just trying to be as transparent as possible. 

The Metaverse R2 has been mounted and typed on for a couple of days and has been sitting in a keycap container ever since. No shine that I can see. 

Boba U4Ts are lubed and filmed with Tribosys 3204 and Thicc Films. About 10 of them are filmed with Deskeys. 

Rama M60-A: $500 (only due to blemishes and imperfect PCB) will come with Zeal Stabs. SOLD!

Metaverse R2: $280 (will be shipped in bag) SOLD!

Boba U4Ts: $60 SOLD!

Thanks so much for looking and taking the time to read! :)"

Prices include shipping, trying to stick with CON US here. Keyboards come with stabilizers (Cherry stab in on the Ca66, GMK screw in on the Rama), no keycaps or switches.

**Rama M65-A-** Silver/Mist whatever the colorway is called. Brass plate, nylon base to allow underglow. The old PCB broke and has been replaced with a KBD67 one (runs QMK) and the usb port has been modded to fit the USB C. I am not the original owner of this board. In the last picture you can see a piece of the rubber feet is missing and exposes a missing screw. Doesnt affect stability and cant be normally seen but do take note of it. Please see blemishes below **Sold for $320** Can negotiate down if you're really interested, just need a new home for it. Yes original packaging included

**CA66**- Navy colorway. Also not the original owner here. Mostly good condition but do take note one of the standoffs was missing in the top middle screw hole so it cant be screwed and results in the backplate looking like [this](https://i.imgur.com/J0RVM4G.jpg). The rubber feet ensures the keyboard still lies flat. No original packaging **Asking for $150 shipped SOLD**

Trying to clean up a lot of my collection that has just gone unused lately to make way for some more new stuff.  All prices include shipping to the CONUS lower 48 and are negotiable.  Also not opposed to bundles either.  Please let me know if you would like extra pics of anything specific.

And if you happen to have a GMKK Pro avaiable, I’d definitely be interested in offers (either trades or straight purchasing) from you.  I would prefer the Ice White versoin but it’s not a deal breaker if not.

*Keyboards:*

Tada68 ($175) - Vintage Blacks lubed with GPL 103 (thin lube) and spring swapped with 62g SPRiT springs. Clipped and lubed GMK stabs. White LED's. Grey aluminum high profile case and stock white plastic case. Also including an old Pexon mini-USB cable.

~~Iris, Rev. 3 ($145) - comes with Kalih Box Jades.  This was my daily driver for a few months before discovering the 65% layout and it’s just sat around since then.  Works perfectly fine, has the under glow RGB, but there are a few scratches on the plate that don’t affect usability at all.  Will come with the TRRS cable but no USB-C.~~ (SOLD!!)

~~Discipline65 ($165) - v1 with POM plate, white acrylic case, and Stupidfish plate foam installed; used for a few months but just have too many boards right now so moving on from this one.

Hi everyone,

~~I'd like to offer my GMK Darling set for a GMK Taro set. The set has been lightly used for 2 1/2 months. If you have r2 than + accent kit. Let's just negotiate starting and see what we can work out :)~~

Best,

Hey all, over the last year or two I got really...optimistic about how many keyboards I would be building, or needing, or using. It's just so easy to impulse buy things that won't be real for 8 months from now, it's like a present for future me. I'm happy to provide additional pictures of any items at request, I'd hope people would do their due diligence on that anyway. I just got lazy with taking pictures of all these things at once.

Please PM rather than Reddit chat.

Note: There are some artisans in the first timestamp image. I made the last minute decision not to sell those as I was making this post. They're not currently for sale, sorry for the confusion!

Hello everyone, hope you're well. 

Looking to offload a few items that don't see much use:

Item | What's included| Asking
---|---|----
[KFE Round 1](https://imgur.com/a/tIS0TCd)| Silver KFE from r1 (weights are located inside case, not on the bottom, and the connection is Mini USB). Fantastic board, currently built on a PC plate with some of the smoothest retooled blacks I've ever used. Including a free additional mill-maxed h88 PCB. The mill-maxed h88 was a defect pcb as the caps lock is off-center. It was gold mill-maxed to use as a tester pcb before soldering anything, capslock key fit is wonky. That maxes are soldered for both the ANSI and ISO layouts though. Please pay attention to some minor cosmetic blemishes on the board as seen in the album. | $675 Shipped|

This is my first time posting here, I hope the style meets the standards.

I'm selling those very nice prebuilds or hotswaps that can only take 3-pin, mostly because I found my ideal key layout and I bought too many switches. 5-pin switches.

Every keyboard is in like new condition, unboxed and used once or twice, comes with all stock accessories and packaging, except the Massdrop Ctrl is used having its packaging, barebones + keycaps, and the magnetic feet only. Al keyboards have their stabs relubed and fixed so they sound a bit more consistent and nicer than out-of-the-box.

Keychron K6, optical Brown not hot swappable, RGB. $55

Keychron K6, Kailh black, hot swappable, LED. $65

Akko 3068 is firmware updated so the bluetooth connection is stable now (previously it will intermittently disconnect and won’t wake it back, a known issue. Now fixed)

Pricing (including basic USPS ground shipping):

AKKO 3068 Silent Bluetooth Gat Brown, asking $75

AKKO 3084 9009 Gat Red, asking $85

~~Niz Plum 84EC 35g, $old for asking~~

~~NK65 Milkshake, $old for asking~~

~~Massdrop Ctrl low profile, $old for asking, we can talk about switches, it's currently installed with lubed Gat reds with a few non-essential keys on Kailh Speed Copper.~~

&#x200B;

Pricing for keycaps (all from Drop):

Keychron K6 PBT keycaps, new unused. (+$25 for any Keychron K6 purchase)

~~GMK red samurai 65% kit, new but opened to take a look, $old.~~

~~Drop MT3 Dev TTY 65% kit, like new used once, $70.~~

~~IDOBAO Hami Melon base kit + japanese alpha kit, like new used once, $old for asking~~

I consider trades towards a Keychron keyboard (hotswap preferred) for office use or Paypal is fine. Friends far from west coast please consider adding a few bucks so I would use USPS priority shipping, but if you don't want to add for shipping it's totally fine, it's just a bit slower the cheaper way to ship.

Hi [r/mm](https://www.reddit.com/r/mm/)!

I am selling a brand GMK VAPORWAVE.

* ***$440 SHIPPED FROM THE PHILIPPINES*** (FedEx only).

It was opened for inspection, while the extra accent keys are sealed.We can also ship without the tray/sleeve for cheaper rates.

We can use it in a smaller container for cheaper rates. Will bubble wrap everything nicely of course.

To make it easier for buyers:

\- Shipping prices in eu generally are 4-15 euros (depends on various reasons (if it untracked or tracked), how big is the package)

\- Shipping prices to usa/canada generally are 20-70 (depends on various reasons, mostly size and weight affects price exponentially)

\- PRICE<60 € is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € for tracked;

\- 60=<PRICE<100 € (or just generally heavy) is UNTRACKED unless +3 € - 3.5 € for tracked (unless listed otherwise)

\- PRICE=>100+ € items is sent via tracked/registered mail unless asked otherwise;

\- Shipping to UK due to new regulations increase by roughly 3e (just add 3e to current EU price).

|ITEM|PRICE to EUROPE (Shipping, pp fee incl.)|PRICE to USA (Shipping, pp fee incl.)|DESCRIPTION|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**3x 6.5u SPACEBARS \[compatible with something like: K70, K95, Logitech G710+,** **Roccat Ryos MK Pro and more\]**|30 euro (pp fess included, untracked, 2.5 e for tracked)|FAST, IF COMBINED or seperately w/\[slow shipping(1 month+)\] 42 e|Selling 3x 6.5 units size spacebars. For keyboards like Corsair K70/K95 / Logitech G710+ / Roccat Ryos MK Pro - all keyboards having non-standart spacebars. Spacebars are: black matte; matte white; smokey translucent black (also has deepest sound signature).|
|**68x JWK Mauves \[lubed w/205g0\]**|68 e (pp fees and untracked, 2.5 e for tracked)|\-|Lubed with krytox  205g0 by myself|

In the future I may offer lube or soldering services, but I still need 6 (non officialy 2) trades to go :)

The listed items is easily reachable and I can photoshoot them every two weeks. However I have more items (switches, pcbs, keyboard cases), which is too much work to photoshoot (it is really annoying to do that every two weeks), but you can ask me more options and I may list more items.

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-60 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct. You can write to me with a similar price I offer, however if this is not my offering price, there is much lower chance I will sell item right away or at all. Especially if price is fixed
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay, but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, ask :)*"

Hi guys! Here's what I have today.

**Tofu 60% Acrylic Build w/ L+F Ethereal Pandas - 227 + shipping**This board is built with ethereal pandas (lubed with Kyrtox205g0, filmed) I received from the limited group buy a while back (as far as I know they are not being made anymore), a dz60 rgbv2 pcb, genuine gmk stabilizers, a 1.5mm aluminum plate.

This build was my main for a while, I've kept it in excellent condition and will clean it for good measure before shipping out. The acrylic case along with the tactility of the pandas and the foam I added gives it an nice thocky sound.

**Budget 60% Build w/ Tecsee Purple Pandas - 150 + shipping**This build comes with a Kbdfans 60% black plastic case with an aluminum plate, tuned gmk stabilizers, Lubed Tecsee tactile purple pandas, and a 1up HSE hotswap pcb. The case is also foamed, reducing case ping and making the board very thocky.

**PBT Matcha Keycaps - 25 + shipping**These are from aliexpress and come in a very good condition."

These boards have fallen out of the rotation and I would like to give them a good home (All prices are for CONUS shipping):

~~Weytec HK2000C~~ **~~SOLD~~**

[Timestamp](https://imgur.com/IOGdJrc)

~~Very cool precursor to the Weytec MK-06 manufactured by GMK for Weytec, designed for trading floors and featuring Cherry MX Clears and a mix of GMK doubleshot and silk-screened keycaps. Comes with power cable, modular connector box,  USB-B to USB-A cable to connect to a PC and the proprietary connector that goes from the keyboard to the connector box. All fully working.~~

## KBD67MKII V2 E-White Hotswap ($280 shipped)

[Timestamp](https://imgur.com/9A90RzB)

Very lightly used, some light scuffing as a result of pulling switches (see image) but nothing too noticeable. Brass weight and case finish look great. Clear Durock V2 stabs have been installed and the PCB has been flashed for Via.

## Switch Couture Alice Matte Black (See below)

[Timestamp](https://imgur.com/pzxeq3A)

I have a few variants of this board I could do:

* Built with Durcok L7 Linears lubed and filmed + Lubed Durock V2 stabilizers + Project Keyboard Alice PCB rev. 1 with mini USB port  + Wrist Rest ($300 shipped)
* Dis-assembled with case + Project Keyboard Alice PCB rev. 2 with USB C port + Wrist Rest ($300 shipped)

Reposting, with adjusted prices. Feel free to make an offer if these seem unreasonable. Been out of the mechmarket game for too long!

Clearing out my collection of keyboards and keycaps. These are some of the favourites in my collection that I have not wanted to let go, but no point them collecting dust and unused. Better they find a new, loving home!

Price in USD.

Excludes shipping from Metro Vancouver, BC. For keycaps, they would probably be \~$10 CONUS without trays.

**SOLD** **~~GMK Metropolis R1: Base, Signs Novelty, Blocks Spacebar Kit - $320 + shipping~~**

~~Beautiful keycap set, with stunning colours and that sharp GMK legend and keycap quality. These were used once, and then forgotten at the back of a cabinet as I was worried about shining them over them. Funny how that works out. (No, there is no shine on them. I hardly used them!)~~

~~Comes with original trays and packaging. I can repackage these into ziploc bags to save on shipping as well.~~

**DSA Think Different: Base Set, Standard Modifiers, Additional Modifiers, Numpad, Blanks - $120 + shipping**

This is a wonderful DSA with thick PBT, and Mac legends. I find PMK keycaps sound wonderfully thocky on many boards that is quite different from others. Lots of coverage here with the additional modifiers and blanks, as well as the flexibilty of the DSA profile. Should work with almost any layout.

Shipped in ziploc bags."

Its in excellent condition, plate has a few scratches from removing switches but they are not noticeable with keycaps on. I did mod the switches (205g0 on bottom house rails a-la-Gazzew, 105 bag lubed springs, DangKeebs gasket films) and the stabs (XHT-BDZ/Dragon Ball Z on wires and housing and KBDFans stab foam on the PCB).~~

1. **~~x100 Stock Dogikon Switches $60~~** ~~- bought from another mm user but never got around to using them and good lord I need to think my switch herd. Will ship in the switch box that I received them in.~~ **Sold for Asking**
2. [**~~x70 Scuffed L&F Banana Split Switches with Thick Thock DL 65g Springs $70~~**](https://imgur.com/aXi0t7k) ~~- bought lubed and filmed from another user, put them in a board with a super tight plate and mangled the tops trying to get the switches out of the board. I took them apart and cleaned everything with an ultrasonic cleaner and alcohol swabs. Then I spring swapped in Thick Thock DL 65g springs bag lubed with Krytox 105 in, filmed with white Deskeys films, Krytox 205g0 on the rails a-la-Gazzew's method. They feel wonderful but its been a months long saga with them and its time we part ways. Will ship in the banana split container.~~ **Sold for Asking**

* Layout: 7u spacebar; stepped Capslock

Hello, back with another post! Just letting go of some stuff to fund my CRP R4 order. I normally would strike through product descriptions, but I will leave them up to help guide those who are looking to purchase any of the items listed below. 

Highly prefer shipping to USA addresses at the moment. All prices include USPS Priority Mail shipping costs.

**If you are local to 94706, I am fine doing local pickup/meetup and will lower price to reflect it.**

No external flaws I could find. Very solid TKL esp to start out with, but I have two nicer ones pending and there's no reason for me to keep this one. Switches and stabs not included as I did list the board built previously but no one was interested. Not splitting the board and PCBs unless I get two different people asking for each item.  **Price is now lower than what I paid for everything at retail!** | $380 shipped | yes!


**I AM ALSO ACCEPTING TRADE OFFERS THAT INCLUDE GMK DARLING'S EXTENSION AND/OR SPACEBARS KIT**

Priority for responding to offers will be as follows:

 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing all items for asking price

Outside of the listed conditions, I'll check based on when you comment **and** PM. The PM is absolutely necessary for the sale of these items. Please understand that if you as a buyer and I agree on a price and you back out of the purchase right after I send the invoice, I will refuse to sell anything to you in the future (yes, that includes if you offer me something like $300 on something that I'm selling for much less). 

 **Do not use the chat function**, I honestly don't know how you are taken to the chat function when the bot's verification post gives you a link to PM sellers. I will ignore you and you won't be in consideration for anything until you send me a PM. I will also ignore you if you do not comment before sending a PM.

If I don't respond, it's likely because I'm just busy doing other things. I will get to all messages accompanying comments in a timely manner. Thank you for your time."

Black acrylic on top, clear/translucent (see pics) neon green on the bottom. Has RGB underglow. Built with lubed and filmed Gat Black Inks. Durock stabs. 

Should be noted, I do not know the exact details of the case, I think the person I bought it from had it custom cut? It seems to look more like a Switch Couture Alice but [it has the Wonderland PCB](https://i.imgur.com/I39qU99.jpg) so I'm not sure what to call it. It's neat though.

Used for less than a month. Ended up getting an HHKB Type-S and have fully convented to that layout. Excellent feeling board.

|[~~ai03 Polaris WK - Olive Green~~](https://imgur.com/a/FyhJXfe)|~~The olive green is a pretty rare colorway from the original gb — I believe only 20 were made according to the discord. The back weight is black anodized rather than an e-coat. It's in flawless condition all-around except for some faint marks on the brass weight (I don't know how they got there but they aren't scratches as they can't be felt and can probably be wiped away). Comes with a brand new PCB and brass plate, not the build pictured. Gaskets were installed on the case,  and also includes the case + PCB foam. The board looks absolutely stunning with Botanical, I would've totally kept it if it were WKL.~~|~~$590 OBO~~|

Both are new and unused. I bought them from others on Reddit thinking that they would be brand new and **sealed**. They are new but opened in tray/box. Just been sitting on a shelf for months. Would like to get some other **SEALED** GMK sets. If you have a sealed taro or Metaverse I’ll trade and add on top. But really open to most GMK set trades. Don’t really need the cash but if you just want to buy them shoot me a offer. Will also take RAMA Artisans, again only looking for Brand new with original packaging.

Looking to see if there's any interest in trading the 2 PSA Slabs I have for some nice keebs or keycap sets. I got 2 Graded cards, one being a 1996 CD Promotion Charizard Card graded as a Mint 9 and a 2016 Pokemon Center Promotion Card that has been graded as a Gem Mint 10. Please refer to the timestamp for more photos.

Would prefer trading locally for those located in the Bay Area (California) as it would make trading so much easier :)

I don't have anything in particular that I'm looking for, but would love to see what you can offer.

This is a complete numpad, just plug it in with a usb-c cable and it's ready to go. Hotswap, so you can swap in other switches if you'd like, and the POM plate gives it a nice thock.

Custom cable is USB MINI and originally designed to match Heavy Industry. But should go nicely with anything yellow.

Hello, back with another post! Just letting go of some stuff to fund my CRP R4 order. I normally would strike through product descriptions, but I will leave them up to help guide those who are looking to purchase any of the items listed below. 

Highly prefer shipping to USA addresses at the moment. All prices include USPS Priority Mail shipping costs.

**If you are local to 94706, I am fine doing local pickup/meetup and will lower price to reflect it.**

Item|Details|Price|Available
:--|:--|:--|:--
[Freyr TKL](https://i.imgur.com/41RVtZy.jpg) | black WK with red weight and alu plate. includes two Mechlovin infinity87 PCBs, one cleanly desoldered with an FR-301 and the other completely brand new. No external flaws I could find. Very solid TKL esp to start out with, but I have two nicer ones pending and there's no reason for me to keep this one. Switches and stabs not included as I did list the board built previously but no one was interested. Not splitting the board and PCBs unless I get two different people asking for each item. | $415 shipped | yes!


**I AM ALSO ACCEPTING TRADE OFFERS THAT INCLUDE GMK DARLING'S EXTENSION AND/OR SPACEBARS KIT**

Priority for responding to offers will be as follows:

 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing all items for asking price

Outside of the listed conditions, I'll check based on when you comment **and** PM. The PM is absolutely necessary for the sale of these items. Please understand that if you as a buyer and I agree on a price and you back out of the purchase right after I send the invoice, I will refuse to sell anything to you in the future (yes, that includes if you offer me something like $300 on something that I'm selling for much less). 

 **Do not use the chat function**, I honestly don't know how you are taken to the chat function when the bot's verification post gives you a link to PM sellers. I will ignore you and you won't be in consideration for anything until you send me a PM. I will also ignore you if you do not comment before sending a PM.

If I don't respond, it's likely because I'm just busy doing other things. I will get to all messages accompanying comments in a timely manner. Thank you for your time."

Everything I am selling I believe is a little below market. I am not interested in ""ripping"" anyone off or inflating prices. A few subjects of note:

* The Cyber Voyager has a small nick on the right side, it came factory like that unfortunately. I have pink and green badges for it. The pink are currently in use and the green will be in the box. This will come with the original tools and accessories in box.
* No keycaps will come in the original box unless you would like to play a little extra, also of note, all keycaps are lightly used, there is slight shine on most sets, I am pricing them accordingly.
* For everyone's convenience and financial safety I am only comfortable with using Paypal. Please don't ask for another method.
* Comment before you send a PM, no chat please.
* For the Tofu HHKB, the brass weight does not have a little magnet so it slides back and forth and comes out freely. Either KBDFans or a hobby shop probably has the size magnet you need to correct this.

Can be bundled with the pictured GMK Olivia Dark set/7u pink spacebar for around $250 more if interested.|$770 OBO|
|[ai03 Polaris WK - Olive Green](https://imgur.com/a/FyhJXfe)|The olive green is a pretty rare colorway from the original gb — I believe only 20 were made according to the discord. The back weight is black anodized rather than an e-coat. It's in flawless condition all-around except for some faint marks on the brass weight (I don't know how they got there but they aren't scratches as they can't be felt and can probably be wiped away). Comes with a brand new PCB and brass plate, not the build pictured. Gaskets were installed on the case,  and also includes the case + PCB foam. The board looks absolutely stunning with Botanical, I would've totally kept it if it were WKL.|$590 OBO|

Hello there mechmarket, I recently came to the decision it's time for me to get rid of a lot of excess keyboard stuff I've got laying around. I intended to build a lot of new keyboard, but have simply never gotten around to it and no longer see myself as having the time/energy to do so. So, there's a whole lot of stuff I've got that I'm looking to sell. Everything is brand new/unused unless otherwise noted. Sorry about the mess that is organization here and in the pictures, it's my first time selling this much stuff at once so please bear with me! I also ask for some patience while I ship some of these things out as it may take me a bit of time to get everything packed up. Prices all include shipping already unless buying from outside the continental US.

After waiting over 4 years it actually arrived, now my collection is already too large so I'm looking at passing this on.

&nbsp;

Flawless case, have only taken it out of box for photos    
- Silver Top    
- Black bottom    
- Have checked the pcb and confirmed working    
- Upgraded to brass plate    
- Upgraded to Mod-M switches    
- Included GMK Keycaps    
- Stabilisers were missing however I have plenty of sets of Cherry/GMK stabs, so happy to throw a set in if you need them    

&nbsp;

Price: GBP £700 + shipping    
Happy to ship anywhere in the world, UK and EU are preferable    
Will ship in the original foam and box so shouldn't be any problems there    

&nbsp;

I'm not desperate to let it go so I'm pretty firm on price I'm afraid, but I will listen to sensible offers.    

&nbsp;

Also just to note I'll be back and forth from my computer over the next 24hrs so please don't worry if I take some time to reply, I'll get back to you as soon as I can!"

To make it easier for buyers:

\- Shipping prices in eu generally are 4-15 euros (depends on various reasons (if it untracked or tracked), how big is the package)

\- Shipping prices to usa/canada generally are 20-70 (depends on various reasons, mostly size and weight affects price exponentially)

\- PRICE<60 € is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € for tracked;

\- 60=<PRICE<100 € (or just generally heavy) is UNTRACKED unless +3 € - 3.5 € for tracked (unless listed otherwise)

\- PRICE=>100+ € items is sent via tracked/registered mail unless asked otherwise;

\- Shipping to UK due to new regulations increase by roughly 3e (just add 3e to current EU price).

A bundle to make your cyberpunk themed dream setup. Paid EU VAT and other customs fees for all items. I really like laser colorway and planned to make themed setup with this bundle, but I am saving money for other things, so selling it. If no one will buy this in a month time I am probably gonna use for my next build, so don't wait. Prioritizing eu citizens as VAT is already paid and dandy but can send to usa using premium shipping (it is expensive but people loves this shipping)|

In the future I may offer lube or soldering services, but I still need 6 (non officialy 2) trades to go :)

The listed items is easily reachable and I can photoshoot them every two weeks. However I have more items (switches, pcbs, keyboard cases), which is too much work to photoshoot (it is really annoying to do that every two weeks), but you can ask me more options and I may list more items.

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-60 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct. You can write to me with a similar price I offer, however if this is not my offering price, there is much lower chance I will sell item right away or at all. Especially if price is fixed
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay, but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, ask :)*"

Keyboard will come assembled with the built soldered PCB, both white badges attached and case/battery foam installed.

I tried to find/list all the wear present but please keep in mind that this is not a brand new keyboard and even those don't come 100% perfect.

Small mark on the right side on the chamfer of the top case and on the right side of the bottom case. Basically the anodization has been removed so it's a bit silver there. Not very noticeable in my opinion.

There is signficiant wear to the anodization in the screw holes on the bottom of the case and the top part where the bottom screw attachs to the top part. Peep the pictures and you'll see what I mean. There is no damage to the threads and the screws go in easily. Cosmetic and something you will never see as it'll be covered up the screw head anyway.

Hey guys! Like always, I have to get rid of stuff as I get more stuff in. So this is on the chopping block! Some of the caps have the early early beginnings of shine. You have to look for it, but I feel it'd be disingenuous to say no shine. Prices include fees and shipping to CONUS. Not particularly interested in shipping international but we could discuss it. I'm open to offers though since I need to clear up space! Bundle largely preferred for Metropolis, but if I have buyers for each part I'll split it up.

Hey all, selling my daily driver as I picked up a new keeb recently. 

I have a Cherry B Sakabato 87, Founders Edition (meaning its chrome plated and serialized). Extras include the extra Cloud brass weight for the early run, an extra daughterboard, and StupidFish case + plate foam. The pcb is currently soldered with L/F Alpacas, however I believe they are releasing a hotswap, via compatible pcb soon. The case is in good condition, with a slight knick right above the arrow keys, along with visible dust specks that come with having a chrome keyboard. These are pictured in the timestamp

Also letting go of GMK Botanical I picked up during the extras a while back. No shine, great condition. I am only willing to sell along with the keyboard as a package to one buyer.

Prices:

Sakabato 87 Founders Edition + GMK botanical: $1000 + shipping to US only

Contact me for more pics/details if needed. Please send paypal along with message if willing to buy for the invoice.

Please comment before PM, thanks! :)"

Looking to offload a few items that don't see much use:

Item | What's included| Asking
---|---|----
[KFE Round 1](https://imgur.com/a/tIS0TCd)| Silver KFE from r1 (weights are located inside case, not on the bottom, and the connection is Mini USB). Fantastic board, currently built on a PC plate with some of the smoothest retooled blacks I've ever used. Comes with a free additional mill-maxed h88 PCB. The mill-maxed h88 was a defect pcb as the caps lock is off-center. It was gold mill-maxed to use as a tester pcb before soldering anything, capslock key fit is wonky. That maxes are soldered for both the ANSI and ISO layouts though. Please pay attention to some minor cosmetic blemishes on the board as seen in the album. | $700 Shipped|
~~[OG Skidata 1800 Keyboard](https://i.imgur.com/HzwwPl7.jpg)~~| Very good condition (some minor paint wear on side of board) with OG Cherry doubleshots in EU layout with relegendables (N9). MX Clears | ~~$160 shipped~~ Sold for asking

Was hoping that aqua would match GMK Noel better, but I think it would look a lot better on a white case.

Looking to trade **JUST THE CASE**, no daughterboard or anything else.

Finish seems fine according to CK standards. No glaring issues, just the typical to be expected of how they finished the board."

* Comes with an extra universal 60% FR4 plate

I can also provide a sound test if anyone would like and can also send more photos if requested, so feel free to ask (sound test would be with the FR4 Plate installed because that's how it's currently built)

More Jane V2 CE pics: https://imgur.com/a/8Mmt9IL

It's time for me to sell some things I like in order to buy something for someone that I love.

Up are some of my most prized/coveted/unused keyboards from my collection. All have been built, loved, and used by yours truly. 

Each board will be sold in the config that it's in, WITHOUT KEYCAPS. I'll remove those before I ship, obviously. If anyone wants an extra PCB or FR4 plate you know where to look. 

All boards will only be sold via PayPal invoice, and insured for the cost of the board. Domestically, I can ship either USPS or FedEx. Internationally, I'll only ship via DHL.

All prices are negotiable. If you want to offer less than listed, please do so! Market price is fair price.

Here we goooo:

Reposting because apparently I can't put too much info in the title.

Hello, back with another post! Just letting go of some stuff to fund my CRP R4 order. I normally would strike through product descriptions, but I will leave them up to help guide those who are looking to purchase any of the items listed below. 

Highly prefer shipping to USA addresses at the moment. All prices include USPS Priority Mail shipping costs.

**KEYCAPS ARE NOT INCLUDED WITH EITHER OF THE BOARDS LISTED**

**If you are local to 94706, I am fine doing local pickup/meetup and will lower price to reflect it.**

Item|Details|Price|Available
:--|:--|:--|:--
[Stellar65 with extra l/f Alpacas](https://i.imgur.com/wYhDjyw.jpg) | the new Stellar65 sold through SpaceCables, built with 62g lubed/filmed Alpacas (70g on spacebar) lubed with 205g0 and Durock v2 stabilizers lubed with 205g0. PCB has both per-key and underglow RGB. The case is slightly lowered in price because I was trying to fix something and accidentally [cracked one of the layers right around one of the standoffs](https://i.imgur.com/RpptguZ.jpg). This does not impact the function of the board in any way. The rest of the price accounts for the switches, stabs, lubing, and assembly. If you don't want to take the chance of missing a future restock, and you're looking to get one of your first really solid boards that's ready to use (especially if you want a stellar65 and don't want to solder), this is probably the deal for you. | ~~$280 shipped~~ | **SOLD FOR ASKING PRICE**
[Freyr TKL](https://i.imgur.com/41RVtZy.jpg) | black WK with red weight and alu plate. includes one Mechlovin infinity87 PCB with C3 v2 stabs lubed with 205g0 and Krytox XHT-BDZ, and an extra infinity87 PCB (never soldered). No external flaws I could find. Very solid TKL, but I have two nicer ones pending and there's no reason for me to keep this one. If you're interested in having the build pictured (65g ergo clears lubed with 3204), add $40 to the price. Otherwise, the PCB will be desoldered prior to shipping. | $425 shipped (add $40 if you want the switches as well) | yes!


**I AM ALSO ACCEPTING TRADE OFFERS THAT INCLUDE GMK DARLING'S EXTENSION AND/OR SPACEBARS KIT**

Priority for responding to offers will be as follows:

 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing all items for asking price
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and having both items I'm looking to trade for (we'll discuss if either side needs to add PayPal)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and having one item I'm looking to trade for (we'll discuss if either side needs to add PayPal)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any item of your choice for asking price

Outside of the listed conditions, I'll check based on when you comment **and** PM. The PM is absolutely necessary for the sale of these items. Please understand that if you as a buyer and I agree on a price and you back out of the purchase right after I send the invoice, I will refuse to sell anything to you in the future (yes, that includes if you offer me something like $300 on something that I'm selling for much less). 

 **Do not use the chat function**, I honestly don't know how you are taken to the chat function when the bot's verification post gives you a link to PM sellers. I will ignore you and you won't be in consideration for anything until you send me a PM. I will also ignore you if you do not comment before sending a PM.

If I don't respond, it's likely because I'm just busy doing other things. I will get to all messages accompanying comments in a timely manner. Thank you for your time."

|[Rama M60-A Olivia Edition - Hotswap](https://imgur.com/a/e75n9d6)|Beautiful board with a heavy PVD rose gold brass weight, still in great condition. Bought it recently on mm but I have to unfortunately let it go to clear funds for other purchases. Comes with the original rama box and all accessories. Can be bundled with the pictured GMK Olivia Dark set/7u pink spacebar for around $250 more if interested.|$770|
|[ai03 Polaris WK - Olive Green](https://imgur.com/a/FyhJXfe)|The olive green is a pretty rare colorway from the original gb — I believe only 20 were made according to the discord. The back weight is black anodized rather than an e-coat. It's in flawless condition all-around except for some faint marks on the brass weight (I don't know how they got there but they aren't scratches as they can't be felt and can probably be wiped away). Comes with a brand new PCB and brass plate, not the build pictured. Gaskets were installed on the case,  and also includes the case + PCB foam. The board looks absolutely stunning with Botanical, I would've totally kept it if it were WKL. Can be bundled with the extra plates for a discounted price, just ask.|$595|

|[Instant60 Tsangan Hotswap PCB](https://imgur.com/VFpk507)|Great working condition, has warm white switch LEDs and RGB underglow. Works great with the Polaris and can bundle with it for a discounted price.|$45|

Looking to trade these for really anything keyboard related, prefer GMK keycaps or such. Bought both of these a while ago and kind of moved away from the styling of them and don't see myself wearing them, and having $800 of shoes sit in my closet not doing anything with seems like a waste.

One pair of Yeezy Boost 350 v2 Sesame, and one pair of Cinders. If requested by buyer, can provide proof of purchase from GOAT for the Sesame pair, and proof of purchase from Adidas for the Cinder pair.

Sesame Size - 9.5

Cinder Size - 10

Both are in great condition, only wore the sesames a handful of times with crep protect on them, no marks or scuffs on shoe, only slight discoloration on the bottoms, and slight wearing of the insole. Still in great wearable condition. Pricing for new on GOAT right now is $488. Pricing these around $300ish for trades seems fair given their condition and verifiability.

For the Cinder they were only wore twice in total, almost no discoloration on the bottoms, no wear on insole, also has crep protect on them with zero marks or scuffs on outside. Right now on GOAT new is $450, looking to price these at $300ish for trades given they're basically brand new.

Each party pays shipping to one another, ONLY SHIPPING WITHIN CONUS.

Upon request from interested party, can provide more photos and such."

# Keycap sets

*Take $5 off if shipped in bags rather than original boxes/trays*

1. [**~~GMK Delta $300~~**](https://imgur.com/AtHNV7C) ~~- Bought from another mm user earlier this year and honestly this set is in wonderful condition. I don't see any shine from the previous owner and I have not mounted/used the set. I'd be looking to send these in a set of ePBT trays or in bags - I do have the original packaging and can send it along with the keycaps but the trays are the sad cardboard GMK ones and are scuffed just from existing.~~ **Sold for Asking**
2. [**ePBT Gray on White $75**](https://imgur.com/yjK9jtd) \- New from Divinikey and still currently in stock. Will ship in the original box/trays.
3. [**KAT Specimen Base $180**](https://imgur.com/ldxmf1A)\- bought new from another mm user, mounted once but did not use. Will ship in original box/trays. Bundle with the Numpad & Colors kit for $240.
4. [**KAT Specimen Numpad & Colors $80**](https://imgur.com/VSEyllA)**-** bought new from another mm user, opened, but never mounted. Scuffed the little box when opening it but will ship in original box/tray. Bundle with base kit for $240.
5. [**~~Infinikey Aether $180~~**](https://imgur.com/01B7Dby) ~~- bought new from another mm user, mounted and used on my personal board for a few weeks (not my daily work driver). Minimal use, excellent condition. Will ship in original box/trays.~~ **Sold for Asking**
6. [**NPKC 61 Keys Sunset Blue Gradient Side Print Caps (NOT shine through) $40**](https://imgur.com/1d9R45u) \- Bought from another mm user as part of a bundle. Ended up not using these and want to pass them on. Will ship in a bag. Image is from a recent post but can send an updated photo if requested.

# Keyboards

1. [**Epomaker GK96S $110**](https://imgur.com/hRv0tMF) \- Right hand numpad/Bluetooth/Gateron Reds. I was really after a right hand and a left hand version of this board but because I wasn't paying attention I ended up with two right hand ones. The previous owner only used it for a few days and I didn't end up using this one. Its in excellent condition, plate has a few scratches from removing switches but they are not noticeable with keycaps on. I did mod the switches (205g0 on bottom house rails a-la-Gazzew, 105 bag lubed springs, DangKeebs gasket films) and the stabs (XHT-BDZ/Dragon Ball Z on wires and housing and KBDFans stab foam on the PCB).

I am looking to trade a few artisans that I have, and possibly sell some of the other ones. I am looking specifically for Hellocaps Tanuki or Mocha colorway.

&#x200B;

 I also have a black lemo cable made by Coaxius (this cable is amazing and the quality is the best I've owned) I am just looking to get a different color for a new set up!

Rama Thermal Milk | This is the HHKB hotswap configuration. I've used the board on and off for the last 2 months. absolutely love the feel but the look just isn't for me. Board is in pristine shape, there may be a small scratch or two on the plate from removing switches that can't be seen when keycaps are in place. Board will be shipped in all original packaging with all included extra hardware. Keycaps and switches are not included but would be willing to bundle on a full lightly used set of GMK Bleached also in original trays and sleeve. Product page can be found [here](https://ramaworks.store/products/foundry-thermal) however you won't see Milk as an option for colorway as this was a limited release. | Think6.5 v2 2u Storm Trooper, Ocean, Valentine, Cute Assassin, or Deep Ocean. Other 60%/65%/75% board, prefer WK or WKL, prefer hotswap. ($750 w/o caps, $965 w caps)

Hi everyone, selling my silver KBD75v2. Here are the specs:

* Aluminum plate
* 67g Zealios lubed with Tribosys 3204
* GMK screw-ins (pre-retooled; clipped + lubed with dielectric for wire and 3204 for housing)
* Brass weight
* KBDfans case foam

Will also come with its original silver aluminum weight and spare screws. The board is currently O-ring mounted for a softer typing feel and to remove hardpoints, and if requested can be reverted back to tray mount using the spare screws. No standoffs have been drilled. Here's a [sound test](https://imgur.com/a/3lQn2Df) in tray-mount configuration with ePBT 9009.

This was built back in 2019, and was used a couple times a week for about a year. I'm selling because I haven't used it since mid 2020 - I've got too many other boards in my rotation. Hopefully it will get more use from a new owner.

I'm asking for ~~US$260 + Shipping OBO~~ **SOLD for $240**. Willing to negotiate!"

Hi guys,

I am looking to sell or trade my Duck Octagon V3  
These are the specs:

* Case colour: Silver 
* Build with FEIs ( SPRiT 65g s , lubed with Krytox 205G0S, TX-Switch-Films)
* GMK Screw Ins (205 G0)
* PET plate 
* Internal brass weight
* Extra PCB & aluminium plate
* Build in ISO layout with large left shift & 7u bottom row (see picture)  


The board has a bit of discolouration next to one screw hole (see picture) because I used an inadequate screwdriver once. Only visible from the bottom & when you look closely. Other than that the condition is excellent.

Moving soon, trying to downsize my collection in the process. 

Lots of CP layout keyboards - IMO one of the most attractive looking layouts, but I just can't really justify the space it takes up on my desk since I never use the numpad.

Prices don't include shipping, but for anyone in the US and Canada it'll likely be between $15 and $30. Happy to ship to the EU or elsewhere, but be aware that shipping to some countries can be super expensive from Canada.

Hey MM,

Today I am selling my barely used drop alt high profile with lubed Tealios V2 switches. I thought I would use this keyboard more than I did, but for the past couple of months, it has just been sitting on a shelf. 

The keyboard is a Drop Alt High Profile in black, with Stupidfish1 case and plate foam, lubed GMK plate mount stabs, Tealios V2 switches that are lubed with Krytox 205g0. I am looking to get **$200** for the keyboard + switches but I am open to offers."

**FYI: R2 went live on Omnitype today.**

Too many sets, not enough boards... so I'm looking to let go of this nostalgic set cause I no longer have a board to go with it. The set is lightly used and I see just a hint of shine under the right lighting condition. Feel free to make your own judgment from the photos.

For those that don't want to wait for a year+ or think the R2 mods are whack, this is for you.

**Pizza 65 Black Graphite:**Just keep getting deeper into the hobby and need to make room for new boards that I like more. It is currently built with the polished brass plate. The installed brass plate is scratched up from removing switches but I will include a second brand new and unused polished brass plate along with the board. It will come with a bunch of extra pizza stickers in different designs and will be shipped in the original box and with the original spare screws. 

GMK Cafe is not included or for sale

**Instant 65 PCB**

This is the pcb currently in the Pizza and is in the cool white led configuration. There is one key that does not work, the key directly to the right of the spacebar. I never found myself using that key in daily use but it should be fixable with bridging. I am reducing its value to $35 as a result.

**Y-CP 65% Keyboard Sleeve**

I commissioned this from Y-CP keyboards and really like the quality of the sleeve. However, since I put the pizza 65 logo, but am not keeping the pizza, I would like to try and sell this along with it if possible.

There is also case foam installed from MKUltra.  For switches it has Durock T1 67g tactile switches for the alphas/numbers, with lubed cherry mx black switches for the big keys. There is also a Khail box jade for the escape key.  I'd be happy to replace this switch with another T1 if you prefer.

The case is made from zebra wood (I think) and includes a wooden wrist rest which has bowed and so no longer sits flat.  This should be able to be straightened out according to guides online, but I don't use a wrist rest anymore.

I am selling this as a complete setup for $270 or best offer.  I am also interested in the following trades (will throw in cash depending).

-	White or clear TKL/75% with exploded function and navigation cluster.
-	Alice style keyboard
-	HHKB with Topres, white preferably.

\^\^\^ From the picture already sold: Oblivion, Original Canoe PCB and extra weight

&#x200B;

Hey guys, I am freeing up some space for the new projects

All prices include PayPal fees, invoice only. As usual please comment before DM, no chat.

**Worldwide shipping,** will be calculated on request, please DM for that. For artisans around $10, for keyboard it should be $40-50, If a keyboard buyer is in the USA I suggest using a more reliable and quicker service, should be around $80

Please note that mail services are still somewhat unpredictable, so shipping might take a long time. Apologies in advance.

&#x200B;

**1.** **Fully built Percent Studio Canoe Gen1 polycarbonate**

[Detailed pics and condition](https://imgur.com/a/4xKx5Qk)

* Built with an aftermarket PCB and an FR4 plate from [Mechlovin](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/gxtgio/gb_mechlovin_kanu_canoe_v1_compatible_pcb_plates/). Fully tuned H1s (Deskeys films, lubed with 203g2, TX 60g springs lubed with TX oil) and C3 stabs. Used Kester solder.
* PCB has support for VIA and many layouts (split backspace, split spacebar etc, see [their post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/gxtgio/gb_mechlovin_kanu_canoe_v1_compatible_pcb_plates/))
* I did enamel infills for the front and back engravings. Front is yellow (matches GMK Serika perfectly), back is dark gray with a subtle golden pearl (see pictures)

Condition:

* I accidentally touched a spot on the back weight (near 0) with a solvent, it's shinier than other surfaces. Noticeable under certain angles, see pictures
* Polycarbonate texture is a little different around infills after wiping, noticeable under certain angles, see pictures.
* Otherwise the case is pretty much perfect, might be light signs of use, but no nicks or scuffs.
* Mechloving PCB: built once, never desoldered.

&#x200B;

Only sold as a bundle

I can desolder the switches for you (Hakko FR-301) but they will still be a part of the bundle.

Feel free to reach out for more details and/or pictures.

|Think6.5 V1 Frosted Poly Hotswap|Has GMK retooled stabs (may want to swap or retune, not my best job). Flashed with VIA. Used pretty lightly for a few months. Includes regular brass badge and polycarbonate badge (from giveaway). One thing to note is that the PCB USB-C connection isn't perfect. Moving the board will sometimes lead to the board reconnecting, which can be of an annoyance. I feel like people might be wary of purchasing because of the issue, however, it is a pretty rare occurrence; [here's an example of it happening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9uZ7N-7Obg). If it wasn't apparent, I had to really force it to happen. [Sound test with inks](https://soundcloud.com/junhyukee/think65-gateron-inks)|$500 shipped OBO|
|~~HHKB Pro 2~~ \+ 60 stock domes|Has Hasu Controller, Stock 45g domes, Stock blank caps, lubed with 3204, Deskeys #3 silencing rings + 1 x-ring due to running out, lined with sorbothane.  Does not include stock controller. Also comes with the stock non-accent esc/ctrl keys. One of my favorite boards, but unfortunately it hasn't been used recently. Added bump-ons, has 3d printed usb port covers. One note, some of the screw housings for the pcb screws have been stripped (3-4). The screws go in, but don't tighten all the way. This doesn't affect the experience, but the board isn't perfect! [Sound test](https://soundcloud.com/junhyukee/hhkb)|~~$200 shipped OBO~~|

[**SPACE65: CyberVoyager** - **$680 shipped**](https://imgur.com/a/p051X4z)

Comes with:

 * Case (ocean colorway) (bump-ons attached, 1 additional included)
 * Built Soldered PCB (CV PCB, working LEDs, original plate foam installed)
  * Holy T1 (Durock T1 housing + halo stem, lightly lubed + Deskey filmed)

 * Bottom Right Weight (black)
 * Underside Weight (black)
 * Screws (7 plate screws, 4 case screws)
 * LED diffuser (left side)
 * Original case/battery foam

___

Keyboard will come assembled with the built soldered PCB, both white badges attached and case/battery foam installed.

I tried to find/list all the wear present but please keep in mind that this is not a brand new keyboard and even those don't come 100% perfect.

Small mark on the right side on the chamfer of the top case and on the right side of the bottom case. Basically the anodization has been removed so it's a bit silver there. Not very noticeable in my opinion.

There is signficiant wear to the anodization in the screw holes on the bottom of the case and the top part where the bottom screw attachs to the top part. Peep the pictures and you'll see what I mean. There is no damage to the threads and the screws go in easily. Cosmetic and something you will never see as it'll be covered up the screw head anyway.

Hello everyone, hope you're well. 

Looking to offload a few items that don't see much use:

Item | What's included| Asking
---|---|----
[KFE Round 1](https://imgur.com/a/tIS0TCd)| Silver KFE from r1 (weights are located inside case, not on the bottom, and the connection is Mini USB). Fantastic board, currently built on a PC plate with some of the smoothest retooled blacks I've ever used. Comes with an additional mill-maxed h88 PCB. The mill-maxed h88 was a defect pcb so the caps lock is off-center. It was gold mill-maxed to use as a tester pcb before soldering anything. I have a switch that'll make the standard caps key fit but it doesn't solder in. That maxes are soldered for both the ANSI and ISO layouts though. Please pay attention to some minor cosmetic blemishes on the board as seen in the album. | $700 Shipped|
~~[CRP APL \(r2.2\)](https://i.imgur.com/Nk54f5w.jpg)~~| Great condition. PLEASE NOTE this r2.2 set is missing the ""]"" keycap, which unfortunately never came from the manufacturer. This has been replaced with an extra keycap from a tulip add-on kit. CRP r2.2 kits do not support WKL layout without an add-on WKL kit. Used lightly for 3-4 weeks. Can add a WKL kit for extra. | ~~$180 shipped~~ Sold with WKL kit for $200
~~[JTK Red Riot Bundle](https://i.imgur.com/BCocwbP.jpg)~~| Never used by me, not used very much by the original owner. No shine as far as I can see. Paired with a zambumon red hexagon deskmat to match the set.| ~~$70 shipped~~ Sold for asking

Not FCFS. Preference in favor of bundles and anyone I have traded with previously. Will consider offers as well. Mainly looking to ship in CONUS.

Lastly, I'm looking to pick up a set of either GMK or OG dolch keycaps. Let me know if you have some you'd be willing to let go of :)

Rama Thermal Milk | This is the HHKB hotswap configuration. I've used the board on and off for the last 2 months. absolutely love the feel but the look just isn't for me. Board is in pristine shape, there may be a small scratch or two on the plate from removing switches that can't be seen when keycaps are in place. Board will be shipped in all original packaging with all included extra hardware. Keycaps and switches are not included but would be willing to bundle on a full lightly used set of GMK Bleached also in original trays and sleeve. Product page can be found [here](https://ramaworks.store/products/foundry-thermal) however you won't see Milk as an option for colorway as this was a limited release. | Think6.5 v2 2u Storm Trooper, Ocean, Valentine, Cute Assassin, or Deep Ocean. Other 60%/65%/75% board, prefer WK or WKL, prefer hotswap. ($750 w/o caps, $965 w caps)

For sale is my Drop Laser Alt HP barebones with box and unused keycap and switch puller. The board is in perfect condition and only selling due to a recent purchase of a GMMK Pro.

Description of switches from the user I bought from here :

* Kailh Pro housings and springs
* Aliaz stems
* Springs lubed with Krytox 105
* Stems are unlubed because I didn't want to diminish the tactility or make the dampening pads sticky
* Kailh Pro housings have a tighter leaf than stock Aliaz housing, so this frankenswitch is noticeably more tactile than stock Aliaz but at the cost of slightly louder sound. On the bright side, I think that silent switches sound kinda nice, almost like a Topre thock

Hope everyone is staying well! Due to my recent move to 40% keyboards, my CA66 needs to find a loving home! I'm primarily looking for trades for bundles of rare ETF Dental Plans and/or Al Bumens. More details below:

E-white CA66 built with lubed 62g Holy Bobas and GMK Cafe base kit (also includes RAMA Bean artisan)  
Will add coffee-themed cable from JustCables to complete the look

I am looking to get rid of this as a complete bundle, primarily due to the fact that I do not have access to desolder the board. The CA66 is truly flawless (I bought and sold two CA66 boards prior to getting this one to ensure there were no cosmetic defects). Everything works perfectly. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or requests for additional photos. 

Additionally, I'm looking to trade duplicate ETF Dental Plans I have for color swaps, as well as any artisan to the right of the Al Bumen in the timestamp. Again, primarily looking for Dental Plans and Al Bumens, and I'm happy to trade n:1 or provide PayPal in addition. Duplicate Dental Plan colorways are listed below:

Slyzard Echo - prefer trade for other Echo colorway  
Harpy Echo - prefer trade for other Echo colorway  
Holographic Memory - Turquoise and Silver  
Lepidopterist  
Spiked Lemonade

As a final note, I am prioritizing the Dental Plan and Al Bumen trades for the CA66, but will also sell outright for $1,000 + shipping. This will not be FCFS and please do not hesitate to reach out with other offers. Sorry for the long post! Thank you!"

A bundle to make your cyberpunk themed dream setup. Paid EU VAT and other customs fees for all items. I really like laser colorway and planned to make themed setup with this bundle, but I am saving money for other things, so selling it. Prioritizing eu citizens as VAT is already paid and dandy but can send to usa using premium shipping (it is expensive but people loves this shipping)|

In the future I may offer lube or soldering services, but I still need 6 (on officialy 2) trades to go :)

The listed items is easily reachable and I can photoshoot them every two weeks. However I have more items (switches, pcbs, keyboard cases), which is too much work to photoshoot (it is really annoying to do that every two weeks), but you can ask me more options and I may list more items.

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-60 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct. You can write to me with a similar price I offer, however if this is not my offering price, there is much lower chance I will sell item right away or at all. Especially if price is fixed
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay, but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, ask :)*"

Selling a Exclusive E8.5 F13 TKL with E-Black coating (not anode) which gives it a smoother finish. It has a Silver PVD Accent, E-black weight, and will come with a matching Black/Silver Fugu artisan. I don't have the gasket add on, so this will be top-mount.

**Unfortunately there is some damage to the board. I made the mistake of trying to fix a popped stab with tweezers and ended up scratching some of the E-Black coating. Part of the top piece was nicked and the black aluminum plate has some e-black coating scratched off.**

Neither effects the feel or functionality at all. I was able to cover up most of the damage using a mix of black pen and black sharpie to the point where it is unnoticeable unless you are looking for it.

I did my best to document everything, please refer to the photo albums:[Top case damage](https://imgur.com/a/uRkTGQk)

I just finished building my custom Think6.5v2 (so stoked, I'll share pictures of my build in mechkeebs and across discord once I have the final pieces for it) and throughout the process I have switched my build multiple times. Therefore, I have a full build of leftover pieces that I'm willing to sell at cost.

Please note that **I am not a reseller**, I am just trying to cover my original cost which is slightly more expensive than other asking prices for the Think6.5v2 because of the custom color way. I had to purchase multiple items including a Think6.5v2 PC from China in order to make this specific build happen. All items are BNIB, I opened the RAMA artisans to test on my build but ended up going with a few other artisans instead.

Everything is in **mint condition** and the PC and White cases have absolutely no flaws. The Think6.5v2 will come with all of its original items including the PCB, foam, and silicon dampener along with the original toolkit items. I will also include a few extra leftover pieces from my build including a switch puller, 6.5U stab (lubed with 205g0), lube brush, and Tribosys 3203 lube.

As of right now, I'm willing to sell these bundled because it's easier to ship for me and I also really want to see someone do this build. If no one wants to buy the bundle, I'm willing to sell these items separately later this week. So please upvote the post and keep tabs on it if you are interested in just select items instead of the full bundle. There will be a final set of Think6.5v2's shipping so you will see other boards for a slightly lower price point, but it will be very very rare to see this specific combination of PC 2U Top and Snow White aluminum bottom as it requires multiple boards to create this color way.

\**Disclaimer - For anyone curious about the pricing, I'm honestly just covering cost after tax and shipping fees for all of this stuff. For all of these items listed above, I had to place orders from about 5-6 different vendors and resources because items were out of stock or not available CONUS. There were $8-$12 shipping fees for a lot of these orders and for full transparency, I am not even breaking even if all items get sold, still losing about $85-$100.*

Bought this set from a friend but turns out I think I'd prefer SA profile.  I have bought a set of SA Laser with a GMMK Pro from somebody else which had the full sets.  

These have been barely used; I have used a handful of keys (I believe these are the arrow keys) to compare profiles of keycaps and otherwise the box has only been open to fit everything back in after shipping and to inspect contents.

Selling as a set. Sad to see this one go as it was my very first GB I joined. The alphas have some minimal shine on them but overall the set is in great condition. This set will look right at home on any board.

Comment before PM.

# Keyboards

**RAMA M65-B ICED Hotswap (unbuilt)**

Taken out of package to check for machining marks. As most (all?) of the polycarbonate M65-Bs, this one has evenly spaced machining marks on the inside of the case. See https://imgur.com/a/TEYFE1t. Outside it's completely smooth and I don't think you can see the marks once the PCB is in.

Included:

* Full package as listed at https://ramaworks.store/products/m65-b
* 1x extra Polycarbonate plate
* 1x Internal dampener 

Price: $880

**Prime_Elise (Rose gold, hotswap)**

Can't get used to 40%. Comes with Brass plate and extra PCB. One of the PCBs is millmaxed (-> hotswappable). Looks really nice. (Note: this does _not_ come with the keycaps in the timestamp picture)
Also comes with wood wrist rest (Cherry). 

Price: $420

**Feng's Smart 68 V1 Silver/Red (used) (not to be confused with Magicforce 68 Smart)**

[Geekhack thread](https://web.archive.org/web/20180703134842/https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=83442.0). One of the first custom keyboards that came with hotswap sockets. I am selling a Silver V1 (low profile) with a red plate. Layout B (which is rather unconventional). 

It's actually quite a nice low-profile board. Almost not bezel to it. Here a [few photos with SA keycaps](https://imgur.com/a/p3Nmm) but it also looks quite good with GMK. Stabs need to be relubed.

Price: $120

Hey guys, 

Just trying to sell off my R2 Laser Kits and the GMMK Pro. Hopefully pick up some GMK Terra kits as well. I’m open to lower offers than asking would likely take a lower price if we've talked/traded frequently in the past or can meet local (95117). Listed prices for anything on sale include Paypal fees and USPS shipping within the US. 

Will prioritize: Trades > Bundle Sales > Individual Kits 

May sit on offers for a little bit as I really do NOT want to ship out every Laser kit by itself lol. Definitely looking for bundle sales of trades toward GMK Terra. I'll be more likely to split kits off if every kit is claimed/separated into smaller bundles possibly. 

Have | Details | Want

Thanks for readin'

**Edit: Adjusted some prices down more to account for Drop releasing extras on May 3. No changes on the bundle price discount as that's very close to GB cost.**"

|Think6.5 V1 Frosted Poly Hotswap|Has GMK retooled stabs (may want to swap or retune, not my best job). Flashed with VIA. Used pretty lightly for a few months. Includes regular brass badge and polycarbonate badge (from giveaway). One thing to note is that the PCB USB-C connection isn't perfect. Moving the board will sometimes lead to the board reconnecting, which can be of an annoyance. I feel like people might be wary of purchasing because of the issue, however, it is a pretty rare occurrence; [here's an example of it happening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9uZ7N-7Obg).

Does not include stock controller. Also comes with the stock non-accent esc/ctrl keys. One of my favorite boards, but unfortunately it hasn't been used recently. Added bump-ons, has 3d printed usb port covers. One note, some of the screw housings for the pcb screws have been stripped (3-4). The screws go in, but don't tighten all the way. This doesn't affect the experience, but the board isn't perfect! [Sound test](https://soundcloud.com/junhyukee/hhkb)|$200 shipped OBO|

Looking to offload a few items that don't see much use:

Item | What's included| Asking

[KFE Round 1 + Extras](https://imgur.com/a/tIS0TCd)| Silver KFE from r1 (weights are located inside case, not on the bottom, and the connection is Mini USB). Fantastic board, currently built on a PC plate with some of the smoothest retooled blacks I've ever used. Comes with an additional unbuilt h88, POM plate, and a mill-maxed h88 PCB. The mill-maxed h88 was a defect pcb so the caps lock is off-center. It was gold mill-maxed to use as a tester pcb before soldering anything. I have a switch that'll make the standard caps key fit but it doesn't solder in. That maxes are soldered for both the ANSI and ISO layouts though. Please pay attention to some minute cosmetic blemishes on the board as seen in the album. Keycaps sold separately. | $810 Shipped|

This has been replaced with an extra keycap from a tulip add-on kit. CRP r2.2 kits do not support WKL layout without an add-on WKL kit. Used lightly for 3-4 weeks. | $180 shipped

Bullet case is from the group buy maybe 3-4 years ago and never assembled. It comes with a Rev.4 Planck PCB but I would imagine newer revisions of the PCB would be fully compatible. Keysets are all brand new – never used or even mounted.

Prices include PayPal fees and domestic shipping via USPS Priority Mail. International shipping will be extra and I’ll have a preference for US buyers.

|Keycult No. 1/65|$2400|Bought this from someone on this subreddit, without the plates + extra PCB. Has never been built before. Black/brass, A-stock, unbuilt. Includes 2 PCBs + brass plate (not pictured), as well as 2 red alu plates, 1 PC full plate, 1 PC half plate. **UPDATE:** *Please note that I have a trade offer for this board that I'm interested in taking. In the case that the trade does not go through, I will be selling to those in my PMs in the order that I was messaged in since there are already a few buyers that willing to pay my asking price.*|[https://imgur.com/a/1ZrTxTT](https://imgur.com/a/1ZrTxTT)|
|Bauer R1|$2000|This was originally an A-stock board configured as a silver top, grey plate, grey aluminum base. I had it cerakoted to be all black, including the alu plate it is currently built with. There is one surface-level mark visible on the right side of the board. It is not a dent. Currently built with a millmaxed PCB + **Gateron Ink V1s** lubed with 205g0, filmed with TX films (by AshKeebs), and Zeal screw-in stabs. The kit includes 1 additional PCB and a PC plate.|[https://imgur.com/a/1n1cYow](https://imgur.com/a/1n1cYow)|

Letting go of this board today. Types really nice but it definitely doesn't get enough use out of me and won't get much with the boards I have coming.

Hello! 

Putting up a post to sell my Classy TKL first proto that I purchased from DoctorNunu himself. (Same unit shown on the IC page for the Classy)

There are a few differences between the production unit. One difference is the edge height, the top for the proto had a little miscalculation which caused it to be a tiny bit too low, nothing I've really paid attention to during use, as well as the weight which is not shiny pvd.

The ""Ä"" key has some scuffs, although it is not noticeable during use.

For the Classy TKL I'd prefer a trade for some other nice board, otherwise €500 *OBO*

GMK Laser all kits - €270 + ship
