Hello all,

I’m have too many keyboards! Please buy some 😃

**SOLD** \* GMK Metropolis Base, Midnight, Signs, Blocks. 
I’m going to regret selling this, but here it is. Selling for $400 shipped via PayPal G&S for USPS shipping within the US. The box is pretty dinged up but the keycaps are in good shape and I can take off $10 if you want it shipped in bags only. 
Metropolis is supposed to run again later this year, so please understand you’re just skipping the wait by buying this original set.

**SOLD**\* Frosted Acrylic Lubrigante in Wonderland built with Zilent 78g switches. There are minor imperfections in the acrylic as depicted. It is a fantastic first Alice board and this is perfect for anyone who wants to try the layout with awesome switches without soldering. You just need keycaps and a USB-C cable to get going. I can include the Tai-Hao keycaps on the board but it really needs a different set with spacebars for an Alice layout. Asking $240 shipped via PayPal G&S for USPS shipping within the US, more if shipped elsewhere, $210 for local pickup for local Oʻahu residents only. Keycaps are $20 extra.

**SOLD** \* Alternative-Cased Shiny Clear top/Silver Metal Plate /Black Mid/Pink Bottom Mysterium built with Boba U4’s. If you want the quietest mechanical with maximum keys and a close to standard layout. this is just about it. I love the Boba feel almost as much as Zilents, and they’re even quieter than Zilents. The cutout for USB-C on this board is ridiculously small. I can include a basic Apple white C-C cable that fits the cutout for $10 extra. Asking $230 shipped via PayPal G&S for USPS shipping within the US, more if shipped elsewhere, $200 for local pickup for local Oʻahu residents only.

I’ll take off $50 if anyone is wild enough to buy both keyboards. Just reply to this thread and send me a PM if you’re interested (please, no reddit chat!) 🙂","[US-HI] [H] Metropolis (Base, Midnight, Signs, Blocks), Frosted Alice-Style Lubrigante in Wonderland, Black Mysterium [W] PayPal"

Hey everyone. Looking to trade/sell my GMK Mizu bundle today.

It includes GMK Mizu base kit, spacebars, novelties, and the tulia deskmat.  Everything is used for about a month but typed on lightly. I cannot see any shine, even with harsh lighting. More pics can be provided but i tried to get some with harsh lighting in the timestamp. Tulia mat has been used for almost a year straight, so there are a few tiny spots that will probably come out with it being cleaned off. I am looking for $450 shipped OBO or trades for RAMA X and O keycaps. SOLD for 435

I am prioritizing trades for the first couple hours for the specific caps listed below but i will sell it outright if there arent any trade offers by the end of tonight.

The Specific RAMA Caps that i am looking for are:

\-RAMA x GMK Oasis X and O

\-RAMA x GMK Monochrome X and O

\-RAMA x  GMK Chocolatier X and O

The set still looks great, althought there is some slight shine on the spacebar and subtle visible shine on W,A,S,D and shift keys. The Rama you can see in the picture I also bought with a couple of scuffs on the bottom end, but not visible when in a case or mounted. All of the rest of the keycaps other than a basic 65% layout were never touched. .~~ **~~$330 Shipped in box $320 Shipped in bags.~~** **~~Base kit sold for $220.

Hi,

Some time ago now, I bought MT3 Serika Latin Alphas, Modifiers, and Geometries.  When I got them, I put them on a keyboard, used them for a few minutes, and decided that MT3 really wasn't for me.  They've been in a drawer ever since, so I thought I would see if anyone is interested in trading for them.  I'm interested mainly in Cherry profile keycaps, no MT3 (obviously) or SA.  Would mostly prefer GMK, and would be fine with adding some cash if someone is interested in trading a GMK set that is worth more.

As you can see in the photo, I still have the boxes for all three sets, but the boxes are nothing special, since they're just flat boxes and do not separate or organize the keycaps in any way... so I just prefer to  keep all three sets in a bag, since it's more convenient.

Anyway, feel free to make any offers.  Worst thing, I'll just say no.  I have a bunch of nice keysets, though, so I'm looking for something fairly desirable.

Thanks.","[US-MA] [H] MT3 Serika Latin Alphas, Modifiers, Geometries [W] Keyset Trades"

~~[[let's do the time warp]](https://imgur.com/a/LyGk1jo)~~


~~To whom it may concern,~~

~~I'm entertaining the thought of letting go of my decked out Tofu to make room for smaller, less useful keyboards. It's built up with a Tsangan bottom row (1.5-1-1.5-7-1.5-1-1.5), split right shift, and split backspace. There's case foam under the pcb and some more foam that I cut to fill the battery void, there's also strips of foam sandwiched between plate and pcb.~~

~~The entire pcb/plate assembly is isolated from the case by [using some pvc washers](https://i.imgur.com/QbxVZyR.jpg), and the middle two standoffs have been dremeled off. This results in a very contained sound without any metallic reverb on the one hand, [and a decent amount of flex on the other hand.](https://i.imgur.com/PyryaY0.mp4)~~

~~The soldered switches are assembled from cherry housings cherry-picked (ha!) for their smoothness, UHMPWE stems of the modern vintage R1 V3 (lubed with 205), TX springs with a 65g weight (I estimate, forgot which one's exactly I put in; lubed with 105), TX films. No ping or scratch whatsoever, tasty signature Cherry sound, ultra-smooth. It's got C3 stabs from the second round, with improved tolerances to keep warped keys from binding.~~

~~The universal brass plate itself is a bit scuffed and had been cut to accommodate in-line arrow keys in the bottom row by the guy that sold it to me. The pcb is a DZ60 V2, nothing special.~~

~~The case itself is a beautiful Air Force Blue color and looks pristine. It'll all be packed securely in the beat-up but original box the board came in. GMK WoB is not included!!* If you're in the market for a mid-range 60% board then this is pretty much the best a Tofu can sound and feel like.~~

~~#I'm tentatively asking for 180EUR plus shipping but I like a good [OBO](https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/sG2Zu5XCOZfOdF4j88utCy8OR-I=/630x630/top/www.trbimg.com/img-546652c6/turbine/ct-eugene-izotov-cso-oboe-20141113) ngl~~

Getting rid some some less used parts of my collection I have a lightly used R1 Silver Space65 with a black badge and extra PCB. GMK Stabilizers installed as well as Mill-max sockets in current PCB, so it is hot swappable. One of the sockets got ripped out, so I installed a jumper [seen here, between keys 3 and 4](http://imgur.com/gallery/TeqFDEU). It works perfectly, and there is an unused PCB as well if you need. \[$550\]

I am selling my HHKB Blank Black Classic. It has been lubed and silenced with KBD Fans Silencing rings. It will come with the original box as well. It has barely been used and it has maybe 1 hour of use with the silencing rings on it. **$175 + shipping**

I am selling my SM keyboards TKL. It is transparent purple and teal with a copper plate. It has a Hineybush 87a PCB and is finished off with Kailh Box Blacks. It has GMK stabilizers, but keep in mind the spacebar stabilizer should probably be replaced. It works fine but it a bit sluggish and quite noisy currently. the tabs holding the bar in place broke so I had to replace them with a dab of hot glue as pictured. A new stabilizer would fix this issue. In addition I am including a set of Hyperfuse origins with all the extra caps as well. If you have any questions feel free to ask. I am negotiable on the price. **$490 + shipping**. 

I am selling my HHKB Pro 2 Type S. It has been custom painted iridescent electric blue with a satin finish. There are some blemishes on the front of the board as well as the back which I did take pictures of. The bottom of the board did collect some dust when painting so just keep in mind that it is not a perfect paintjob. Also in the last photo of the album you will see that I masked off each of the slider housings so as not to get any overspray in them. The paintjob did not effect performance at all, and I took great care when masking to make sure that it would perform as normal. Included is a set of blank black caps minus the Fn and Esc key which are red and blue as shown. If you have any questions, let me know. The board has also been lubed and used the factory silencing rings. ~~$170 + Shipping~~ **SOLD**

I am selling a TKL resin wrist rest I just made. It has not been used, only posed for photos on my instagram. There are some minor blemishes on the top that are only visible if you look very close in the right lighting. The bottom edges of the rest have been sanded but it is not visible at all when it is on your desk. It is a white pearl with subtle black swirl. ~~$35 + Shipping~~ **SOLD**

I am selling my White POM Iris Rev 4. It was built and used for less than 10 hours, and was just disassembled using a HAKKO FR301. The layout just isn't for me. The only ""defects"" worth noting is that I did need to make some cuts on the bottom plate to make the pcb fit properly (See pics for details) but keep in mind it comes with two brand new plates if you would prefer to make the cuts yourself, it also has some scratches on the top plate from removing the switches, but they aren't anything major. It comes with a bunch of extra parts as pictured (You could almost build another case with all the extra layers) as well as the stabilizers on the pcb. **$125 + Shipping or Trades**

I am selling a **Candybar Premium Space Gray A Stock** I got from the round 2 extras. Used for less than an hour, I wanted to try 40%... I have **Righty PCB & Righty Space Gray Plate.** Currently mounted Light Green Tangerines filmed and lubed with krytox 205g0. GMK screw-in stabs lubed with krytox 205g2 (buyer would get the rest of the set). The switches were just mounted for pictures but are optional. I also have a **Lefty PCB & Plate** that I would prefer to sell as a bundle for anyone who would want to have to builds or try both layouts.

Candybar with both layouts' plates and pcbs and gmk stabs **$475**, if you want the tangerines it'll be an additional $40.

* Two disclaimers:
   * Both included plates do not work with stepped caps lock well because the switch cutout stops short a little bit. If you would like to use stepped caps lock you need to file the plates slightly. Alternatively, you can just use a different plate.
   * The typing angle (4 degrees) is pretty low. According to some people, this is fantastic and better than a higher angle. For me, I've decided that it is not. I have done some testing with other low angle boards over the past couple weeks and decided I like the higher angle. It comes down to personal preference, but I thought it was worth mentioning.

CONUS only

I am selling my Kbd8x fully built as is for **~~$400 shipped~~** **-- SOLD**

Condition is like new. Selling to make room for other acquisitions, and I find that 67g is just perhaps a tad too stiff for my liking. This is a full bundle in one box. I am not interested in breaking this out into invidual parts.

The only thing I am open to possibly trading for is an unmodded white Leopold FC980C 45g + cash to make up the difference.

Includes:

* Kbd8x MkII Black
   * Built with brass plate
   * C3 Kiwi switches
      * Krytox 205g2+105: bottom housing and stem
      * Krytox 105: springs
      * TX film
   * Durok Screw-In Stabilizers
      * Clear
      * Krytox 205g0
* KbdFans 80% carrying case
* GMK WoB base kit from Drop
   * Keycaps will come on board.
   * Extra keycaps will be in a ziplock bag
   * Including the crappy tray it came with, because people like to collect them apparently
* Original box and packaging for the Kbd8x","[US-TN][H] Fully built Kbd8x MkII Black with Kiwis (lubed & filmed) bundled with carrying case, and GMK WoB [W] PayPal"

Hi all! Been a while since I've posted on here took a break for keebs and looking to offload some items especially since a lot of things I've participated in group buys are gonna be shipping out in a couple of months! So here's what I have for sale today!

1. ~~GMK Hiragana and Spacebar kit! $100 SHIPPED~~ SOLD TO u/iTakakashi

~~Hiragana kit was lightly used, if anything little to no shine at all! BUT one ""defect"" it has two B keys! I used the set like this and did purchase another set from a redditor here but I ended up selling the kit that I was not using to another user. Looking to offload this hiragana kit but please keep it in mind that there are two B keys. For the spacebar kit the only one I used was the 7U spacebar I believe the blueish looking one? Everything else was just sitting there. Pricing is at $100 Shipped, as point of reference I paid $110 for the Hiragana kit and $55 for the spacebar kit!~~

~~SORRY THE REASON FOR TWO B KEYS IS THAT THERE ARE NO ""N"" KEY IT IS MISSING THIS IS HOW I RECEIVED THIS KIT~~

~~2) MILK 2% Macropad $30 SHIPPED~~ SOLD TO u/chromabolt

~~Purchased this from another user saw light use from me will include the keycaps on it and it's build with milky gateron blacks I believe they're lubed? Either way this is a hotswap so you could switch it out. This uses micro usb for the connection type. I originally paid $90 for this.~~

3) Shambles Hotswap built $80 SHIPPED

Built shambles board, purchased it from another user who originally bought off of an Esty shop. Board is milmaxxed with the layout you see. I have a layout flashed on the board but do not have the original file but if anything you'll be able to use QMK to reflash it with whatever you'd like. To do so you'll have to open up the board and short the RST PINS on the PRO Micro I believe is what it is. This uses micro USB for the connection type. I originally paid $90 for this UNBUILT. I am asking the $80 but with lubed milky gateron blacks. Also the back of the board has the protective film on it still I have not removed it also if you want to RST the board you'll need a hex screw a small one as this does not use standard screws to open!

~~4) BOB GENGAR KEYCAPS BUNDLE $100 SHIPPED~~

~~Pretty self explanatory these are BOB Gengar keycaps selling at what I believe to be a great price! These are the ""blind"" boxes that he offered in August of last year. I apologize I do not have the original cards that came with these but I can offer to show you the invoice that BOB sends when invoicing. And my apologies but no I will not split these up.~~

Everything I have for sale is shipped VIA USPS Priority Mail. My prices are what I want for the item I will cover shipping costs. So because of that this is only for CONUS!

Getting rid of some stuff to pay my way to GMK Awaken. Let's get to it. I hate doing this, and I haven't really been keeping up with the market, so these prices might be a bit off. **CONUS ONLY. Also, I will bundle the hell out of stuff, if you're interested. I'll respond to all communications tomorrow morning (Friday 1/29).**

1. ANSI 60% w/67g Zealios in a Beige Keyboard Belle case - Not my best build, honestly. It works fine and everything, but I kind of forgot about stabs until I went to build. Been using a Costar stab on the spacebar. Nice case, though. **Asking $100 shipped**, since I like the case so much.
2. Tada 68 w/Mod-M switches - Underrated switch, in my opinion. Black plastic case. Think I still have the caps, but I'll have to dig to make sure. Priced as if I don't have them, but if I find them, you'll get them. **Asking $70 shipped.**
3. Tina-C Case, Silver - Turns out, I hate HHKB and silver. **$70 Shipped**
4. ANSI 60% w/Box Pinks (CLICKY) w/Badass Gold/Clear Lustro case - This build is great, if I do say so myself. Nice everything. Got that fancy underlighting, if that floats your boat. This case is stunning, too. One of the coolest I've seen. **Asking $225 Shipped**
5. PBT Vaporwave - Nice set, used moderately. Looks great, though. Lettering messes with my color blindness, so what's the point? **$100 Shipped**
6. Lambo 60% Silver - Fucking tired of silver. **$55 shipped**
7. ?PBT Chalk? - Some set I don't know the name of purchased off of here. Colors didn't look like I thought they would. Never used by me. Probably used before me. **$30 Shipped**
8. Kacha Keys Hyperfloof and some red swirl keys with gold leaf - Hot take: all artisans are lame. **Spend over $100 bucks, I'll toss these in for free. Just ask.**
9. ISO brass plate - I didn't mean to buy ISO, so here we are. **$40 Shipped (I have no clue)**.
10. QMX Silencing Clips - First group buy, on Massdrop, nonetheless. Thought I'd want them at some point. I was flushed with the excitement of getting into a new hobby, so I bought a bunch of stuff I never used. **$25 Shipped, or you can just ask for them if you spend $100. Please take them.**

Well, this went real off the rails. I don't really want to trade, but if you have something cool, I'll take a look, probably. NO ARTISANS, if what I said up top wasn't enough of an indication.","[US-AL][H] Keyboards, Keycaps, Cases, and A Couple Artisans [W] Paypal"

Looking to trade an old keycap set of mine. Used it for around a month, then switched to a different keycap set. Still in great condition, practically no wear and tear. The only knock on it is that the spacebars are a little warped (I got the set when I was first getting into the Keyboard community and didn't know how to fix the issue). 


I'm really just looking for a cherry profile keycap set that will look particularly good with a black and/or dark blue board (grays and darker color bases are nice). Really looking at PBT for the material, but I'm open to ABS as well. Would love a spacebar kit as well, but it's not necessary. As always, please comment when you pm!

KBD8X MKII: Rose gold. HAS WINKEY. Just includes the base case + brass plate + pcb (never soldered). I only opened to check colors. PCB is untested but I'm happy to test it. Does not have the foam that most people ordered so you'd have to source that yourself if you wanted it. Perfect condition as far as I can tell.  $350

GMMK fullsize: I don't think it has the standard arrow keys because they are grey and look kind of odd but this is how it was sold to me. I believe one key isn't working (maybe the right winkey or alt or something. Wasn't an issue for me when I used it. If someone's interested I'll test it). Wouldn't come with any switches. $45

Pok3r 2 (or is it 3) it's the later version with rgb: Red switches. Stabs are quite noisy but that's par for the course with these things. Bought it used and used for a couple months at school.

Mainly looking to trade for a Vega in black/grey/e-white with a hotswap PCB, Aperture Norbaforce MKII or $800 SHIPPED.

I really want a Vega or Aperture Norbaforce so thats why I'd prob prefer to do a straight trade lol.

The board is cerakoted white and I will provide more pictures upon request however, the board is essentially flawless.

Comes with 2 builds - currently installed is an fr4 snow pro combo built with lubed and filmed retooled blacks with sprit 63.5 progressive springs. GMK lubed stabs. All LEDs work on the SnoPro PCB. The second build is Stainless Steel plate on stock PCB with lubed mint holy pandas. Durock lubed stabs. Did not get to finish soldering LED on this board as I did not purchase them.

**59 Durock Linears:** These used to be Silent Durock Linears but I harvested the dampeners so now they're just regular linears. Smokey housings and 67g springs. Lubed with 205g0 and GPL 105 on the springs. Filmed with black Deskeys films. I'm not sure how to price these since I pillaged the dampeners, so asking ~~**$30 shipped.**~~ Sold $30 shipped.

**Keyreative Blank Keycaps:** From TKC, blank ABS. Have a white set and a black set. Both unused. Asking **$30 shipped each.** (I believe these are in stock at TKC for $24 + $10ish shipping).

Hello, I have a few things to sell. I was inspired by TaeKeyboards for his custom ducky board and was going to make it a little project but ended up not cuz I started working in the emergency department sad :( Hope someone can make good use out of it.

Ducky one 2 Mecha Mini: Gateron milky yellow switches (Krytox 205g0 and 105 on springs). GMK plate mount stabs (lubed with 205g0 and dielectric grease, can throw in the OG ducky stab if you want). Used Sorbothane and O-rings to dampen the sound and feel. Come with the OG box and accessories. **TRADED FOR SWITCHES**

Hi MM,

Looking to sell this board I'm no longer using. Selling price is less than what I paid for it.

1\] XENO silver 75% -> $500 shipped CONUS OBO

\- Flawless case / rose gold PVD weight. To my eyes, there are no external flaws to the case. Pictures have been added to the album for you to confirm.

\- I had a copper plate cut for it to match the rose gold weight which is included in the price. Comes with the wilba PCB (QMK/VIA) and the original box.

Trades I'm looking for:

CRP Xerox

Prophet HHKB (Not E-white)

GMK Botanical

Keyboard will be desoldered with a FR-301 and PCBs cleaned and tested afterwards. I prefer split backspace on everything which is not the norm. However, I can keep it soldered if you want. Just want to let this board go to someone who'll use it so feel free to offer.

I really don't want to sell this, but I haven't been able to show this keyboard the love it deserves, and think someone else would be able to enjoy this board more than I am right now. I have tried so many switches in this board and finalized with tealios v2. This board sounds amazing and the bouncy feeling of the pom plate is really nice to type on.

Hello all,

I’m have too many keyboards! Please buy some 😃

\* GMK Metropolis Base, Midnight, Signs, Blocks. 
I’m going to regret selling this, but here it is. Selling for $400 shipped via PayPal G&S for USPS shipping within the US. The box is pretty dinged up but the keycaps are in good shape and I can take off $10 if you want it shipped in bags only. 
Metropolis is supposed to run again later this year, so please understand you’re just skipping the wait by buying this original set.

\* Frosted Acrylic Lubrigante in Wonderland built with Zilent 78g switches. There are minor imperfections in the acrylic as depicted. It is a fantastic first Alice board and this is perfect for anyone who wants to try the layout with awesome switches without soldering. You just need keycaps and a USB-C cable to get going. I can include the Tai-Hao keycaps on the board but it really needs a different set with spacebars for an Alice layout. Asking $240 shipped via PayPal G&S for USPS shipping within the US, more if shipped elsewhere, $210 for local pickup for local Oʻahu residents only. Keycaps are $20 extra.

\* Alternative-Cased Shiny Clear top/Silver Metal Plate /Black Mid/Pink Bottom Mysterium built with Boba U4’s. If you want the quietest mechanical with maximum keys and a close to standard layout. this is just about it. I love the Boba feel almost as much as Zilents, and they’re even quieter than Zilents. The cutout for USB-C on this board is ridiculously small. I can include a basic Apple white C-C cable that fits the cutout for $10 extra. Asking $230 shipped via PayPal G&S for USPS shipping within the US, more if shipped elsewhere, $200 for local pickup for local Oʻahu residents only.

I’ll take off $50 if anyone is wild enough to buy both keyboards. Just reply to this thread and send me a PM if you’re interested (please, no reddit chat!) 🙂","[US-HI] [H] Metropolis (Base, Midnight, Signs, Blocks), Frosted Alice-Style Lubrigante in Wonderland, Black Mysterium [W] PayPal"

~~[[Time Tombs](https://imgur.com/a/LcpbS2S)]~~

~~To whom it may concern,~~

~~I'm entertaining the thought of letting go of my decked out Tofu to make room for smaller, less useful keyboards. It's built up with a Tsangan bottom row (1.5-1-1.5-7-1.5-1-1.5), split right shift, and split backspace. There's case foam under the pcb and some more foam that I cut to fill the battery void, there's also strips of foam sandwiched between plate and pcb.~~

~~The entire pcb/plate assembly is [isolated from the case by using some pvc washers](https://i.imgur.com/QbxVZyR.jpg), and the middle two standoffs have been dremeled off. This results in a very contained sound  without any metallic reverb on the one hand, [and a decent amount of flex on the other hand.](https://i.imgur.com/PyryaY0.mp4)~~

~~The soldered switches are assembled from cherry housings cherry-picked (ha!) for their smoothness, UHMPWE stems of the modern vintage R1 V3 (lubed with 205), TX springs with a 65g weight (I estimate, forgot which one's exactly I put in; lubed with 105), TX films. No ping or scratch whatsoever, tasty signature Cherry sound, ultra-smooth. It's got C3 stabs from the second round, with improved tolerances to keep warped keys from binding.~~

~~The universal brass plate itself is a bit scuffed and had been cut to accommodate in-line arrow keys in the bottom row by the guy that sold it to me. The pcb is a DZ60 V2, nothing special.~~

~~The case itself is a beautiful Air Force Blue color and looks pristine. It'll all be packed securely in the beat-up but original box the board came in. *GMK WoB is not included!!** If you're in the market for a mid-range 60% board then this is pretty much the best a Tofu can sound and feel like.~~

~~###I'm tentatively asking for 180EUR plus shipping. I'd rather keep it EU-local, but am happy to try and figure out international shipping with you.~~

Hi all,

Selling my first GMK set, GMK DUALSHOT and the accompanying deskmat. I would prefer to sell them together if possible, but can sell them separate if needed. Recently became unemployed and I am now in need of parting ways with items around the house that are non-essential. The set arrived to me on Sept. 26th of 2020 and were mounted to my 60% board just until tonight when I removed them for the pictures. The WASD keys and the 6.25u spacebar have medium shine to them from daily use. The deskmat was recently washed and hung dried per Dixiemech instructions.

I bought this keyboard from mechmarket several months ago. It is by far one of my favorites that I have ever owned however, I recently received several others and feel it's time to move on. It has durock stabs and I have mounted 2 different sets of switches into it. There is almost no blemishes on the white part of the case but the mirror finished back-weight does have some scratches. There are pictures of the whole keyboard from every angle and close ups in the timestamp. I have an extra silicone dampener and it already has one included. I also have ALL of the original packaging. I paid $1400 opened, but unassembled.

What's up everyone!

Long post warning, sorry in advance!

It's time for my Fiancée and I to look for a house we want to buy; unfortunately the down payment alone is between €50,000 and €65,000 so though choices had to be made. I am getting rid of almost everything I own trying to raise funds for this. Thank you so much for your time and I hope you'll find something you like in all this!

##[Please Read]

> ❧ This will not be FCFS, I will go like this: **Friends** > **Bundles** > **Sales/Trades** (I'm allowing myself to keep a carbon build at home and a work board, so I'll stick to carbon artisans and nothing else).

> ❧ **TO ALL US CITIZENS**: it looks like the states have issued some sort of order to (all other countries?) Belgium saying they will no longer accept regular, expedited, mail (read, the usual shipping method I use). All shipping for artisans which usually cost $15 to ship went up to the price of a box (method I use for keysets/keyboards) and thus cost the same, $40. I will try and pitch in when I can so don't let this discourage you, but again, that makes Bundles easier for me.

##[Want]

Except for PayPal, I am really only looking for a handful of things for the two boards I'll be keeping

###Artisans

Only looking for Carbon artisans, and not that many. [Here is a list of the ones I could be interested in](https://i.imgur.com/vZa9a0j.jpg), but I'm not after all of them of course, only need a couple for my board (gamer sets are my priority in here).

###Keysets

Looking for:
  
* GMK Carbon (with Novelties)
* GMK Skiidata

&nbsp;

That's it :) 

&nbsp;

/!\ Please comment before or after PMing - helps me keep track of PMs and of whom I answered to /!\

PM (no chat) here or on Discord (JSaintS#3904) :)

One last thing: I'm not leaving the hobby, I am just stopping to collect artisans (at least for now) and am getting rid of most of what I own to reallocate the funds to my house hunting. I **will not** abandon my ongoing projects (and new ones) and will stay active on my and other discords :)

Take care everyone! <3

~~Black Aluminum NK65; From the original release from last year, was my daily driver until I got something different. Some small knicks and scratches are as seen in the photos, but I am happy to provide more upon request. The stabilizers are modded. There is one screw that is stripped and difficult to remove, it connects the plate to the pcb. There are o-rings on the standoffs. I had previously sold this not long ago but the buyer ended up returning the board to me (with the o-rings). They did not like that the board was tray-mount and did not seem to be aware of that before purchasing it from me.

Hi MM,

Looking to sell this board I'm no longer using. Selling price is less than what I paid for it.

1\] XENO silver 75% -> $500 shipped CONUS OBO

\- Flawless case / rose gold PVD weight. To my eyes, there are no external flaws to the case. Pictures have been added to the album for you to confirm.

\- I had a copper plate cut for it to match the rose gold weight which is included in the price. Comes with the wilba PCB (QMK/VIA) and the original box.

Trades I'm looking for:

CRP Xerox

Prophet HHKB (Not E-white)

GMK Botanical

Keyboard will be desoldered with a FR-301 and PCBs cleaned and tested afterwards. I prefer split backspace on everything which is not the norm. However, I can keep it soldered if you want. Just want to let this board go to someone who'll use it so feel free to offer.

Please comment here before PMing me.

**KEYBOARDS:**

**~~(Hot-Swap) Black Tokyo60: $100 + shipping~~** **SOLD FOR ASKING**

~~Great board! Only thing is that it is missing two frame screws on the back (I bought it like that). I was too lazy to purchase some replacements but it has never been an issue. The stabs were the included stabs and were clipped, lubed, and band-aid modded by the previous owner.~~

**~~(Hot-Swap) Silver iGK61 Build: $100 + shipping~~** **SOLD**

~~This was my first board ever. It is a mass-produced keeb I got off of ePathBuy. It is a good entry board and has served me well. This build includes Kailh Pro Purple Switches and Ducky Skyline keycaps. I don’t want to split this and would rather sell it as a package. Stabs are the included stock ones. I clipped and lubed them.~~

 **~~(Hot-Swap) Black Alu NK65 v1: $150 + shipping~~** **SOLD FOR ASKING**

~~I was able to snag my dream 65% so I don’t need this one anymore. It is another great board, and I don’t think there are too much differences between this and the current versions. I can’t remember but I think the stabs are the stock included ones. Comes with the included case.~~

**~~Acrylic Alice Build: $200 + shipping~~** SOLD FOR ASKING

~~Only selling this because I just can’t get used to the layout. Other than that it is a great board. The case is from u/AKnyang and it has the Adelais en. Ciel PCB. Previous owner built it with Milky Top Gat Yellows. Not sure what kind of stabs, I never asked. It is mini-USB.~~

**~~Frosted Acrylic Tofu60: $175 + shipping~~** **SOLD**

~~Previous owner built it with lubed Gat Ink Blacks (escape key has a cream stem). It has an alu plate with the DZ60 RGB Rev3 PCB. Not sure about the stabs. Only thing is, I was flashing it in QMK to re-map the RGB control buttons and now the RGB is only set at a really dim level and I can’t figure out how to get it brighter. I really suck at QMK so maybe a more proficient user can figure it out.~~

**~~(Hot-Swap) YMDK96: $95 + shipping~~** SOLD FOR ASKING

~~Bought this off of AliExpress. Really loving TKL right now so don't need this anymore. It is a great entry board and is cool because it has all the keys you will need (if you can’t commit to smaller boards). Stabs were the included ones; not modded.~~

**KEYCAPS:**

**~~Drop + Redsuns GMK Red Samurai: $60 shipped~~** SOLD FOR ASKING

~~This is the 65% set. Not too much shine. I bought the 1800 layout set so I don’t need these anymore.~~

**~~Infinikey Sanctuary + Rebirth: $160 shipped~~** SOLD FOR ASKING

~~I bought these when they dropped the extras. I only mounted them once and used for a few days. The theme just doesn’t fit any of my current boards.~~

**SWITCHES:**

**~~x59 Tealios v2: $55 shipped~~** SOLD FOR ASKING

Hello everyone!

I am unfortunately having to let go of my most prized set due to an unforeseen expense with my car :( I was waiting to use it on the eventual Sat75 R2 but it looks like that will not happen. To be clear, there will be a round 2 of this set running next month but if you want it now and would like to help me cover some expenses I would be super thankful. These are all brand new, never opened... I was hoping the big day would be when the board arrived but life happens.

I would prefer to sell the whole thing as a bundle but am willing to let the deskmats go separately if you must have them.

[~~Sound Test 2~~](https://youtu.be/fPlzCxafxX4) ~~(youtube)~~

\*Sound tests aren't the best quality as it was recorded with a Go Pro Hero 9 and the microphone is quite sensitive and loud. So it's not 100% accurate. so take it for what it is.\*The 2nd sound test sounds scratchy because it's my fingernail on the keycaps not the switches themselves. In person they are quite quiet, enough to use in an office environment.

First post so feel free to throw tomatoes at me if I did anything wrong especially with pricing. Just wanted to sell these two builds I did because I want to fund my end-game keyboard ( really hope this is the one ) and I am a broke college kid who shouldn't be spending money on this anyway. :)

**~~ZealPC Zilents v2 67g x110 ($95):~~**~~- These are also brand new in box and never opened still with the shipping label. I never used these because I read about the U4s as seen below, but these were already shipped out and I can't return them per Zeal policy. So here they are for a slight discount.~~

**~~Tofu96 Tactile Build: (asking $250)~~**

~~- Black; No Damage or Outstanding Flaws ( can send more detailed pics if requested)- Gazzew U4 Bobas from Ashkeebs- Tribosys 3203 (lightly lubed as I believe they are lubed from factory)- Stock Springs Krytox GPL 105- ZealPC Screw-In Stabilizers Krytox 205g0- Brass Plate- Has a stepped caps lock key; can resolder to standard caps if requested\*Pretty quiet which I like but I strongly prefer linear keyboards and I don't care for silence anymore. Significantly better than Zilents imo and as a bonus I might throw in some free pack of 10 Zealios if this gets sold. keycaps not included.~~

Also I didn't have enough switches so one of them is a U4 boba switch. Feel free to trash the roselios or re-tweak them or use them for something else. I did not like it because it was a bit scratchy and I expected a dead silent keyboard.

Long post warning, sorry in advance!

It's time for my Fiancée and I to look for a house we want to buy; unfortunately the down payment alone is between €50,000 and €65,000 so though choices had to be made. I am getting rid of almost everything I own trying to raise funds for this. Thank you so much for your time and I hope you'll find something you like in all this!

##[Want]

Except for PayPal, I am really only looking for a handful of things for the two boards I'll be keeping

###Artisans

Only looking for Carbon artisans, and not that many. [Here is a list of the ones I could be interested in](https://i.imgur.com/vZa9a0j.jpg), but I'm not after all of them of course, only need a couple for my board (gamer sets are my priority in here).

###Keysets

Looking for:
  
* GMK Carbon (with Novelties)
* GMK Skiidata

&nbsp;

That's it :) 

&nbsp;

/!\ Please comment before or after PMing - helps me keep track of PMs and of whom I answered to /!\

PM (no chat) here or on Discord (JSaintS#3904) :)

One last thing: I'm not leaving the hobby, I am just stopping to collect artisans (at least for now) and am getting rid of most of what I own to reallocate the funds to my house hunting. I **will not** abandon my ongoing projects (and new ones) and will stay active on my and other discords :)

Take care everyone! <3

~~The board has been built with lubed everglide stabs and red inks that are lightly lubed with 205g0 & spring swapped to 65g tx springs iirc.

Shipping (**US only**): USPS tracked and **insured** flat rate $10 for Keycaps, $5 for deskmat and $20 for Keyboards. Post office near me has very limited COVID hours right now so shipping might not be as snappy as usual but will make as fast as possible.

Keycaps are **untouched** and **sealed** (except for SA Laser which is untouched and unused but in baggies).

**NOT SPLITTING UP SETS** so pm'ing to ask is not going to do anything, sorry but it seems to be near impossible to make this clear. Offers are welcome but not planning to stray too far and not in a rush or anything. Thanks for understanding :).

Please comment before PM'ing and feel free to ask any questions aside from the above very clear rules and sorry only selling not trading.

Apologies if responses are bit slow I am working at the moment but I will get back to you!

A few notes on boards:

**E8.5:** completely unused, received finally recently only removed from original packaging to take pictures. Just didn't end up being my form factor after ordering a long time ago. Package details:

* Layout: WKL
* PCB (2): Solder and Hotswap
* Top Color: E Black
* Bottom Color: E Black
* Plate Color (2): Titanium and E Yellow
* Accent Colors(2): PVD Silver and E Yellow
* Side Weight Colors(2): E Black and E Yellow
* Middle Gasket Mount: Yes
* Inner Middle: E Black

&#x200B;

**Think 6.5 R1:** Polycarb no front badge, comes with extra hotswap pcb and alternate black rear badge. Built but never used, couple of things to note. 4 screws are missing from bottom, the middle 4 as they never came with the order, these can easily be replaced I just have not done so as they don't really effect anything. No issues or blemishes with board and comes soldered with Gateron Inks switch filmed and lubed with 205g0.

**CA66**: this one is really killing me to give up, built and used but only slightly as it never made the daily rotation. Dark grey with gold badge HHKB style with bluetooth including installed almost unused 3.7V 3000mAh 595085 Li-ion Rechargeable Lithium Polymer Li-Po Battery as well as installed Brass plate. Switches are harvested Vintage Blacks, switch filmed and lubed with 205g0. There are a few cosmetic defects only noticeable one is on the back as seen in pictures, as well as a slight one on the front forward face.

Hi! Recently I've moved to 40% ortholinear keyboards with Workman layout so I'm going to sell all other stuff that I don't use anymore.

The prices don't include the shipping, I can ship worldwide, you'll decide the shipping type/company. Please consider that if you chose to ship with Royal Mail I'll need to go to the Post Office and **UK at the moment is in lock-down** so I'll try to wait for more than one shipment before to go to the post office to avoid as many trips as possible.

I live in **South East London** so if you want to pass by to collect it and to pay cash is fine by me.

If you want more/better/different pictures please send me a PM.

**If you buy more than a product we can arrange a discount.**

Comment before PM, thanks.

Hi MM,

Looking to sell this board I'm no longer using. Selling price is less than what I paid for it.

1\] XENO silver 75% -> $550 shipped CONUS OBO

\- Flawless case / rose gold PVD weight. To my eyes, there are no external flaws to the case. Pictures have been added to the album for you to confirm.

\- I had a copper plate cut for it to match the rose gold weight which is included in the price. Comes with the wilba PCB (QMK/VIA) and the original box.

Trades I'm looking for:

CRP Xerox

Prophet HHKB (Not E-white)

GMK Botanical

Keyboard will be desoldered with a FR-301 and PCBs cleaned and tested afterwards. I prefer split backspace on everything which is not the norm. However, I can keep it soldered if you want. Just want to let this board go to someone who'll use it so feel free to offer.

Hello everyone! I'm clearing out more of my keyboard stuff that I don't use:

|Item|Price|Available?|
|:-|:-|:-|
|TC-V3 - black top, silver bottom - Bought awhile back from someone on r/mm. Really like the board, I just can't stand the micro USB port. Built with lubed vint blacks by the previous owner, feels pretty nice to type on. Came with some very small (almost unnoticeable) scratches in the anodization that I wasn't originally aware of - they are documented in the album. Edit: forgot to mention, TX bag is included. GMK Eclipse not included.|$750 shipped conus (OBO)|Yes|
|JAK - Kota - Vibrant Violet|$75 shipped conus|Yes|
|ePBT Royal Alpha|$80 shipped conus (OBO)|Yes|
|Ink PC KBD67 MK II - new, unused, soldered PCB|$320 shipped conus|Yes|
|Green PC KBD67 MK II - unbuilt, soldered PCB, dyed by yours truly. Turned out very well, but with some small defects shown in album|$320 Shipped conus|Yes|
|Clueboard 66 - Hot White - limited run, powder coat white with a slight red pearlescent. Built with lubed 65g T1s. Finish has some slight defects (dust under coat in some areas, seams and edges kind of ""show"" through the coating, scratch on the inside of one of the screw holes)|$260 shipped conus (OBO)|Yes|

All prices include shipping to the continental US. At the moment I'm not willing to ship outside of the US or Canada. CA buyers will need to pay the difference in shipping.

I'm also looking for the following:

Keysets:

* SA Green Screen - at minimum green alphas and mods, open to other kits as well.
* GMK Coniferous

Artisans:

* SUK Patriarch - Dreamscape
* SUK Keybuto II - Akai Katana
* SUK Firefang - Neon Sun
* SUK Keybuto III - Keybento

I'm also looking to purchase someone's extra SS Mira SE and KFE CE weights.","[US-NC] [H] Duck TC-V3, KBD67 MK IIs, ePBT Royal Alpha, JAK Kota, Clueboard 66 [W] Paypal, Keysets, Artisans, SS KFE and SS Mira SE weights"

Mainly looking to trade for a Vega in black/grey/e-white with a hotswap PCB, Aperture Norbaforce MKII or $800 SHIPPED.

I really want a Vega or Aperture Norbaforce so thats why I'd prob prefer to do a straight trade lol.

The board is cerakoted white and I will provide more pictures upon request however, the board is essentially flawless.

Comes with 2 builds - currently installed is an fr4 snow pro combo built with lubed and filmed retooled blacks with sprit 63.5 progressive springs. GMK lubed stabs. All LEDs work on the SnoPro PCB. The second build is Stainless Steel plate on stock PCB with lubed mint holy pandas. Durock lubed stabs. Did not get to finish soldering LED on this board as I did not purchase them.

**PLEASE READ: Important information about the Satisfaction 75.** 

There are a few issues with the board. 

Most importantly, that the PCB is faulty. I pulled the pad and copper trace on the ""2"" key, which lead to both ""F1"" and ""2"" keys not working. I have tried fixing the PCB with no luck and don't have the patience to wait for R2 extras to start using the board again. I can include the PCB (with or w/o Durock stabs) or not for those that want to tinker around with it.

The other issues are cosmetic, this is a B-stock board from the extras buy on Cannonkeys and there's a small color difference between the top and bottom blocks. It's noticeable when you angle it a certain way under bright light. There are also a few small dings on the case and tarnishing on the brass components.  

Feel free to ask me questions or request additional pictures. 

Sat75 is not FCFS, will prioritize trades and Socal locals. Prices are shipped within CONUS. Not doing international at this time, sorry.

Thanks for looking!

Hi and thanks for viewing my sale post! Beautiful set here, but life, so sadly I’m parting ways. I’d be happy to get it into the hands of another git lover.

Details: this set is not BNIB, I just still have the box and sleeve. I am the original owner from the group buy. I can ship in the box or do bags for a little cheaper, we can talk. I have used them pretty regularly, so you can expect some shine on the alphas and main mod keys, but a lot of the other mods are unused. No chips or blems, really just need a good bath at most.

*WTB Prophet Full PP/Nylon ANSI Plate - accidentally bought an ISO one - seeing if anyone is willing to part with theirs otherwise I'd be waiting for the extras*

Prices include shipping to CONUS (via USPS) – International shipping can be considered & will be covered by buyer

Not FCFS but priority given to bundles > local (92708) > those willing to do asking price > others

Bundling will let me give you better discounts on the items & everything can be OBO - no lowball offers please! Always willing to negotiate prices.

Willing to consider trades as well, make me an offer - worst that can happen is I say no.

Hello, MM! I hope that everybody is having a nice start to the New Year. 

**Please comment, then follow up with a PM! Not FCFS.**

(See bottom of post for more detailed images)

**KBD67MKII:** 

\-Grey top and bottom case with all hardware

\-Hotswap PCB

\-Brass plate

\-Lubed Smoky Durock stabilizers

\-Foam between plate and PCB and PCB and case

\-Brass weight 

\-All original packaging 

The brass plate has minor switch removal markings, otherwise it is in pristine condition. Brass weight will come fixed to the bottom case and is in great condition as well. The board itself is wonderful and sounds/feels GREAT; I am selling simply to help fund another purchase. 

Asking $250 shipped CONUS. 

**Dwarf Factory SA Apollo Moon:** I would *REALLY* like this to sell with the board, in which case I would let it go for $310 shipped CONUS for the pair. Otherwise, $70 shipped CONUS. 

The images of the board (timestamp and images below) contain various angles of the cap. The DF website has images of it as well! You may have to go back a couple of pages. Selling for the same reason as above. 

For trades, I am open to hear about anything you may be interested in trading, though, I would mainly be interested in 60-75% and used GMK sets. I will also trade the DF Apollo toward a board or for other accessories! 

Thank you for reading my post!

Hi MM,

Looking to sell this board I'm no longer using. Selling price is less than what I paid for it.

\- Flawless case / rose gold PVD weight. To my eyes, there are no external flaws to the case. Pictures have been added to the album for you to confirm.

\- I had a copper plate cut for it to match the rose gold weight which is included in the price. Comes with the wilba PCB (QMK/VIA) and the original box.

Trades I'm looking for:

CRP Xerox

Prophet HHKB (Not E-white)

GMK Botanical

Keyboard will be desoldered with a FR-301 and PCBs cleaned and tested afterwards. I prefer split backspace on everything which is not the norm. However, I can keep it soldered if you want. Just want to let this board go to someone who'll use it so feel free to offer.

Hello!

I'd like to either trade or sell this WoB Hiragana base set. The set has no shine, but it has some minor quirks:

* The ''Tab'' and ''caps lock'' caps are from GMK Griseann, not from the Hiragana base set. This also means that you get the other Griseann caps lock keys,  which include the windowed caps lock key. I think the 2 text shift keys are also not from the Hira base set, but afaik the rest is all original.
* It does not include a split backspace cap.

I'm very interested in GMK and CRP sets. If you'd like to buy it outright, I'd like to see **150eur excl.** shipping. Keep in mind that I will ship the caps in bags, the tray is not included. I do not mind shipping outside of the EU.",[EU-NL] [H] GMK WoB Hiragana base set [W] Trades or PayPal

Selling my new fully built NEO G67 in the purple/green colorway that I have been using for about only a week now. I really like the look, sound, and feel of the board but I got my hands on another board that I really wanted in the same color. Board is a soldered PCB with NovelKey Creams lubed with 3204. Stabs are clipped GMK screw-ins and also bandaided and balanced. The board is a gasket mount with a brass plate and I personally love how it feels and sounds.

Mainly looking to trade for a Vega in black/grey/e-white with a hotswap PCB, Aperture Norbaforce MKII or $800 SHIPPED.

I really want a Vega or Aperture Norbaforce so thats why I'd prob prefer to do a straight trade lol.

The board is cerakoted white and I will provide more pictures upon request however, the board is essentially flawless.

Comes with 2 builds - currently installed is an fr4 snow pro combo built with lubed and filmed retooled blacks with sprit 63.5 progressive springs. GMK lubed stabs. All LEDs work on the SnoPro PCB. The second build is Stainless Steel plate on stock PCB with lubed mint holy pandas. Durock lubed stabs. Did not get to finish soldering LED on this board as I did not purchase them.

Hi MM,

Looking to sell this board I'm no longer using. Selling price is less than what I paid for it.

1\] Pwner XENO silver 75% -> $650 shipped CONUS OBO

\- Flawless case / rose gold PVD weight. To my eyes, there are no external flaws to the case. Pictures have been added to the album for you to confirm.

\- I had a copper plate cut for it to match the rose gold weight which is included in the price. Comes with the wilba PCB (QMK/VIA) and the original box.

Trades I'm looking for:

CRP Xerox

Prophet HHKB (Not E-white)

GMK Botanical

Keyboard will be desoldered with a FR-301 and PCBs cleaned and tested afterwards. I prefer split backspace on everything which is not the norm. However, I can keep it soldered if you want. I'm also looking to move this quick so if you have a number in mind that is lower than my asking price, please let me know.

Please don't hesitate to offer in PM if you wish to. Please comment here before PMing me.

[Picture with keycaps](https://ibb.co/9H26C8Q)

Selling my Iris Rev. 4 Build. It was fun to build, but I got a good deal on another keeb on here and don't think I should keep both. Looking to sell WITHOUT keycaps for **$120 shipped** to CONUS. If you would only like to purchase it if I include the keycaps, then I would like to sell it for **$200 with the GMK Red Samurai Ortho keycaps** as pictured in the second picture above. Not looking to sell the keycaps alone since I can still return them to Amazon for a full refund. The TRRS cable in the pictures will also be provided. 

Specs are listed below:

* Iris Rev. 4 PCB 
* 3D Printed plate, bottom layer, acrylic middle layer, and high profile shell
* Soldered Gateron Ink Blacks v2
* M2 standoffs in the acrylic mid layer with M2 hex screws securing the top and bottom together 
* Adhesive tire weights attached to the bottom of each side to add around 340 grams to each side

Sound test recorded on my iPhone: [https://streamable.com/wak7ov](https://streamable.com/wak7ov)

As seen [in this picture](https://ibb.co/v1NgWNQ), I had to saw off a section of the right side mid layer to make room for the USB-C port since the mid layer got in the way of it during assembly (you can't see this while using the keyboard). Even though the M2 screws are hex, they are easily tightened and loosened using a torx screw which is what I did.

I am selling my HHKB Pro 2 Type S. It has been custom painted iridescent electric blue with a satin finish. There are some blemishes on the front of the board as well as the back which I did take pictures of. The bottom of the board did collect some dust when painting so just keep in mind that it is not a perfect paintjob. Also in the last photo of the album you will see that I masked off each of the slider housings so as not to get any overspray in them. The paintjob did not effect performance at all, and I took great care when masking to make sure that it would perform as normal. Included is a set of blank black caps minus the Fn and Esc key which are red and blue as shown. If you have any questions, let me know. The board has also been lubed and used the factory silencing rings. **$180 + shipping or trades**

I am selling a TKL resin wrist rest I just made. It has not been used, only posed for photos on my instagram. There are some minor blemishes on the top that are only visible if you look very close in the right lighting. The bottom edges of the rest have been sanded but it is not visible at all when it is on your desk. It is a white pearl with subtle black swirl. **$40 + Shipping or Trades**

I am selling / trading my SM Keyboards butterstick with a faulty PCB. The PCB might be repairable if you know your way around it, but if not you can always get a new pcb. It is transparent purple and blue acrylic. I would prefer to add this in as part of a trade, but I might also be willing to sell it. **$35 + Shipping or Trades**

Up for trade is my White POM Iris Rev 4. It was built and used for less than 10 hours, and was just disassembled using a HAKKO FR301. The layout just isn't for me. The only ""defects"" worth noting is that I did need to make some cuts on the bottom plate to make the pcb fit properly (See pics for details) but keep in mind it comes with two brand new plates if you would prefer to make the cuts yourself, it also has some scratches on the top plate from removing the switches, but they aren't anything major. It comes with a bunch of extra parts as pictured a well as the stabilizers on the pcb. **$135 + Shipping or Trades**

Hello r/mechmarket,

Unfortunately I am having to sell my beautiful F1-8X due to financial constraints. The board is built with Creamsicles (cream stem in tangerine housing) that have been meticulously lubed by Memories from [Ashkeebs](https://www.ashkeebs.com/switch-lubing-service/) using 205g0 on the stems and bottom housings, spring swapped with Sprit 63.5G slow curved springs (lubed with 105 oil), and filmed with black Deskeys films. The board is pristine all around and has a beautiful sound/feel. The board was also professionally assembled by [Andy Nguyen](https://youtube.com/c/AndyVNguyen), here’s a [sound test](https://youtu.be/X6ePRzeBLqs). I will include all original packaging and accessories.

I am asking $1100 shipped CONUS, this is lower than what I paid for the board.

I forgot I had this!  It's a shame I wasn't able to get GMK Darling... and now it's wayyy above my price point.

I can ship internationally; just ask for a quote, and total price will be calculated accordingly. Due to current situations, however, it may be prohibitively expensive. If in rare cases of Local Cash, I live at 95472. Of course, the price would be lowered if it's a local deal.

Please ask if you have any questions or inquiries. **Offers are welcomed.**

1. Black/Dark grey Clueboard - $200

This is a ver.2 case, built with L+F 67g V2 Zealios stem swapped to retooled black stems (super smooth!). Lubed with 205g0 housings/stems, 105 on springs, filmed with black TX films. Pre retooling GMK screw in stabilizers lubed with 205g0. Also has a sorbothane sheet in the bottom of the case for sound dampening. Two issues with this board, the first is a small dent on the top left hand of the bottom case I have a up close pic in the timestamps. The second is the stab for the R shift is slightly binded by the case which cause that switch to feel slightly heavier (this is a known issue with ver.2 cases & can be fixed by filing down the extra material on top case).

It will come with the GMK Oblivion keycap set that is pictured on it - the Rama ""X"".  I have used this keyboard for about two weeks and I can't see any shine on the caps. It is the Navy / Dark grey configuration that was recently released by Cannon Keys and it's built on an FR4 6.25U plate.

Will come with the Cannon Keys carrying case and in the original box.

Hi everyone,

Getting rid of some more stuff.

**Space65 R1 Keyboard** \- **$500 free shipping**   \- still available

**Keycaps not included**

Egg color (e-white top, e-yellow bottom, black badge)

PCB with MillMax 7305 sockets installed

Carbon Fiber plate

Aluminum plate

Bumpons (unused) will be included

Some issues to know about the Space65. The keyboard is definitely used but in good condition overall. I don't see any large scratches.

The CF plate I think is slightly too thick, so you can see the case doesn't quite close all the way (the board currently has the CF plate in it so you can see what it looks like in the picture). The aluminum plate does not have this problem.

The Esc key and the Right arrow key scrape against the corner of the case slightly when you press them. Would recommend against using any non-plastic keycaps in those spots.  I actually had 2 Space65 boards briefly, and they both had the same problem, though I haven't really heard of anyone else having that problem for some reason.

The aluminum plate is very tight when it comes to installing switches. I believe this is a common problem with many R1 aluminum plates. JWK switches (Alpacas etc) work OK, but Inks don't fit well.  The CF plate doesn't have any problems with Inks.

[Timestamp](https://i.imgur.com/aNEKsho.jpg)

I recently acquired this WoB Hiragana set, however, I think I'd rather trade it for something else if at all possible. The set has some quirks:

* Tab and caps lock caps are from GMK Griseann, not from the Hiragana base set. This also means that you get the other Griseann caps lock keys, which include the windowed caps lock key. I think 2 text shift keys are also not from the Hira base set, but afaik the rest is all original.
* It does not include a split backspace cap.
* There is no shine and/or any other exterior damage.

I'm very interested in:

* CRP sets
* GMK sets (Oblivion specifically)
* MT3 sets (Susuwatari specifically)

~~Hey everyone!~~

~~I have my Mode80 Founders Edition Light up for grabs today. It's in B+ condition, has very small minor flaws on the some corners of the pvd brass bottom.~~

~~It comes built with lubed and filmed thick thock marshmallows (205g0 and deskey) on a FR4 plate w/ lubed durock stabs. It will also come with an extra pvd brass plate and plate gasket, alongside all original packaging and identification.~~

Hi everyone! I got back into keebs again after a hiatus but I promised myself I'd get rid of things that were collecting dust before I took on the new year to build more. So here is my clearing out sale! If you have anything that I'm looking for, you can use it to offset the costs of buying anything else. I'm posting this before bed but will address inquiries on a FCFS basis.

&nbsp;

If you'd like to buy a hotswap board with a different set of switches, let me know in your PM and we can adjust the price accordingly. Switches can be installed and sent ready for use as well. Available switches: Filmed Silent Alpaca, Glorious Panda, Box Jade, THICC Filmed Tangerine, MOD-M Tactile, Box Brown Outemu, Cherry Blue.

&nbsp;

All prices are shipped, CONUS only.

Hi MM,

Looking to sell a couple of boards I'm no longer using. Selling prices are what I paid for them plus paypal fees and shipping.

1\] Pwner XENO silver 75% -> $750 shipped CONUS OBO

\- Flawless case / rose gold PVD weight. To my eyes, there are no external flaws to the case. Pictures have been added to the album for you to confirm.

\- I had a copper plate cut for it to match the rose gold weight which is included in the price. Comes with the wilba PCB (QMK/VIA) and the original box.

\- I paid $700 + shipping for it from someone on MM. So really just recouping that.

2\] Nebula ver S TKL Red -> $600 shipped CONUS OBO

\- Kind of a rare commodity. Beautiful board with curvy sides and a unique bottom. GH link: [https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=104484.150](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=104484.150)

\- Flawless case. Brass parts were uncoated / thinly coated so will patina. You can lock the finish with lacquer if you wish.

\- Comes with 2 PCBs. Both are in VIA/QMK. I have the original box for it as well.

\- I paid $550 in GB (shipping included)

Prophet HHKB (Not E-white)

GMK Botanical

Both keyboards will be desoldered with a FR-301 and PCBs cleaned and tested afterwards. I prefer split backspace on everything which is not the norm. However, I can keep it soldered if you want. I'm also looking to move these boards quick so if you have a number in mind that is lower than my asking price, please let me know. 

Please don't hesitate to offer in PM if you wish to. Please comment here before PMing me.

In excellent condition and includes what you see in the photos. M6A, case, and key tool. The pcb is hotswap, but white led's are soldered in so if you want to swap switches you have to desolder the leds. Very lightly used and works great. Photos seem a bit like it has marks, but it simply needs cleaned. Zeal V1's and GMK Silence caps are installed.

Hello! About 6 months ago I built a Lattice60 from a GB. It's an amazing board and I won't be mad if it doesn't sell, but I'm looking at another GB in which I want to put my freshly collected Vint Blacks in. 

The board:

Used for about 2 months (had to build my pc before i could use the board after building it.)

Box Jades, with a YOK panda spacebar, and Polar Panda enter key. (all switches are lubed by me with krytox 204g0). Genuine GMK screw in stabs lubed properly. 

MicroUSB threaded cable included. 

KuroShiro caps NOT included (unless you can offer your a\*\* off lol) but i can throw a set of blacks on it for a very nominal fee if you really need me to.

Hello!

Bumping this set I previously listed as incomplete (without 2 enter keys), but I'm now selling it 100% complete, no missing keys. It is unused.

This is not like the Obscure kit with just 40s mods, it's a standalone set that ran a few years ago which includes alphas, numbers, and ortho mods and spacebars. It'll cover an ortho board by itself, no base kit needed. ~~**Asking $145 shipped.**~~ Sold $145 shipped.

[This](https://i.imgur.com/TWMKtGB.jpg) is what the kit includes.

Please comment before PM and let me know if you have an offer or any questions. Thank you, stay safe everyone!",[US-MO] [H] Complete GMK 9009 Ortho Kit (Includes Alphas & Numbers) [W] PayPal

Hello, I have decided to streamline my collection and sell some things to join one of the upcoming (and sometimes expensive) group buys. Willing to discuss prices. I am selling the following things:

&#x200B;

**SOLD** [~~Tokyo60 V3 + diffuser - keyboard, foam, stabs \[130€+shipping\]~~](https://imgur.com/a/3eXr19R)

Bought brand new less than a year ago from Drop. Has the optional acrylic diffuser and MKUltra foam between the plate and the PCB. Stabs are Durock V1 clear with original GMK sliders because I liked them more.

Currently uses MX Zilents (Cherry MX Silent Red stem and bottom housing) and Aliaz top housing. Inside are Sprit 63,5g springs (bottom-out weigh, actuation around 45g), lubed with Tribosys 3204, making it very, VERY quiet and deep-sounding. Keycaps are KBDFans R1 XDA.

Case has no dents or scratches and everything works, including QMK.

Would prefer to sell this entire keeb as a set as it was built that way and if somebody buys it that way I'll add the Chameleon artisan as a token of good will.

&#x200B;

**SOLD** [~~CM Novatouch TKL ANSI \[220€+shipping\]~~](https://imgur.com/a/E33KvN0)

Bought a few years ago brand-new, used not too often as I prefer silent linears. Comes without the original box. Still has the original keycaps and they are worn appropriately to their age, same goes for the case. The are no dents, cracks or major scratches, the plate is clean and everything is 100% functional.

&#x200B;

* [SP DSA Granite + SP DSA Standard mods \[65€+shipping\]](https://imgur.com/a/ha52vmx)

I used those for a few months with my first keyboard and they've been untouched since then. Curiously, there wasn't an Esc key in the combo set so I had to use a 1U red DSA blank. They don't have any blemishes or shine.

&#x200B;

**SOLD** [~~KBDfans R1 XDA \[35€+shipping\]~~](https://imgur.com/a/nBKSMR3)

Bought them for my Tokyo60 and since I'm selling it I don't really need those keycaps. I think it's the same profile that they now call NP on KBDfans and the set is named 'Grey and White' these days. They have a pretty large surface which might not be for everyone and sound really quiet with the MX Zilents. Keycaps are in great condition.

&#x200B;

* **MX Zilents 60x \[50€+shipping\]**

As silent as it gets. Cherry MX Silent Red stem and top housing, Aliaz bottom housing. Sprit 63,5g springs, lubed with Tribosys 3204, lightly used. They are currently in the Tokyo60 keyboard.

&#x200B;

**SOLD** [~~The Eye Key Chameleon artisan \[25€+shipping\]~~](https://imgur.com/a/hdWetmh)

I realized that my keyboard doesn't have any keys that I don't use and I basically have nowhere to put it. Bought brand new from Drop, in perfect condition and comes with the original box.","[EU-SK] [H] Tokyo60 V3, Novatouch ANSI TKL, KBDfans R1 XDA, DSA Granite + DSA mods, MX Zilents 60x, The Eye Key Chameleon artisan [W] PayPal"

I hope you're all doing great! Shuffling a little bit my collection. Before we go further, a quick word:

&nbsp;

※ This will not be FCFS, I will go like this: Trades > Bundles > Sales.

※ All prices are *OBO* meaning that I may accept lower offers, feel free to negotiate. I don't want a bid war, if a key is marked as pending/sold/traded, no need to PM me to offer more.

※ Prices include PP fees but don't include shipping (PM me for confirmation);

※ **Should we trade, please keep the declared valued under $20, my country is a bitch in Custom fees (€30 flat + 21% of the total value (items + shipping))**.

Assembled D65.  I have owned it for 3 days.  Right after I assembled I saw the Box 75 GB is coming up very soon so looking to replace one of my 65% boards with it and this is the one I would be willing to part with.  Black aluminum case, hot-swap PCB, brass plate, brass weight, ships in original box with all accessories (extra gaskets, extra screws, tool to loosen case screws).  I replaced the stabs with clear, gold wired Zeal screw-stabs (lubed with G-Lube  no rattle), will also include the screw-in cherry stabs that came with it.  Rubber feet are already attached to the bottom.  Currently built with Bushi Tactiles.  Purchasing options below.  **Prices include shipping to CONUS only and PayPal fees**.  If you purchase with Mauves I can go ahead and put them in for you if you want.

I really want a Vega or Aperture Norbaforce so thats why I'd prob prefer to do a straight trade lol.

The board is cerakoted white and I will provide more pictures upon request however, the board is essentially flawless.

Comes with 2 builds - currently installed is an fr4 snow pro combo built with lubed and filmed retooled blacks with sprit 63.5 progressive springs. GMK lubed stabs. All LEDs work on the SnoPro PCB. The second build is Stainless Steel plate on stock PCB with lubed mint holy pandas. Durock lubed stabs. Did not get to finish soldering LED on this board as I did not purchase them.

Hello all, I have more things that I no longer plan to use. Sorry, but CONUS for now.

&#x200B;

Keyboard bundles:

~~Space65 R1 Bundle (Includes built keyboard, extra carbon fiber plate, MK Ultra foam, and GMK Voyage set (Base + Novelties + Mission Map deskmat))~~

~~I really love how this one looks, but sadly I haven’t used it as much anymore after I got my Vega. Selling to fund my other hobbies and collectibles. Keyboard is built with Holy Trash Panda switches (lubed with Krytox 205g0), Durock stabs, and aluminum plate. No external defects as far as I can see, but the bottom right rubber foot has a slight tear due to accessing the screws.~~

~~Extra keyboard pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/pNHFNmu](https://imgur.com/a/pNHFNmu)~~

~~Extra CF plate is from R2 and new. The MK Ultra case foam was used once. Plate foam was never used.~~

~~GMK Voyage set has been my daily driver for a couple months (no gaming). There isn’t any shine as far as I can see. Can't ship with the tray, since it won't fit in a flat rate box with the keyboard, but I can ship the outer cover upon request. Mission map deskmat was used for roughly the same amount of time. No staining or fraying. Wiped off any bit of dust and lint that I saw.~~

~~Looking for $850 shipped for bundle. Will split if someone wants to buy the board without the extras.~~SOLD board only

&#x200B;

~~Leopold FC660M bundle (Includes stock keyboard and MT3 Serika keycaps (Katakana + Mods + Numpad + Extra Mods + Novelties + 6U black spacebar + 2 1.25U Geometry caps (NOTE: SOME MOD KEYCAPS ARE MISSING))~~

~~Extra keyboard pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/XHyVCr4](https://imgur.com/a/XHyVCr4)~~

~~Thought this would be a keyboard that I would bring to the office, but that never really happened. Keyboard has Cherry MX clear switches, stock stabilizers, and no stock keycaps.~~

~~As for the keycaps, I basically bought two incomplete modifier sets and combined them together. There are definitely more than enough keys to fill a full-sized board, but it might be a dealbreaker to others. Because the FC660M spacebar is non-standardized, I added adhesive putty to the underside of the spacebar that adheres to two plastic stems I cut off from a cheap keycap. I can remove the putty or provide extra upon request.~~

~~Keycap list: (Red means missing, Green means there are 2 of the same cap)~~

Odd post, hope it's not against the rules since I do want a board.

~~I have an ASUS TUF 3080 I picked up this week in a drop, but don't have a need for it. I'm interested in trading for interesting 65%, 75%, and TKLs, with a slight preference for 75%s and TKLs.~~

~~For full disclosure, the 3080 is at my mom's place (it was safer shipping there) and I'll be picking it up this weekend.~~ Sold to a friend for MSRP, sorry. Thanks for everyone's offers, just decided to prioritize someone I knew instead when they asked. 

VOC is brand new from Novelkeys, never took it out of the bag. GMK VOC was released around when these shipped, so I ended up going for that instead. Asking $185 shipped, 175 local.

Hey r/mm,

Happy New Year!

Time for me to clean out some of the stuff that just isn't getting as much love these days. If I don't get back to you right away I've likely fallen asleep and will get back to you in the morning. Please PM before messaging. :)

All items listed are in USD and shipping is not included. Local socially distanced pickup is also an option in the Toronto area. Not FCFS, priority goes to bundles, local and Canadians.

Been gone awhile but back to purge the closet a little. I'm copy/pasting some info from an older post, but timestamps are updated. Items and prices are in bold, descriptions follow, all prices are in USD and include CONUS shipping.

~~**For starters we've got a SouthPaw Extended 65%** with left-hand numpad, Cyan case with black plate. Perfect condition, as it was sold to me new. Comes with two sets of feet, 4 and 9 degrees, mini-USB PCB, and all necessary hardware. PCB tested working, has backlighting capability and underglow LEDs installed. **Asking $365 shipped CONUS**~~ **SOLD**

**GH60 build.** Wooden case made by /u/lxkhn. One of the inserts has pulled out but doesn't effect the security as there are 5 others. The insert and screw are both included, along with the rest of the hardware. 

Mini-USB PCB with mill-max sockets to make it hotswappable. Stabilizers included (GMK Screw-in). Apparently one of the screws off the spacebar stabilizer was lost at some point, but doesn't seem to make a difference, as I never noticed, just mentioning for full transparency. 

Plate is silver aluminum, and also included is a piece of mk-ultra case foam to dampen the noise from the case a bit. Easily removable if you end up not wanting it, just slips in under the PCB. All you need to complete this board are switches and a cable (see below for some options) **Asking $100 shipped CONUS**

**Cables** for sale are a pink/white thick coiled mini-USB and a small coil blue/purple mini-USB.  The former has a bit of a loose coil but it's still in very good shape, and the latter pairs quite well with DSA Borealis and similar. Both tested working. **Asking $28 shipped for Pink/White, $18 shipped for Blue/Purple. Knock $10 off if purchasing alongside a keyboard.**

~~**CYSM Booo** in the Stupid Dog! colourway. The last of my artisan collection, just want to make sure it finds a good home. **$75 shipped CONUS**~~ **SOLD**

~~**DSA Milkshake Weirdo Alphas + TKL + MacOS kits**. Lightly used, I can take more detailed pictures if requested. Asking **$180 shipped CONUS**~~ **SOLD**

As far as trades go, I'm interested in fun, unique, group-buy keyboards, but primarily looking to sell. 

Like I said, been gone awhile, so priced to the bets of my ability but let me know if anything is too ridiculous. Thanks for reading guys.","[US-VA] [H] Southpaw 65% LHNP, GH60 w/ Wooden Case, Cables, CYSM Booo, DSA Milkshake [W] Verified Paypal"

Hi there,

Hello MM bruhs and bruhettes, I have some goodies up for sale today. I tried to price everything pretty fair for a quick sale as I'm kind of in an emergency situation and in need of funds. If something is crazy just please let me know, can work on a deal or if you want to bundle something. Thanks for looking :)

**GMK Nautilus Nightmares** \- Complete base kit with box trays. Box it a little beat up but keys are great, no shine as seen in the pics. **$200**

**ePBT Valentine** \- Complete kit, comes in a bag. Very nice keycaps for the price. **$75**

**67x Kailh Pro Purple** \- Lightly tactile switches with the bump at the VERY top, kind of unique in that way. A decent switch. **$20**

**~~Tofu60 Aluminum Black~~** ~~- dz60rgb\_ansi v1 hotswap, durock purple screw-in stabs lubed, has case foam. Has a small nick on the front left corner (see pic). Everything you need beside switches and keycaps, luckily I have those available below :)~~ **~~$160~~** Sold!

**~~NK65 Entry Edition Frost~~** ~~- I wasn't gonna put this up for sale but just incase anyone is interested. It does have a small crack in the PC housing at the top left corner. It's there but in normal use hardly noticeable. If you're interested I can show a pic of the crack up close.~~ **~~$125~~** Sold!

**~~Tofu60 Clear Acrylic~~** ~~- Gasket modded feels and sounds great, screw-in stabs, Holy Polar Pandas lubed with Tribosys 3203, underglow RGB, case and pcb foam. This is a great entry to getting yourself that amazing gasket feel and sound at a budget price.~~ [~~Video~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2BQEavCfrg) ~~of how this was done (not mine).~~ **~~$180~~** Sold!

GMK Oni Deskmats - 69 a piece

Originally bought one to keep one to sell when I had my own room to be a degen in. But given the rona my brother veto's it since weebshit on the desktop he mostly uses wasn't gonna fly so here it is for 69 a piece because mm loves the funny numbers. Bnib, never cummed on and never used.

~~Buy both and you only pay 68.99/pc and I eat the shipping cost.~~ one sold at 65 shipped. Might keep the second but only one is available if at all.

Edit: after a couple months and just recently received 3 messages within a week, the deskmat is still available but I rather keep it so unless you want to offer 300 shipped or something it's probably not for sale (even then it depends how you catch me).

47x Burgundy housings red ink stems lubed - 20
These are the outcome of my farming some burgundy linears and swapping in lubed red ink stems. Just the stems are lubed and the springs aren't touched. 1 has an mx clear spring but it's just as heavy as the rest so not that big of a difference tbh tbh


Minivan B stock 3dp cases - 20
Got literally too many of these stupid things tuning my printer so have at it if you want it. They are all scuffed bottom but it shouldn't affect the actual use. If you want to supply your own hardware you need 7x 3mm standoffs, 7x 5-6mm screws and 3mm screws.

 If you want me to add some as well just add 5 bucks since I'm running low screws. Buy more than one for any god forsaken reason get em at 15 a piece.

The space65 is also in great shape. The top row of keys is kind of wavy due to the plate being a little bent. Not that noticeable but could use a resolder. Also I messed up the layering on the keys and the Fn key does not work. It comes with lubed C3 tangerines (1st ones) lubed with krytox 205g0.

Hello guys! Hope your 2021 is going great, or at least okay :)

I'm selling a bunch of KAT Milkshake kits today, as well as GMK Violet Tendencies Base kit, and GMK Oblivion Spacekeys kit (Take note this is different from the spacebars kit). The following prices are **not** inclusive of shipping

I am looking to donate some cash from this sale to a local cat rescuer, can view her instagram at [.@fioloh](https://www.instagram.com/fioloh/?hl=en). She has been helping many stray cats/dogs (mainly cats) find homes, seek medical help (including surgeries) as well as helping to foster. I found her work really meaningful (especially because I like cats). Hence, I'll state 2 prices (just $10 difference), if you would like to help, you can opt to purchase the slightly more expensive price, it's perfectly okay if you don't want to. The donation will be publicly recorded at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asY5BAWSZ_pmxUy2jxmaSa1eHDddTiLQlEhGi1niuyw/edit#gid=1722981492), under tehbingg. I'll update here once donated. (I hope this is allowed by the mods, otherwise please let me know, I'll be willing to remove.)  Prior donations from previous sales have been made (can be seen in the spreadsheet).

All of these kits have **no shine,** and feels pretty new. I can provide more photos upon request:)

This would not be FCFS as I would like to prioritize the donation prices to help a little more.

Case used for 3 months, pcb/plate/switches used for a month. Bought while my main keeb was in production.

The switches (65g) have thicc films and are lubed with 205g0. The stabs are everglide screw-in (except for the shift, wich has a gmk screw-in). The spacebar switch is a gateron silent black ink, but I'll include a couple spare durocks.

Looking  to see what I could get in trades for my KBD8X. I love this board, it  feels and sounds amazing. It is fully built on a soldered PCB with lubed  creams and GMK stabs. Both have been lubed with 205g0. There is evo foam under the pcb as well. Aside from the brass weight needing a little bit of a  clean, it is in incredible condition. I am thinking of getting rid of it  because I am realizing that I prefer smaller form factor boards.

I  am mainly looking for a higher end 60/65% board either built or  unbuilt. I am happy to hear all offers, and am willing to throw in extra  money on top depending on the trade. Please comment before PM'ing.",[US-AZ] [H] Built WKL KBD8X [W] Trades

SA Monochrome Oblivion has a healthy amount of shine, as I am not the original owner. I typed on them for about 2 weeks. It also comes with the hagoromo numpad and a grab bag full of color-matched blanks + modifiers from other oblivion sets. There's a bunch of keys as you can see. Mysterium not included. Will be shipped in bags.

MT3 Susuwatari - Purchased from Drop a few months ago, used for a few weeks.  Little shine. Great set.

I keep going back to lower profile keycaps, so I'm mainly looking for trades for reasonably conditioned GMK and ePBT sets. I'm willing to add PayPal if necessary. I would be plenty happy to trade for most GMK Oblivion sets and ePBT Kuro/Shiro.

I'm not motivated to sell for PayPal. But if someone really wants to buy it outright, I'll sell MT3 Susuwatari for $120 shipped and the SA Oblivion for $175 shipped CONUS.","[US-TX] [H] SA Oblivion, MT3 Susuwatari [W] GMK, ePBT, and other cherry profile caps, PayPal"

Hello everyone.

Today, I have decided to sell my Percent Studios Canoe Gen.2, due to a lack of use. The keyboard is built, with 2 separate plate/PCB combinations, both of which will come with the purchase of the board. The details can be seen below;

**Keyboard Casing**  
\- This is the panda variant of the board, with an e-white top, silver metallic mid-section and a black soft touch bottom case.   
\- Externally, it is in a very good condition, with no flaws that I can see. The black bottom and silver weight are fingerprint magnets, so that might be something to note.  
\- Internally, there are some small blemishes to the mid-frame, such as the indent for the caps-lock LED and a factory scratch (?) to the top left corner, but these are obviously not visible when assembled.  
\- The kit came missing one of the screws for the silver front accent piece and one for the mid-section, but these have no problem staying solidly in place without.

**Aluminium (original) Plate / PCB - ISOUK**  
\- This is the original plate for the kit, which comes assembled. The plate is in good condition. The PCB is in a poor-ish condition, as this was my first keyboard and solder job. The solders are okay but not that great, but all fully functional. I have soldered in a working white LED for the caps-lock.  
\- This build is using 67g C3Equalz Tangerine switches, which have been lubed using Krytox 205g0. It uses GMK stabilisers, which have been lubed using Krytox 205g0 too.

**Polycarbonate Plate / PCB - ISOUK**  
\- I bought the polycarbonate plate just before christmas, and it provides an interesting, deep sound for the board. The plate itself is in a very good condition, due to newness. This comes built with a second PCB, which has a far far better solder job as I had practice this time round. Again, a working white LED is soldered in for the caps-lock.   
\- This build is using ZealPC Tealios v2 switches, which have been lubed using Krytox 205g0. It uses Durock v2 stabilisers, lubed with dielectric grease.   
\- Please note, due to a lack of 1 (!!!) Tealios v2 switch, the enter key is using a Turquoise Tealios 63.5g. I do now have a final 63.5g Tealios v2 for this switch now, which I will provide for you to solder in if you want.

**This Keyboard Comes With**  
\- Top, middle and bottom case  
\- Bottom weight  
\- Feet assembly  
\- Original case sound dampener, plus two sheets of cut foam for sound dampening  
\- Aluminium plate / PCB BUILT as above  
\- Polycarbonate plate / PCB BUILT as above—  
\- Original instructions manual  
\- Plate screws (in baggie)  
\- Pink and white spare light accent (in baggie)  
\- 1x Tealios v2 lubed with Krytox 205g0  
\- Original packaging

I'm looking for 275 usd usd plus shipping, but I am open to offers so please comment and then PM me if you have any questions

~~[Timestamp:](https://imgur.com/a/MHuwB2m) This is a Lin Whale in the Navy colorway. It is built with gat inks lubed with 205g0, filmed, and spring-swapped with Durock 65g gold springs on a Hiney FR-4 plate and Hiney h87a PCB. The stabilizers are from C3 round 2 in grey. There are a few scuffs on the back and bottom edges of the board, none of which are visible when the Whale is sitting on the desk. There is anodization mismatch on top and bottom as per the norm with all Whales. Comes in a generic keyboard case. Please take a look at the album!~~

~~**NK65 Entry Edition Smoke $80 shipped**~~ SOLD for 70

~~[Timestamp:](https://imgur.com/a/D4x8qOe) **PLEASE READ** Bought this second hand from another user, but I seem to have issues with some of the sockets from the “7” key to the “-” key. Not too experienced with hot-swap sockets to fix them, but I lowered the price and maybe you could give it a go? Might just be a simple fix by bending with a pin, but maybe the sockets need replacement altogether. The plate is scratched around switch holes probably from pulling switches out repeatedly. Other than that, the keyboard has some Stupidfish foam inside to help with the resonance, and all accessories from the original package are included. No exterior marks or scratches.~~

The switches are ""Preams"" a switch I ""invented"" and I think a few people have tried out. I wrote a post a while ago here https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/b1wwtj/preams/

These preams are made with pro plum stems, NK Cream housings, 65g Sprit springs, switch films, and 3204 lube (but not directly on the leaf or legs). They basically feel like pro purples, but a touch lighter and sound better IMO. The spacebar is a 205g0 lubed Gat Ink.

The cable is made by Summit Cables, there's about 3.25ft after the coil. Comes with original box. https://imgur.com/a/NDGoVgr **$760** (edit: more pics of bottom with natural light https://imgur.com/a/cGn9te4)

**Sold for asking price GMK DMG R1** Base kit of the first DMG run. It has shine but due to the color of the caps and my artificial lighting I can't get it to show in the pictures. I'd call it a medium amount, it's not full blown but if you don't like the feel and look of shined ABS this one isn't for you. Never mounted on Box switches.

* I really enjoy this board, but it is not getting that much use any more. While I love the Alice layout, I don’t think I love it enough to need two boards with it.
    * Matte white. White, thick 5mm plate. This is a sound test of a similar [build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM5Z9kcD8eE). Check the description for the other guy’s opinion as well.
    * Includes a custom made silicone dampener that can be seen in the timestamp.
    * 67g Zilents V2. Lubed with 3204 and springs “donut-dipped” in 3204 as well.
    * Project Keyboard R1 PCB (mini). USB component on top. Flashed with VIA.
    * GMK Screw-in stabs. Lubed and tuned with 205 and Permatex. One stab (backspace) uses a gold colored wire, but still features GMK plastic. Clipped and band-aid modded.
    * 8 degree typing angle (same as TGR Alice)
    * Features three supporting feet
    * I posted a number of photos in the timestamp featuring keycaps for examples builds. CAPS NOT INCLUDED.


[More Photos](https://imgur.com/a/xCDumrW )

* Additional Notes:
When the RGB is cranked all the way up, there is some bleed through from the under glow, but you can see when it is toned down, you don't get that. The board is essentially three layers. The lower that is the plate, the top which hides the bottom of the caps, and then a thin clear layer that the feet are attached too. Bottom layer screws on. The two board layers were bonded together, sanded and then painted. Screw holes are tapped, and then threaded inserts added. Made in Korea. AknYang guy really did a bang up job. Rubber bumpons, it sits firm to the desk. I custom made the silicone dampener, it has some weight. Didn't really do much for the sound, but too out some echo-y-ness.",[US-WA][H] Acrylic Alice [W] Paypal

Hello Mechmarket, unfortunately it is time for me to exit this hobby, and with that, comes the sale of my boards. These have all been used for around 1 month, and have been on my shelf, sitting on an acrylic stand purchased from Amazon. The details of each board are as follows.

&#x200B;

|Keyboard|Switches/Stabs|Keycaps|Details|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Hotswap Glass Green Acrylic Alice Clone|Novelkeys Blueberries|ePBT WOB|Bought from a mechmarket user. I believe he printed the case himself from ponoko. It originally had the problem of the case overlapping the PCB on a few keys, and I had to sand down the case in order to make sure the keys fit. Unnoticeable when assembled, but you can see it when dismantling the keyboard. Sneakbox USB-C PCB, keycaps are in great condition. Only problem with this board is that the original owner did not print it with a plate, so the entire middle section of the board just has the switches sitting on top of the PCB. I don't know how bad this is for the PCB but it has no effect on the typing experience. It makes it very annoying to change the keycaps because the switches inevitably get pulled out too.|$200 Shipped|
|Acrylic Arisu|Gazzew U4 Boba 67g/Durock T1 (on number row and right side macro keys)|Jelly Pom Pink|Bought the kit (and the keycaps) from another mechmarket user. In great condition, barely used as I could not get used to the layout. USB-C, no LED's. Currently the case is a bit wobbly because one of the screws is not screwed properly & I don't want to mess with it, but I can ship the board disassembled if necessary.|$300 Shipped|
|SC Bifrost Radiant Electrotype60|Gateron Merlot |ePBT Purple on White (?)|Again, another board purchased from mechmarket. USB-C Cannon Keys AN-C PCB, no SC case feet but has rubber bumpons. I did a sound test for this board [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3xr8aIym-0). I got the keycaps from a different mechmarket user and are in great condition.|$350 Shipped|
|KBDFans E-White Hotswap Tofu60|Banana Split 63g|ePBT x GOK BoW|I honestly don't want to sell this board but I love my Discipline more. It has a USB-C CannonKeys Instant60 PCB, a KBDFans pink aluminum plate, and a silicone case dampener. No shine on the keycaps, but the plate is slightly bent on the bottom right corner, causing the right control key to be ever so slightly tilted to the right. I believe that this is so miniscule that it would need to be pointed out in order for people to see it.|$350 Shipped|

Not willing to part out the boards.

I can ship worldwide, however if you are not CONUS, I'd have to ask you to pick up the shipping cost. I can't remember the brand of stabilizers used in these boards, but I've only ever purchased Durock, GMK, and Cherry branded ones. The stabs in each board are lubed and the switches all are lubed and filmed.

I am local to 92880, so if you would prefer to meet up locally, I am available to do so as long as a mask is worn. As always, please comment before PM'ing me, and I'll try to get back to everyone in a timely manner.","[US-CA] [H] Acrylic Hotswap Arisu, Acrylic Hotswap Alice Clone, SC Bifrost Electrotype60, E-White Hotswap Tofu60 [W] Paypal, Local Cash"

Hi everyone,

I am selling a built E-White KBD67 MKii (KEYCAPS NOT INCLUDED).

This is the soldered version but it has been soldered with Millmaxx 0305 to become hotswap. The board is via ready, stabs are lubed, switches are lubed and filmed SoHo switches with Milky Gateron Yellow tops with Gat Yellow springs. This bundle will also include a black POM plate, white FR4 plate, and default brass plate. For the stabs, the left shift and enter are GMK screw in stabs while the space bar and backspace are durock screw in stabs. This board has been used for about 6 months but it does have a very minor cosmetic issue on the back side of the case (hardly visible) I included pictures in the timestamp. 

Price for bundle: $400 shipped **SOLD**

Edit: Bundle will also include stupidfish’s case and plate foam.",[US-CA] [H] E-White KBD67 MKii Bundle [W] PayPal

**1. Matrix 2.0 Add & GMK Matrix 01 Bundle: $1,500**

Selling this bundle for a friend. The board is pale white coated and in flawless condition with the original packaging. Currently built with stock Banana Split switches. GMK set has only been typed on for less than an hour and shows no shine. Not splitting at the moment. 

**2. LZ-MP Red Kit: $2,950**

Sad to let this one go but I don't see myself building it anytime soon, just don't have the time. The kit is brand new and never been built on. There are smudges on the plate, which is unavoidable with this type of  brass finish (PVD). They will be wiped off as much as possible before shipping. Complete with the original LZ bag & PCB. Number 34/50.

Looking for people with some decent trade history, if not here, then elsewhere on Reddit. If you're local we can discuss more. Also interested in trades for balisongs such as a live blade Krake Raken. Also CNC tooling, especially TTS tooling, carbide endmills, and maybe metrology stuff. I didn't put those in the title for obvious reasons.

Sorry I won't be answering pms tonight, got stuff to do.

~~######GMK MIZU BASE KIT - $360 or best offer~~

~~Light use, no shine, according to its previous owner and my own eyes. Bought it off of mechmarket last summer and never got around to using it because it didn't have perfect compatibility for the strange board I was using at the time :T. Only selling with the tray, I don't have the box, I just have it in a tray from some other GMK set that I sold in bags.~~

~~######GMK DOTS BASE KIT - $330 or best offer~~

~~This I did use for several months. The heaviest shine is found on the ""•"" key, the ""•"" key, the ""•"" key, and on the 2.5u and 2.25u split spacebars. The ""•"" also has some light shine... What do you want from me here? It's the usual suspects, the row 1 ""E"" key and such, but you can switch any key from the same row around, including the numpad, so shine isn't all that important in my opinion here *unless you are one of the special people using split spacebars*. Sold in its tray with box.~~

~~######GMK HYPERFUSE - $210 or best offer~~ SOLD to /u/rickygupta217 for $150

~~Bought it on here, I didn't use it, again with my freakish layouts. There's some very faint shine on the 6.25u spacebar, can't see any on the rest. I don't know if this is the first Hyperfuse or Hyperfuse Origins (which is supposedly in stock on Originative), or if there's any difference between the two. I'm just putting it up for what I bought it for, if you've got info or can offer a reasonable price with a reasonable reason I'm ok with that.~~","[US-NJ] [H] GMK Mizu, GMK Dots, GMK Hyperfuse [W] Paypal"

* I really enjoy this board, but it is not getting that much use any more. While I love the Alice layout, I don’t think I love it enough to need two boards with it.
    * Matte white. White, thick 5mm plate. This is a sound test of a similar [build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM5Z9kcD8eE). Check the description for the other guy’s opinion as well.
    * Includes a custom made silicone dampener that can be seen in the timestamp.
    * 67g Zilents V2. Lubed with 3204 and springs “donut-dipped” in 3204 as well.
    * Project Keyboard R1 PCB (mini). USB component on top. Flashed with VIA.
    * GMK Screw-in stabs. Lubed and tuned with 205 and Permatex. One stab (backspace) uses a gold colored wire, but still features GMK plastic. Clipped and band-aid modded.
    * 8 degree typing angle (same as TGR Alice)
    * Features three supporting feet
    * I posted a number of photos in the timestamp featuring keycaps for examples builds. CAPS NOT INCLUDED.


[More Photos](https://imgur.com/a/xCDumrW )

* Additional Notes:
When the RGB is cranked all the way up, there is some bleed through from the under glow, but you can see when it is toned down, you don't get that. The board is essentially three layers. The lower that is the plate, the top which hides the bottom of the caps, and then a thin clear layer that the feet are attached too. Bottom layer screws on. The two board layers were bonded together, sanded and then painted. Screw holes are tapped, and then threaded inserts added. Made in Korea. AknYang guy really did a bang up job. Rubber bumpons, it sits firm to the desk. I custom made the silicone dampener, it has some weight. Didn't really do much for the sound, but too out some echo-y-ness.",[US-WA][H] AKnyang Acrylic Alice [W] Paypal

Hey there everyone, hope you're doing well

Today I have a few boards I'd like to put up for trade/sale considering they don't see too much use and would be better suited to someone else.

**PLEASE READ** -  I will be unable to ship ANY ITEMS until January 12th at the absolute earliest. Please keep this in mind when inquiring about trades or otherwise. 


Item | Description| Want
---|---|----
FMJ80| Black WKL. Currently built with Gerry's (cherry housing + gat yellow stem + 68g SPRiT slows lubed with 3204 and 105 on springs) on an alum half plate. The case is in good condition with a very slight ding on the right side above the left arrow key. Comes with USB converter. Can desolder if preferred. Keycaps not included. | $1250 OBO, Trades
Kokua| Grey. Currently unbuilt. Kit includes 3 PCBs ( a twice desoldered ProjectKB pcb that is fully functional (USB Mini), hotswap USB-C Sneakbox PCB, and a brand new Mechlovin PCB (USB-mini)). Also comes with three plates: brass, red aluminum, and 3/4 Hiney FR4. Please see the following images for slight issues with the finish https://i.imgur.com/f9GGzjJ.jpg https://i.imgur.com/jojLOYv.jpg. | Sold for $750 (1 PCB + 1 Plate)
KMAC v1| Silver. Currently built with lubed (3204) retooled blacks and 65g TX springs on a full aluminum plate. Keycaps not included. Still not 100% whether or not I'll let this go. | ~~$650 OBO, trades~~ Sold for asking
[ALF DC60](https://imgur.com/a/9OhYubE)| E White. Currently built with Alpacas (lubed with 3204) on an alum full plate and lubed Zeal stabs. The case is in very good condition with a very slight ding on the left side near the shift/caps lock key. Including PBT muted (purchased from flashquark) as pictured in the build, but will include the remainder of the kit too. Will include a steel full plate and a PCB that currently will not connect due to a loose USB-C connector (I believe it just needs solder added to the joint, but I'm no expert). Also due to 3m tape wrapped around the plate/pcb the left control has very slight stick if pressed down aggressively, but you can always remove the tape. Ships in original box.| ~~$200 shipped OBO~~ Sold for $170
[Lubrigante](https://imgur.com/a/sVIbnYm)| Built with 205g0 lubed NK blueberries on a wonderland PCB. Some flaws: To disclose some of the flaws: I lost two of the original stand-offs for the screws. I found ones that fit into the cutouts for the standoffs, but they're slightly longer than the ones provided with the kit originally. They fit more snug, so it's not that much of an issue. [These photos](https://imgur.com/a/5nv6yxi) from the original owner also show that he had to install wires to bridge some switches. The switches that are affected are H and right B, as he accidentally ripped a trace during a desoldering. With the wires, the keys work just fine. No sticker(s) are on the bottom now| ~~$180 shipped OBO~~ Sold for asking
| GMK 8008 | Used base kit and obscure kit (used lightly for approximately 1 month) | ~~$280 shipped~~ Sold for $250

For trades I'm primarily interested in some TKLs and a select few 60% boards. KFE (yes, I know, but I really like silver), FLX Virgo, or a 456GT or Koala (lol). I could be persuaded to trade something for a Kei as well (prefer SE if anyone is looking to get rid of one). Also looking for OG dyesubs should someone be looking to get rid of theirs. 

If you have something else interesting feel free to offer away, the worst I can say is no :) Also, we can discuss adding paypal on either end of the trade if necessary. 

Feel free to ask any questions or request further images :)

Not FCFS. Will get shipped out as I am able, as mentioned above.

Thanks for looking, and as always please leave a comment before you PM.

timestamp and gallery: https://imgur.com/gallery/w5jkwNa

Cherry G80 1800 custom: This is not one of the painted cases offered by TKC, but instead a stock case that I vinyl wrapped. The corners are a bit rough with some wrinkles as this was one of my first wrap jobs, but overall looks pretty fly imo. Uses c3 tangerine switches before the redesign, 62g if I remember correctly. $160 shipped + pp fees  (gmk caps only for show, not included) 

Also a NMB clicky black space invader keyboard. In very good condition and has the cool split spacebar feature that can be toggled between 3 different modes. $65 shipped (PENDING)","[US-NH] [H] Cherry G80-1800 custom with TKC parts, NMB Split backspace keyboard [W] Paypal"

Hi, friends. I've replaced mechanical keyboards with newer hobbies over the years. Trying to find loving homes the keyboards, keysets, and artisans I'm now neglecting. As always, PM before commenting.

Priority to those buying multiple items. Prices include shipping to CONUS. Keysets ship in bags. Extra costs for international shipping.

All artisans have MX stems. Also - I'd prefer to keep the JK Constellation Series as a set.

Thanks!

hello, I am looking to sell my e white kbd 67 holy panda build

It is a soldered board built with bsun red holy pandas with halo true stems on a brass plate, the switches are lubed with tribosys 3204 avoiding the legs to keep tactility and krytox 106 for the springs. the stabilizers are the zeal stabs which are lubed with krytox 205 g0. The board also has stupid fish foam in the bottom as well as in between the plate and pcb, and has been burger mounted with o rings for the top mounted plate.

As some of you may know the kbd67 suffer from a reverberation when typing due to the design of the weight on the back causing the fins of the weight to reverberate. I have cut and placed tape in between the fins which has eliminated all of the reverberation completely, making this a great sounding board

I bought this a while ago back when I was first starting to get into building my own keyboard but that never progressed so it just sat in the box. I'm now committing to a different build and realized it's going to be expensive so I'll be using the funds from this to build something to get me started. 

Did some research but wasn't really able to find one that was BNIB within the last 6 months. Some used were in the upper mid 300s, others higher but with novelties. That being said, I'm looking for $400 local or $420 shipped to CONUS. Price negotiable if not reasonable, but again, wasn't able to find an exact match.

Hello mechmarket and happy new years! Today I have for sale a keyboard and keyset I no longer use and have been sitting in a drawer for sometime.

I am local to the bay area and am happy to do local trades w/ proper safety precautions. All prices do not include shipping and are OBO, and I am open to trades for ortho keyboards and keysets. Not FCFS, priority for bundles and local deals :)

PENDING TRADE ~~Liminal: $140. This is a great intro 40% keyboard with base [compatibility](https://i.imgur.com/iGhoIxN.jpg) with most GMK base kits, meaning you don't need a 40s coverage kit. (I've been using the Susuwatari base kit on it). Black P3D Store 3D printed case, I really love these cases, IMO they are the gold standard for 3d printed cases. PCB Soldered with lubed (205g0) MX Zilents (Silent Linear built with Cherry Silent Red stems and Zilent housings). The keyboard is flashed with VIA for ease of programming/changing layouts.~~ 

SOLD $85 ~~Susuwatari: $90. This base kit is in excellent condition as it was put on the Liminal and only used briefly. No shine/texture wear on the alphas, most other keys were never removed from the tray. Shipped in bags as my paper tray box has frayed significantly.~~","[US-CA] [H] Liminal w/ MX Zilents, MT3 Susuwatari Base kit [W] Paypal, trades"

Hello everyone!

Today I post just about everything nice I own to try and find a Iron165 or Bauer or just end up selling everything to fund some other projects I have going on. I would prefer the Iron165 or Bauer to be built and I know that limits my search some but I don't know how to solder well and not trying to learn on something so expensive. I priced every item based on recent sales but if something seems off on the price please feel free to let me know. I am open to negotiations within reason as well. I will ship everything purchased this weekend on Monday afternoon to try and just make one trip to the post office but if you need it sooner I can try to accommodate that. I only am looking to ship to the CONUS currently. I will mark out the items that get sold so everyone knows what is available. I will return messages as soon as possible and return them in the order I received them. I hope something I posted today catches your interest! Thank you for looking!

EDIT: lowered some prices to attempt to get some additional interest

Board is built with Tealios spring swapped with slow Spritz lubed and oiled with 3204. Board is built on a teal aluminum plate. Will ship in the original box. ***ASKING*** $2400 shipped as a bundle or $2200 shipped for 1/65 and $250 shipped for wrist rest (will also trade for Iron165, Bauer, Satisfaction75 or other interesting boards)

\-**Rama Works U80-A Moon**: Board is flawless. I was super careful mounting and un-mounting switches so the brass plate has little to no scratches.

Will ship in original box. ***ASKING*** $900 shipped

Hey guys, hope y’all are safe and healthy!

I have the following sets for sale, prices do not include shipping.

I am looking to donate some cash from this sale to a local cat rescuer, can view her instagram at [.@fioloh](https://www.instagram.com/fioloh/?hl=en). She has been helping many stray cats/dogs (mainly cats) find homes, seek medical help (including surgeries) as well as helping to foster. I found her work really meaningful (especially because I like cats). Hence, I'll state 2 prices (just $10 difference), if you would like to help, you can opt to purchase the slightly more expensive price, it's perfectly okay if you don't want to. The donation will be publicly recorded at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asY5BAWSZ_pmxUy2jxmaSa1eHDddTiLQlEhGi1niuyw/edit#gid=1722981492), under tehbingg. I'll update here once donated. (I hope this is allowed by the mods, otherwise please let me know, I'll be willing to remove.)

&#x200B;

This would not be FCFS as I would like to prioritize the donation prices to help a little more.

My ask price is 400 which may sound absurd but this is my first board that I’ve modded and am not in a rush to get rid of it.  I spent a total of 15 hours on this keyboard and am only trying to sell it to recuperate some funds spent on future projects.  Thanks for looking and Happy New Year.",[US-NY][H] Drop CTRL Sentinel Edition (High-Profile) with GMK Red Samurai Alphas and Holy Red Pandas lubed and filmed. [W] Paypal
