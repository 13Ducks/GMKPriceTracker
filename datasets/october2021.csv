[Old pic of this black drop alt with sugar plum (keycaps already sold :// )](https://imgur.com/a/afYH9Eu)

*\*\*\*Hotswap PCB has a couple keys not fully functioning: esc, 0, and I key will only work with certain switches. I can include those switches if you buy the board. You can PM me if you have further questions about this defect. Defect was noted by previous seller. Other than that, the board and RGB work just fine! The build is very quiet overall, board is in great condition. This was my gf's daily driver for a few months and I ended up getting her a different board.*

Hey guys! Apologies for all the posts, just wanted to make an updated one because I was recently able to get a Kei from extras, so I am no longer looking to trade the suit for one. Looking to sell off some boards as I'm moving away from TKLs and want to downsize my collection.

Keyboards in excellent condition. 

Please note one of the switches ( think the O switch) has a gritty feeling when pressing it. This is how it was when I purchased the keyboard and I meant to replace that switch but never used the board that much and eventually forgot about it. It’s perfectly usable but you may want to exchange that switch at some point.

I  also ordered the entire GMK Devoted set (keycaps + cable + deskmat + RAMA), I could reserve it for the person buying the Devoted kit, if interested.

*Keycaps*

Some of these items are rarer now.  (GMK Nautilus being on of the original GMK sets).  I have owned it before, I bought this again but never put it on a board.  It is also an investment.  This set is marked massdrop (its that old) and to be unopened R1 is a rare thing.  Perhaps the only one in existence.

Keyboardbelle does not currently make cases, so this case defines a particular era in the hobby, looks great and is an investement.

I will only ship in the EU and shipping will be around 20 EUR.  I will give discounts on multiple items..

Item | Notes | Cost
---|---|----
Vulcan PC Maja w/ extra plates and wrist rest | Vulcan x KBDfans Maja in PC. Comes with three plates: normal Brass plate and two custom plates, one in PC, one in Aluminum. Both plates have custom flex cuts to allow for consistent flex and sound in the board. PCB has been desoldered. It has been tested and works, except for two key locations, which should be fixable by handwiring (a couple of lifted pads are the problem). Price adjusted to account for this. FWIW, the Maja is going to be rerun soon, so extra PCB should be available shortly. Also comes with plate/PCB foam, PCB/case foam, wrist rest, and hex screwdriver for disassembling the case.  | $550

One of the first custom keyboards that came with hotswap sockets. I am selling a Silver V1 (low profile) with a red plate. Layout B (which is rather unconventional). It's actually quite a nice low-profile board. Almost no bezel to it. Here are a few[ photos with SA keycaps](https://imgur.com/a/p3Nmm) but it also looks quite good with GMK. Will relube stabs before shipping.~~

One of the most significant part of this board is its signature sound - here is after assembling [sound test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7USktI9kYA&t=166s), antoher part is its soft typing experience due to plastic (acrylic) plate. Can include lubed durock v1 stabs for 12 euro. And for 28 euro more can add gh60 minilla pcb.

You may ask me why? Let me tell a story (and specify keyboard's specs along the way). Once upon a time there was a black anne pro 2 chassis - a case of a keyboard, which was a real kickstarter of the hobby and one of the main contributors of it blowing and becoming mainstream. This keyboard not only blow the keyboard hobby but also helped emerge so many YouTube channels like :3ildcat or minimalistik. Then there is this versatile pcb YD60MQ aka gh60 minilla: gh60 pcb was one of the first pcbs that had qmk aka comfortable programmability: this version is the the newest and have type c (and the type c port is nicely flush with the case!) and it still holds the name of original reminding where and when qmk and all keyboard customisation (on software side) started. In this board there is also a main character aka the most unique part of the keyboard: gateron ""vintage"" tangerine v1 switches lubed w/krytox 205g0 - these switches are rare like the unicorns hair, not sold anywhere, but only here. Also it is not just simple ""all switches soldered board"" - on all stabilized keys I soldered hotswap sockets (specifically gold plated mill max sockets), which lets you mod stabilizers even further - and we all know hotswap is another thing which made hobby so much more accessible to those who don't want to solder... and that is the end of the story :) btw one switch is different and its gateron yellow ink lubed with 205g0 and with tx film on it since I was out of tangerines. So don't wait and purchase this history packed keyboard! +7 euro can add 60% keyboard storage bag (leather like)|120€|

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered/linked to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation thus for trade PM is needed.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-80 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus the one I recommend (FEDEX/DHL) generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster. I recently added an option to choose slow shipping option, but I don't recommend it for expensive items (its like USPS) - choose this for those at your own risk.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct.
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay (with no refund), but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, write something like* **""I have a question, pm""** *and ask it* **PM** *not here .* **All other comments** *which are not refering to PM on post* ***mostly*** *are* **IGNORED** *(or with an instances if commenter is mod) and if they happens to be threadcapping (something like: ""lower the price"" ""because I want to sell my own set and threadcap your post so your would be ignored"") or toxic - reported. Thank you for your understanding <3*"

Hey! Looking to sell my GMK Bushido bundle that's just been taking up space. They were **very** lightly used with little to no shine. Comes with the base kit, Samurai kit (novelties), as well as the Dishonor kit (red alphas). I will only sell the novs and alphas separately once the base kit is sold (post will be updated).

I'm also open to trades for other GMK sets so shoot me a pm with what you have. Highly prefer a local sale in Mississauga/GTA, preference goes to Local > Ontario > Canada.

Hello All!

I have bundled boards together with keycaps for two reasons:

1. People can buy a full board for approximately what it would cost to buy the parts separately.

2. Selfishly, the fewer sales I have to coordinate and packages I have to send out the better

I believe the bundles are reasonably priced and are at approximately the cost I paid. All prices include shipping to the USA. US only please, sorry.

Hey guys, just hoping to get some things that are not being used into the hands of someone that they will benefit more. All prices are OBO and include shipping CONUS only. I am not looking to ship outside of that, sorry. Please comment before sending PM, no chats, and PayPal only. Transactions will be done via invoice including G&S fees on my end. Feel free to reach out with any questions.

Not necessarily FCFS, will prioritize bundles and users paying asking price

If the listing does not say sold - the item is still available.

Board is silver WKL in good condition. there is some small patina marks on the brass weights that you should be able to pick up in the picture. there is also a slight ano-mismatch between the top and bottom. other than that the board is in next to flawless condition. it will come with a desoldered FAV87 PCB and alu leaf plate. i forgot to put the feet on in the picture but i do have them, and they will of course come with the board. i do ***not*** have the original case for the board.

[E-White WKL Prophet](https://imgur.com/a/yJfAB8C) \- $400

Board comes with a brand new PCB and a nylon half plate. There are two small imperfections in the front corners. they are completely unnoticeable in use, and particularly the one on the left side is next to unnoticeable unless specifically looking for it. board is otherwise in perfect condition.

Slight shine on some of the more used keys. tried to capture this as best i could in the photos provided, also added keys with no shine on them at all for comparison. Will ship in bags as i do not have the original trays for them.

# Info

Price drop; paring down the collection and hoping to find a good home for everything :)

Items are not FCFS, are OBO (below asking), and shipping costs are not included. Bundles are convenient and happy to negotiate a reasonable bundle price. It's also generally helpful if messages are clear and actionable (provide ZIP and PayPal in the initial message so I can quote shipping quickly). Unless they are marked as sold, they are still available. Local to SF Bay Area, California.

CONUS shipping preferred, but I can accommodate international shipments at the buyer's expense.

Reddit: PM only, I will not respond to any chats. Comment before PM'ing please.

Discord: flatwhite#0009 - comment below still, please.

Please note that the caps inside yellow boxes are being sold as pairs, it would be a shame to split them as they are meant to be together.

\* bongo skulls are not for sale, they go with bongos

Will only ship CONUS, so you need to be CONUS or have a proxy, i will not ship international.

Paypal invoice only, fees are included in the shown prices.

Shipping is not included in the price - will only ship priority and insured for full value so add 8$ to your total cost, for shipping, i will cover the insurance cost.

**For the caps that are marked as TRADE**, this is my wishlist:  [https://imgur.com/a/i1mpnV8](https://imgur.com/a/i1mpnV8)I am not interested in anything else, so please don't offer things outside my wishlist. Will do 1:1 with UWU Greg Jamjam, otherwise 1:2 for the rest.

Big bundles (5+ caps) have priority and get better prices.Comment before sending a PM please, and only use the ""send a PM to this user"" function, and not the chat.

It has a e-white nautical badge, e-white back weight and white rubber bump ons. Comes with all original packaging including all original accessories, Two hotswap PCB’s from mouser tech, two FR4 plates(one from grey studios and one from mechland) and a polycarbonate plate. Asking $780 shipped or best offer for the entire bundle. 

GMK LASER: im selling my GMK laser R2 set because I don’t use it enough. The set has only been mounted once and has no shine. Base + spacebars + novelties. Everything is a little disorganized but I will send all the original packing trays. Looking for $140 shipped

Hi MM, me again. Not really sure how I came to own this stuff that I have never used, so hoping I can pass it down.

# Keycaps

**GMK Laser Synthwave M170 - $100 USD**

Barely used GMK Laser set originally purchased from Drop. I really like the set and was hoping to use it on a build at some point, however this never transpired. With that said, the keycaps are in excellent condition (I can provide extra photos is you're interested), with no shine. I would say they were mounted for about a month, but used for maybe 2 weeks.

**~~BNIB GMK Nautilus R2 - $190 USD~~** **SOLD for $190 USD**

~~Sealed base kit. Not sure how I ended up with two of the same base kits... This hobby... well, it confuses the mind at times. Because I already have this set, I never opened this one, thinking I would use it for a build for a friend. This never happened, so here I am selling it.~~

**~~BNIB ePBT x GOK BoW - $100 USD~~** **SOLD for $85 USD**

~~ePBT x GOK Black on White PBT keycaps. Never even opened the trays, just the outer brown box to check what was inside. These were bought from KBDfans, which regularly restocks them.~~

# Switches

**~~82x FFF Switches - $70 USD~~** **SOLD for $70 USD**

~~Lubed (with 205g0 on housings and stem) and filmed (with Deskeys 0.3 mm films) switches. They are also spring swapped with TX 67g, 16mm springs lubed with 105g0. Will also ship with the original springs (also lubed with 105g0). I used these switches for around 1.5 months, but even after spring swapping I could not grow to like how these felt. Selling above stock price for lubing job, and spring and film cost.~~

**~~82x Stock Gateron Phantom Red Switches - $20 USD~~** **SOLD for $20 USD**

~~Untouched switches. Never typed on. Came with my Keychron Q1 pre-assembled kit thinking it would speed up shipping... it did not. So I paid extra for switches and keycaps I didn't want. Not to mention that one of the keycaps was cracked on arrival... but that's another story.~~

Prices do not include shipping. Shipping anywhere in Canada will be **$15 USD** and to USA will be dependent on shipping location. Please message and I'll quote the shipping cost. Shipping via Canada Post/USPS is preferred, but if you want courier I can also provide estimates from UPS. If you want multiple items, I can give a discount. Thanks!"

Hey r/mm,

Today I'm looking to sell some stuff due to volatile work conditions I'm experiencing at the moment. A lot of this stuff is very dear to me, but I gotta stay responsible.

Keyboards

1. **Brutal60 WKL Black -** Second owner, treated it like a baby. Has a really small scuff on the bottom right that was there when I got it. Otherwise, great condition. It comes fully modded to sound a feel excellent. It's built with **L+F Gateron Black Inks v2**, on a **WeirdFlex60 PCB**. It's soldered and I feel like it's the best iteration of the Brutal. Tsangan layout. Keycaps not included. **$280 shipped.**

If you have any cool similarly priced 60% boards that are not WKL, let me know. (I have a bakeneko already) This is the only board I'm considering trading with. Let me know what you have. Prefer 1:1 trade.

1. **Ikki68 Aurora Mint -** Comes with a Forged Carbon Fiber plate from a community groupbuy a few months ago. No keycaps or switches included. PCB is tape modded and this thing sounds great. Looking for **260 shipped** (because of the rather expensive plate that's included.) Comes with the Wuque Carrying Case!

Keycaps

1. **HK gaming Modern Dolch - $34 shipped**
2. **HK gaming 9009 - $34 shipped**
3. **GMK Mizu Clone - Probably the best clone I've encountered for this set. $40 shipped**

_________________________________________________

Little backstory on Geekark Tea, it was a small GB that I was in, I believe that there will be a public GB for it in the upcoming months. This was my first opportunity at trying out Geekark as I've never owned any of their sets. The colors looked nice so I joined! Delivery was crazy fast, something like 2 months after I had said yes to joining. There are more pics of it in the timestamp. My overall review of the caps is that the color and reverse dye sub are really nice, legends are ultra crisp. I'm just not a fan of the texture, they felt like shined GMK caps, but without the shine lol. Feel free to ask questions on the set, I will answer any and all questions on it!

Got into this hobby and realised I went overboard. Looking to thin out the herd and the boards/keycaps I don't use as often.

All prices are OBO, and include shipping costs with insurance. International is fine as long as you're willing to cover costs and understand that there's no international insurance for shipping. Local is Westchester N.Y., New Rochelle specifically. Not FCFS, I'll prioritise those that have more feedback or local pickups. No trades!

Keyboards:

Btw you can always buy new top layer if small crack bothers you (asked switch couture seller). Case feets included! Works with hotswap pcb - tested. One of the most significant part of this board is its signature sound - here is after assembling [sound test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7USktI9kYA&t=166s), antoher part is its soft typing experience due to plastic (acrylic) plate. Can include lubed durock v1 stabs for 12 euro. And for 28 euro more can add gh60 minilla pcb.

You may ask me why? Let me tell a story (and specify keyboard's specs along the way). Once upon a time there was a black anne pro 2 chassis - a case of a keyboard, which was a real kickstarter of the hobby and one of the main contributors of it blowing and becoming mainstream. This keyboard not only blow the keyboard hobby but also helped emerge so many YouTube channels like :3ildcat or minimalistik. Then there is this versatile pcb YD60MQ aka gh60 minilla: gh60 pcb was one of the first pcbs that had qmk aka comfortable programmability: this version is the the newest and have type c (and the type c port is nicely flush with the case!) and it still holds the name of original reminding where and when qmk and all keyboard customisation (on software side) started. In this board there is also a main character aka the most unique part of the keyboard: gateron ""vintage"" tangerine v1 switches lubed w/krytox 205g0 - these switches are rare like the unicorns hair, not sold anywhere, but only here. Also it is not just simple ""all switches soldered board"" - on all stabilized keys I soldered hotswap sockets (specifically gold plated mill max sockets), which lets you mod stabilizers even further - and we all know hotswap is another thing which made hobby so much more accessible to those who don't want to solder... and that is the end of the story :) btw one switch is different and its gateron yellow ink lubed with 205g0 and with tx film on it since I was out of tangerines. So don't wait and purchase this history packed keyboard! +7 euro can add 60% keyboard storage bag (leather like)|120€|

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered/linked to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation thus for trade PM is needed.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-80 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus the one I recommend (FEDEX/DHL) generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster. I recently added an option to choose slow shipping option, but I don't recommend it for expensive items (its like USPS) - choose this for those at your own risk.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct.
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay (with no refund), but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, write something like* **""I have a question, pm""** *and ask it* **PM** *not here .* **All other comments** *which are not refering to PM on post* ***mostly*** *are* **IGNORED** *(or with an instances if commenter is mod) and if they happens to be threadcapping (something like: ""lower the price"" ""because I want to sell my own set and threadcap your post so your would be ignored"") or toxic - reported. Thank you for your understanding <3*"

Hello All!

UPDATE: Rudy Bundle, Apollo Keycaps, Launchpad are sold. Everything else available.

Been a while and it's time for me to liquidate a bunch of stuff I've been sitting on for a while (not literally, that would definitely bring the value down).

I have bundled boards together with keycaps for two reasons:

1. People can buy a full board for approximately what it would cost to buy the parts separately.
2. Selfishly, the fewer sales I have to coordinate and packages I have to send out the better

I believe the bundles are reasonably priced and are at approximately the cost I paid. Ungodly Launchpad goes free to the first person to purchase a keyboard. All prices include shipping to the USA. US only please, sorry.

Hello! Hope you guys are doing well!

I have some Artisan and Ramas up for sale today.

I am looking to donate some cash from this sale to a local cat rescuer, can view her instagram at [.@fioloh](https://www.instagram.com/fioloh/?hl=en). She has been helping many stray cats/dogs (mainly cats) find homes, seek medical help (including surgeries) as well as helping to foster. I found her work really meaningful (especially because I like cats). Hence, I'll state 2 prices (just $10 difference), if you would like to help, you can opt to purchase the slightly more expensive price, it's perfectly okay if you don't want to. The donation will be publicly recorded at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asY5BAWSZ_pmxUy2jxmaSa1eHDddTiLQlEhGi1niuyw/edit#gid=1722981492), under tehbingg. (I hope this is allowed by the mods, otherwise please let me know, I'll be willing to remove.) Prior donations from previous sales have been made (can be seen in the spreadsheet).

I can provide more photos of any of the items upon request:) All of the items have **not been mounted** and are new/sealed. All prices (US$) do not include shipping.

This would not be FCFS as I would like to prioritize the donation prices to help a little more.

## Klippe R1 (Similar to Tofu60) Build
PCB: DZ60v3 Solder   
Switches: Gateron Pro Milky Yellows, lubed with Glorious G-lube  
Stabilizers: GMK screw-in, lubed with SuperLube + Dielectric Grease  
Plate: KBDFans Brass  
Case: Klippe R1 Silver Aluminum  
Mods: O-rings between pcb and screw posts, small layer of foam that was included  with case

Selling this as I still can't get used to a 60% layout. Layout of the soldered PCB is standard ANSI, **except** it has a 1.75u right shift and a extra 1u key to the right of it, instead of the standard 2.75u right shift. Asking **$150 shipped**.

## ~~Broken Everglide SK87~~ SOLD
Bought this second hand on /r/mechmarket, where the original owner had resoldered the bluetooth cable that connects the PCB to the battery. I accidentally broke it recently and don't really want to deal with fixing it. When you connect it via USB, a few lights on the PCB blink and then it doesn't connect currently; it looks like it needs the bluetooth battery connected to work properly. Does not come with screws that connect bottom case to plate/pcb. Asking **$30 shipped** if you want it to deal with it, or maybe you already have one of these and want to salvage the parts. 

If you're Denver metro local, let me know and we can negotiate a price. Thanks!"

[Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/eBKgqD5)

Hey hey trying to sell my dewdrop Hotswap Owlabs Jelly Epoch built with Durock V2 stabs, lubed and filmed Gateron Black Inks, and GMK MODO Light.

Looking for $980 shipped CONUS OBO

Some notes:
Jelly Epoch is in like new condition, no known blemishes and PCB is fully functional. Comes with original box and packaging. All case and plate foam is in the build. Just missing the little rubber bump-on feet, but they are basically generic $2 bump-ons from Amazon and are prone to sliding off. Board is heavy as hell and has never slid on my desk.

Comes with the full kit of GMK MODO Light in original trays. The keycaps used on the Jelly Epoch show light to medium shine. Mounted once.

The switches are lubed with Krytox 205g0 and filmed, although I forget what brand films I used. All are functional although some housings show wear from install/removal from various Hotswap boards. Never soldered.

The board sounds incredible and besides the light shine on the keycaps is like new. I feel like this is very fair pricing for the bundle, not looking to split so please don’t send offers to split at this time. I will ship via FedEx within 1 business day. Please comment then PM — thanks!"

I've got an assortment of things I'm looking to sell. I no longer have the time to enjoy this hobby as much as I used to, so I'm hoping to pass on what I've collected to those that might be able to enjoy them as they've just been sitting in boxes going unused.

EDIT: SOLD for asking 

The day has finally come where I send this set to another loving home. I’ve been so busy with nursing school so this keyset isn’t getting the love it deserves. 

I purchased GMK Alter around May and I am the first owner to unseal the set and used it for moderate gaming. Falter set has never been mounted but opened for inspection. Novelties have no shine, Spacebars are still sealed. 

Base set has minimal shine on alphas. Deskmat will be cleaned upon request. 

Looking for $926.40 which includes PayPal fees ($0.30+2.9%) plus additional shipping. Will ship out the day after payment via USPS.

Bakeneko60 is not included!! 

Any additional questions, offers, or more pictures etc. are welcome. Thank you for looking :)

Top layer has a small crack near right bottom screw hole (happened during assembly of stacked acrylic case) thus price is significantly cheaper than what I paid (including VAT and shipping in total case costed around 190€). Btw you can always buy new top layer if small crack bothers you (asked switch couture seller). Case feets included! Works with hotswap pcb - tested. One of the most significant part of this board is its signature sound - here is after assembling [sound test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7USktI9kYA&t=166s), antoher part is its soft typing experience due to plastic (acrylic) plate. Can include lubed durock v1 stabs for 12 euro. And for 28 euro more can add gh60 minilla pcb.

Wanted to use myself on planed to buy in future keyboard, but selling because saving for other personally more needed items / tools.|115€|
|**60% QMK/VIA Custom Keyboard with Lubed OG gateron tangerines**|140€ (pp fees and shipping)|158€ (USA USPS tracked and international pp fees) + 45€ for FEDEX|60% QMK VIA Custom Keyboard or Ultimate Keyboard History Keyboard. You may ask me why? Let me tell a story (and specify keyboard's specs along the way). Once upon a time there was a black anne pro 2 chassis - a case of a keyboard, which was a real kickstarter of the hobby and one of the main contributors of it blowing and becoming mainstream. This keyboard not only blow the keyboard hobby but also helped emerge so many YouTube channels like :3ildcat or minimalistik. Then there is this versatile pcb YD60MQ aka gh60 minilla: gh60 pcb was one of the first pcbs that had qmk aka comfortable programmability: this version is the the newest and have type c (and the type c port is nicely flush with the case!) and it still holds the name of original reminding where and when qmk and all keyboard customisation (on software side) started. In this board there is also a main character aka the most unique part of the keyboard: gateron ""vintage"" tangerine v1 switches lubed w/krytox 205g0 - these switches are rare like the unicorns hair, not sold anywhere, but only here. Also it is not just simple ""all switches soldered board"" - on all stabilized keys I soldered hotswap sockets (specifically gold plated mill max sockets), which lets you mod stabilizers even further - and we all know hotswap is another thing which made hobby so much more accessible to those who don't want to solder... and that's the end of the story and along the description :) btw one switch is different and its gateron yellow ink lubed with 205g0 and with tx film on it since I was out of tangerines. So don't wait and purchase this history packed keyboard! +7 euro can add 60% keyboard storage bag (leather like)|120€|

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered/linked to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation thus for trade PM is needed.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-80 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus the one I recommend (FEDEX/DHL) generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster. I recently added an option to choose slow shipping option, but I don't recommend it for expensive items (its like USPS) - choose this for those at your own risk.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct.
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay (with no refund), but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, write something like* **""I have a question, pm""** *and ask it* **PM** *not here .* **All other comments** *which are not refering to PM on post* ***mostly*** *are* **IGNORED** *(or with an instances if commenter is mod) and if they happens to be threadcapping (something like: ""lower the price"" ""because I want to sell my own set and threadcap your post so your would be ignored"") or toxic - reported. Thank you for your understanding <3*"

[Norbaforce Photo Album](https://imgur.com/a/nJi46RW)

\-Norbaforce MKIII PC -- with boxes and both breakout PCB's (for 87u and R2 compatibility)

\-Realforce 87u 10th Anniversary Edition TKL -- with original box and extra keycaps

\- Custom modding by u/ Choobies, Dome swapped to 45g, and lubed with 3203

One of my favorite builds hands down.. This was my first PC build and I wanted to do something very special. I first started with the highly sought after Realforce 87u Anniversary Edition TKL and then swapped the casing (original case, extra keycaps, and box will be included of course) for the Norbaforce Ghost of Chrismas Past Edition Polycarbonate case. I purchased both breaktout PCB's for added flexibility should you want to throw in an RF2 board in there. Leaving no stone unturned, I also had some custom work done by another community member u/ Choobies to replace the 55g domes with 45g domes (harvested from a brand new RF2) and lubed with 3203. The typing feel is just right for me, its light yet tactile and has that deep, thocky sound we all love from topre.

Please see the photo with the sharpie tip, there is the smallest scuff on the forehead of the board. just a surface scratch and can easily be buffed out. The board and internals are flawless otherwise along with the original AE case.

Happy to answer any of your questions, so please let me know!

_________________________________________________

Little backstory on Geekark Tea, it was a small GB that I was in, I believe that there will be a public GB for it in the upcoming months. This was my first opportunity at trying out Geekark as I've never owned any of their sets. The colors looked nice so I joined! Delivery was crazy fast, something like 2 months after I had said yes to joining. There are more pics of it in the timestamp. My overall review of the caps is that the color and reverse dye sub are really nice, legends are ultra crisp. I'm just not a fan of the texture, they felt like shined GMK caps, but without the shine lol. Feel free to ask questions on the set, I will answer any and all questions on it!

Only shipping to USA addresses at the moment. All prices are PayPal G&S and include **USPS Priority Mail** shipping costs unless otherwise stated. Please feel free to offer if it means that these things get out of my hands and into yours.

**IF THE ORION V3 IS SOLD, PRICES WILL BE LOWERED ON ALL OTHER ITEMS!**

**KEYCAPS PICTURED ON ANY BOARD I LIST IN THIS POST ARE NOT FOR SALE UNLESS EXPLICITLY STATED OTHERWISE**

**NO LOCAL MEETUPS.** The last few times I've listed for local meetups, I've gotten people that can't look up my ZIP code and think I'm in a different part of the state than I actually am. All of those messages have just wasted my time, so unless you're willing to show up at my doorstep, no meetups.

Duck Orion v3 | silver WKL, currently built with 65g MX Clears on stainless steel plate with an h87a PCB. board contains internal brass weight as well. **KEYCAPS NOT INCLUDED.** also includes aluminum full and FR-4 half plate as well as two original PCBs. Case has defects that aren't that visible during normal use. you can barely see them in the timestamp and that POV is straight down. the two original PCBs were soldered/desoldered by previous owner, and all I've done is confirm that they were in the box when I originally bought the board. I can't speak to the quality of the desolder job on either PCB as I haven't looked at them at all. **Price WAY LOWER than what I paid originally**. I'm pretty sure this is under retail value for everything considering that the board is built. **I've decided to cover the cost of shipping for the board, so keep that in mind if you'd like to offer.** | ~~$575 shipped~~ | **SOLD FOR $500 SHIPPED**
Creampacas (Cream stem in H1 housing) x117 | I'm just using Creampacas as the general name for a Cream stem in a JWK housing. TX films added, lubed with 205g0 and spring-swapped to Sprit 63.5g Slow springs. One of the switches uses a T1 housing due to running out of H1s. The Creams that I used to harvest these were broken in for 3 weeks before disassembling the switches. I made these well over a year ago, but I've fallen out of love with frankenswitches that aren't MX Zilents or Krelbos. Since it has been a concern as of late, these actually accept Cherry tops pretty well so you can make these into whatever the name of that ""trendy"" frankenswitch is. **Combination of de-soldered and never-soldered switches, not separating the switches into smaller quantities.** *Price is based off of average sale price per switch over the past 10 days.* | $210 shipped | yes!

**PLEASE INCLUDE AN OFFER OR SOMETHING WITH YOUR PM IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY MY ASKING PRICE. IT SIMPLY WASTES MY TIME AND YOURS IF YOU ONLY TELL ME THAT YOU WANT THE ITEM.**

Priority for responding to offers will be as follows:

 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing all items for asking price (will give discount for purchasing all items listed here because holy moly that means you have money)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing the Orion v3
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any bundle for asking price (will give discount accordingly)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any item for asking price
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and sending an offer that I'll accept on any item listed above

Outside of the listed conditions, I'll check based on when you comment **and** PM. The PM is absolutely necessary for the sale of these items. Since I've had this happen before, if there are two people interested in the same item, but one is willing to pay no questions asked while the other has questions or wants to see more pics, I'm 100% selling to the person who will pay no questions asked. Requests for additional pictures will also take longer than you think, so please consider that when trying to secure an item.

Please understand that if you as a buyer and I agree on a price and you back out of the purchase right after I send the invoice, I will refuse to sell anything to you in the future (yes, that includes if you offer me something like $300 on something that I'm selling for much less). 

 **Do not use the chat function**, I honestly don't know how you are taken to the chat function when the bot's verification post gives you a link to PM sellers. I will ignore you and you won't be in consideration for anything until you send me a PM. I will also ignore you if you do not comment before sending a PM.

If I don't respond, it's likely because I'm just busy doing other things. I will get to all messages accompanying comments in a timely manner. Thanks for checking out the post."

Hi MechMarket,

I am looking to sell my base kit of GMK Toxic. I purchased it to use with my bakeneko but ended up selling that so I no longer have a use for it. It has been mounted once, and typed on for around 1 day. Price includes USPS Priority Mail, Signature Confirmation and Insurance to the US (Can ship elsewhere for extra).

Set is used with medium shine on the WASD cluster and spacebar, other lettering has some light shine, as shown on the photos.

I'm adding a reference photo at the end to compare with the set so you can see that it's complete.

~~I am in no rush to sell this board and i am not willing to negotiate on the price, so please do not ask. I love this board and i really hate to let it go, but it just does not see the use it used to - and i need to make some room in my collection. there is slight imperfections on the board that can be seen in the photos that happened during shipping. they are not highly noticeable in use, but they are there. Its built with Boba U4T's on a brass plate, and will come with an additional POM plate. i have all the original packaging/extra front badges/etc.~~ SOLD

[E-White WKL Prophet](https://imgur.com/a/yJfAB8C) \- $415

Board comes with a brand new PCB and a nylon half plate. There are two small imperfections in the front corners. they are completely unnoticeable in use, and particularly the one on the left side is next to unnoticeable unless specifically looking for it. board is otherwise in perfect condition.

[Timestamp:](https://imgur.com/a/ci0RkYX) Built with MX Blacks on an aluminum plate modded with Krytox 205g0, TX films, TX 63.5g springs. It looks to be built with genuine Cherry stabilizers filled to the brim with 205g0. Includes Matrix silicone dampener and tempest modded with what looks like 2 layers masking tape. Brass weight on the bottom has accumulated patina. Slight scuff near USB port. Living Coral is an orange-ish textured coat finish that is very vibrant in person. Works well with neutral sets, and I’ve seen it work well with GMK Handarbeit :)

I picked this up to experiment with the key space foam included inside, but I don’t need the actual keyboard lol. Keyboard is basically NiB but I typed on it for a minute to feel those nice domes. Still has the extra keycaps, keycap puller, and one sheet of key spacer (it is not good). Keyboard has never been opened/modded but it does have some factory lube on the stabilizers.~~

Has a small crack on top layer near bottom screw (happened during assembly) thus price is cheaper than what I paid (not even including VAT and shipping - total costed around 190€). You can always buy new top layer if small crack bothers you (asked seller). Feet included! Works with hotswap pcb - tested. Sound test after assembling [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7USktI9kYA&t=166s). Can include lubed durock v1 stabs for 12 euro. And for 28 euro more can add gh60 minilla pcb.

You may ask me why? Let me tell a story (and specify keyboard's specs along the way). Case is anne pro 2 black - a case of a keyboard, which was a kickstarter of the hobby before it blowed and became mainstream (this keyboard not only blow the hobby but also so many YouTube channels like :3ildcat or minimalistik). Pcb is YD60MQ aka gh60 minilla - gh60 was one of the first pcb that were qmk, of course this the newest type c version, but it holds the name of original reminding where and when qmk and all keyboard customisation on software side started. Switches are probably the most unique of all things mentioned: they are lubed w/krytox 205g0 gateron tangerines v1 - switches that are rare and not sold anymore anywhere - unicorns some would say. On all stabilized keys I soldered hotswap (mill maxed) sockets and hotswap is another thing which made hobby so much more accessible to those who don't want to solder... and that is the end of history lesson :) btw one switch is different and its gateron yellow ink lubed with 205g0 and with tx film on it. So don't wait and purchase this history packed keyboard! +7 euro can add 60% keyboard storage bag (leather like)|120€|

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered/linked to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation thus for trade PM is needed.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-80 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus the one I recommend (FEDEX/DHL) generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster. I recently added an option to choose slow shipping option, but I don't recommend it for expensive items (its like USPS) - choose this for those at your own risk.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct.
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay (with no refund), but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, write something like* **""I have a question, pm""** *and ask it* **PM** *not here .* **All other comments** *which are not refering to PM on post* ***mostly*** *are* **IGNORED** *(or with an instances if commenter is mod) and if they happens to be threadcapping (something like: ""lower the price"" ""because I want to sell my own set and threadcap your post so your would be ignored"") or toxic - reported. Thank you for your understanding <3*"

Paring down the collection and hoping to find a good home for everything :)

Items are not FCFS, are OBO (below asking), and shipping costs are not included. Bundles are convenient and happy to negotiate a reasonable bundle price. It's also generally helpful if messages are clear and actionable (provide ZIP and PayPal in the initial message so I can quote shipping quickly). Unless they are marked as sold, they are still available. Local to SF Bay Area, California.

CONUS shipping preferred, but I can accommodate international shipments at the buyer's expense.

The 7V is BNIB, only opened to inspect it and take pictures. I purchased it from the GB with a PC plate, as well as an additional PCB and flex PC plate, and the black 7V badge.

- Build with Lubed Tealios V2 and GMK Stabs 
- a bit scratch below the usb port (bottom side)
- no oxidation on brass weight
- some oxidation on the brass plate 
- no rgb parts and diffuser so i havent tried the rgb features on the pcb

[Norbaforce Photo Album](https://imgur.com/a/nJi46RW)

\-Norbaforce MKIII PC -- with boxes and both breakout PCB's (for 87u and R2 compatibility)

\-Realforce 87u 10th Anniversary Edition TKL -- with original box and extra keycaps

\- Custom modding by u/ Choobies, Dome swapped to 45g, and lubed with 3203

One of my favorite builds hands down.. This was my first PC build and I wanted to do something very special. I first started with the highly sought after Realforce 87u Anniversary Edition TKL and then swapped the casing (original case, extra keycaps, and box will be included of course) for the Norbaforce Ghost of Chrismas Past Edition Polycarbonate case. I purchased both breaktout PCB's for added flexibility should you want to throw in an RF2 board in there. Leaving no stone unturned, I also had some custom work done by another community member u/ Choobies to replace the 55g domes with 45g domes (harvested from a brand new RF2) and lubed with 3203. The typing feel is just right for me, its light yet tactile and has that deep, thocky sound we all love from topre.

Please see the photo with the sharpie tip, there is the smallest scuff on the forehead of the board. just a surface scratch and can easily be buffed out. The board and internals are flawless otherwise along with the original AE case.

Happy to answer any of your questions, so please let me know!

~~I made a small cutout at the top (b/w the 4th and 5th switch hole) and widened the side mounting cutouts in my futile attempt to convert my tray-mount keyboard to O-ring gasket mount. No effect on the PCB's functionality. My case ended up being a bit too big to hold the gasket-wrapped pcb in place, but the cutouts would actually make the PCB ready for the O-ring conversion e.g. on a Tofu60.

Switch made by myself. This item is not sold anymore as it was limited run. Bsun is manufacturer of yok pandas - its the same yok housing, if you are looking for yok red panda.

|**Switch Couture Electrotype60 (Bifrost Radiant) HHKB Case**|125€ (pp fees and tracked shipping)|145€ (international pp fees and tracked usps shipping)|Ligthly used switch couture case. Has a small crack on top layer near bottom screw (happened during assembly) thus price is cheaper than what I paid (not even including VAT and shipping - total costed around 190€). You can always buy new top layer if small crack bothers you (asked seller). Feet included! Works with hotswap pcb - tested. Sound test after assembling [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7USktI9kYA&t=166s). Can include lubed durock v1 stabs for 12 euro. And for 28 euro more can add gh60 minilla pcb.

A perfect package ready for your expensive custom.|115€|
|**60% QMK/VIA Custom Keyboard with Lubed OG gateron tangerines**|140€ (pp fees and shipping)|158€ (USA USPS tracked and international pp fees) + 45€ for FEDEX|60% QMK VIA Custom Keyboard or Ultimate Keyboard History Keyboard. You may ask me why? Let me tell a story (and specify keyboard's specs along the way). Case is anne pro 2 black - a case of a keyboard, which was a kickstarter of the hobby before it blowed and became mainstream (this keyboard not only blow the hobby but also so many YouTube channels like :3ildcat or minimalistik). Pcb is YD60MQ aka gh60 minilla - gh60 was one of the first pcb that were qmk, of course this the newest type c version, but it holds the name of original reminding where and when qmk and all keyboard customisation on software side started. Switches are probably the most unique of all things mentioned: they are lubed w/krytox 205g0 gateron tangerines v1 - switches that are rare and not sold anymore anywhere - unicorns some would say. On all stabilized keys I soldered hotswap (mill maxed) sockets and hotswap is another thing which made hobby so much more accessible to those who don't want to solder... and that is the end of history lesson :) btw one switch is different and its gateron yellow ink lubed with 205g0 and with tx film on it. So don't wait and purchase this history packed keyboard! +7 euro can add 60% keyboard storage bag (leather like)|120€|

Just to note: its sealed/never opened, but either gmk or vendor made small hole in plastic wrap. I got it like that from manufacturer / vendor. It was never opened by myself, so in that matter its factory sealed and never used.|\-|
|**Space Cables GMK Lazer Coiled Aviator Type-C Cable**|95 € (pp fees and tracked shipping)|\-|Original Space Cables Lazer Cable with legendary strong cable coil, removable aviator from Texas, Space Cables. Paid 25 eur for shipping and VAT fees when was imported to eu if you wonder about pricing.|\-|
|**GMK Lazer Base (sealed)**|180 € (pp fees and tracked shipping)|\-|Paid all VAT and Import fees. Buying this and lazer extras will sell for 240 eur. Really like this set, but I need money for other hobby and have another similar set|\-|

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered/linked to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation thus for trade PM is needed.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-80 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus the one I recommend (FEDEX/DHL) generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster. I recently added an option to choose slow shipping option, but I don't recommend it for expensive items (its like USPS) - choose this for those at your own risk.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct.
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.

   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay (with no refund), but generally no.

\-Norbaforce MKIII PC -- with boxes and both breakout PCB's (for 87u and R2 compatibility)

\-Realforce 87u 10th Anniversary Edition TKL -- with original box and extra keycaps

\- Custom modding by u/ Choobies, Dome swapped to 45g, and lubed with 3203

One of my favorite builds hands down.. This was my first PC build and I wanted to do something very special. I first started with the highly sought after Realforce 87u Anniversary Edition TKL and then swapped the casing (original case, extra keycaps, and box will be included of course) for the Norbaforce Ghost of Chrismas Past Edition Polycarbonate case. I purchased both breaktout PCB's for added flexibility should you want to throw in an RF2 board in there. Leaving no stone unturned, I also had some custom work done by another community member u/ Choobies to replace the 55g domes with 45g domes (harvested from a brand new RF2) and lubed with 3203. The typing feel is just right for me, its light yet tactile and has that deep, thocky sound we all love from topre.

Please see the photo with the sharpie tip, there is the smallest scuff on the forehead of the board. just a surface scratch and can easily be buffed out. The board and internals are flawless otherwise along with the original AE case.

Happy to answer any of your questions, so please let me know!

\*\*No international shipping (for now)\*\*

Local sale is also available if you are local to the Manhattan/ Brooklyn area.

Hi everyone,

I still have some items that I wanted to sell to generate funds for a new hobby.

GMK 9009 R3 (base kit): $230 shipped (sold for $220)

GMK Dracula (base, err! kit, nightmode, deskpad, stickers): $630 shipped. I would possibly split the kit if have enough interest.

TMO-V2 (poly top and poly bottom, brass plate, extra poly plate, extra pcb):  $600 shipped

Jelly Key Zen Pond II: Katsutoshi 6.25u ($90) + Anka 2.25u($70). Take both for $150

Hello everybody,

I am looking to let go of my After to fund another board purchase. It will come with two builds: TKC 62g Tangerines on a brass plate and AEBoards Raeds on an FR4 plate. Both builds lubed. Gaskets applied to the keyboard case. There is a memory foam liner for case dampening, and the FR4 build has plate foam between the plate and the PCB. It will come in the ZT carrying case with extra knobs,  an extra jst cable, an extra daughterboard, and an extra black aluminum full plate. 

Everything above: $675 shipped. 

If you are interested in GMK Bleached or GMK WoB, I have both set up on both of the aforementioned builds. Confirm any interest with me and we can potentially work something out there. I will not sell them alone though, only with the After. 

I’m looking at CONUS only at the moment, apologies. Comment, and then PM. I will take more pictures as well if necessary. Thanks!"

Edit: IFK Rainbow Pastel is spoken for. 

GMK Finer Things is pending.

Hi, I have GMK Finer Things base kit + space bars kit & IFK Pastel Rainbow core kit + Rainbow Mega add on kit for trade.

I am looking for GMK Darling for my Finer Things and KAT Eternal for my IFK Rainbow Pastel.Both have been mounted for less than a week total and not typed on much. No shine.

My priority is trades atm because I realized I don't have any boards in mind for these two sets and would much rather find sets for my other boards. I am opened to selling the kits if I cannot find a trade, so please don't be afraid to send a message asking about that. (400 +shipping for Finer Things and 200 +shipping for Rainbow)

If you have a set that you think would match a maroon Mode65, I will also happily take a look."

Switch made by myself. This item is not sold anymore as it was limited run. Bsun is manufacturer of yok pandas - its the same yok housing, if you are looking for yok red panda.

You may ask me why? Let me tell a story (and specify keyboard's specs along the way). Case is anne pro 2 black - a case of a keyboard, which was a kickstarter of the hobby before it blowed and became mainstream (this keyboard not only blow the hobby but also so many YouTube channels like :3ildcat or minimalistik). Pcb is YD60MQ aka gh60 minilla - gh60 was one of the first pcb that were qmk, of course this the newest type c version, but it holds the name of original reminding where and when qmk and all keyboard customisation on software side started. Switches are probably the most unique of all things mentioned: they are lubed w/krytox 205g0 gateron tangerines v1 - switches that are rare and not sold anymore anywhere - unicorns some would say. On all stabilized keys I soldered hotswap (mill maxed) sockets and hotswap is another thing which made hobby so much more accessible to those who don't want to solder... and that is the end of history lesson :) btw one switch is different and its gateron yellow ink lubed with 205g0 and with tx film on it. So don't wait and purchase this history packed keyboard! +7 euro can add 60% keyboard storage bag (leather like)|120€|
|**GMK Modo Light Numpad (never opened)**|80 € (pp fees and tracked shipping)|95 € (international pp fees and tracked USPS shipping)|GMK Modo Light Numpad (sealed). How it looks with ewhite numpad: [https://imgur.com/a/goZyIkg](https://imgur.com/a/goZyIkg)|\-|
|**GMK Modo Light Aesthetic (never opened)**|65 € (pp fees and tracked shipping)|80 € (international pp fees and tracked USPS shipping)|GMK Modo Light Aesthetic kit. Just to note: its sealed/never opened, but either gmk or vendor made small hole in plastic wrap. I got it like that from manufacturer / vendor. It was never opened by myself, so in that matter its factory sealed and never used.|\-|
|**Space Cables GMK Lazer Cable**|95 € (pp fees and tracked shipping)|\-|Original Space Cables Lazer Cable with legendary strong cable coil, removable aviator from Texas, Space Cables. Paid 25 eur for shipping and VAT fees when was imported to eu if you wonder about pricing.|\-|
|**GMK Lazer Base (sealed)**|180 € (pp fees and tracked shipping)|\-|Paid all VAT and Import fees. Buying this and lazer extras will sell for 240 eur. Really like this set, but I need money for other hobby and have another similar set|\-|

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered/linked to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation thus for trade PM is needed.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-80 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus the one I recommend (FEDEX/DHL) generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster. I recently added an option to choose slow shipping option, but I don't recommend it for expensive items (its like USPS) - choose this for those at your own risk.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct.
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay (with no refund), but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, write something like* **""I have a question, pm""** *and ask it* **PM** *not here .* **All other comments** *which are not refering to PM on post* ***mostly*** *are* **IGNORED** *(or with an instances if commenter is mod) and if they happens to be threadcapping (something like: ""lower the price"" ""because I want to sell my own set and threadcap your post so your would be ignored"") or toxic - reported. Thank you for your understanding <3*"

|Think6.5 V1 Frosted Poly Hotswap|Has GMK retooled stabs (may want to swap or retune, not my best job). Flashed with VIA. Used pretty lightly for a few months. Includes regular brass badge and polycarbonate badge (from giveaway). One thing to note is that the PCB USB-C connection isn't perfect. Moving the board will sometimes lead to the board reconnecting, which can be of an annoyance. I feel like people might be wary of purchasing because of the issue, however, it is a pretty rare occurrence; [here's an example of it happening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9uZ7N-7Obg). If it wasn't apparent, I had to really force it to happen. [Sound test with inks](https://soundcloud.com/junhyukee/think65-gateron-inks)|$400 shipped OBO|

I've used this thing sparingly in my 3-4 keyboard rotation for work over the last year or so. It was a bit of a test build to see how I felt about the whole acrylic aesthetic and whether I'd like properly lubed tactile switches. Neither flavor was for me, so I'm looking to swap the build 1-for-1.

DZ60 with RGB underglow, KBD Fans 'frosted' acrylic case. GMK Laser with Kobe alphas and Blocknet mods (I think it's R1, bought it from here). Stabs lubed with dielectric grease, and Zealios 67g lubed carefully with Tribosys 3204. Laser-themed cable I bought from here (not sure of origin), and one of the official Laser desk mats ([this one](https://mechsandco.com/products/gb-mito-x-mechs-co-cyber-overload-deskmat-collection?variant=34526960091271)).

I'm looking for any build that's at least 65%+ with lubed linears. 
 I'm willing to listen to any offer. If it's allowed here, I'll also pay a little or receive a little money to settle a difference in trade value.

**EDIT**: I don't think I phrased it very clearly, by ""completed"" build I mean I need it to have a keycaps. I'm hoping to plug and play with my trade. 😂"

Hi all,

I've got an assortment of things I'm looking to sell. I no longer have the time to enjoy this hobby as much as I used to, so I'm hoping to pass on what I've collected to those that might be able to enjoy them as they've just been sitting in boxes going unused.

All prices account for shipping. Prices may also be negotiable. Would prefer grouped orders to minimize shipping, so if you're interested in multiple items that would definitely make price negotiation easier.

EDIT: Adjusted prices!!

Hi, looking to sell off my board, switches, and keycaps. Prices negotiable.

&#x200B;

~~The NK65 v2 is used for a couple months. Doesn't come with the original coiled USB-C cable. Comes with NK Stabs. Asking for $140, throwing in the FR4 plate for free.~~ Sold!

~~GMK Laser includes all of the keycaps from the original set, the novelties add-ons, and the hiragana Gaijin set. The Base set was from a previous owner on ebay. The box was wrapped in a layer of tape. The Gaijin and Novelties are new by me, tho. Base set asking for $60, Gaijin $40, Novelties $30~~ Keeping. 

~~My Glorious Pandas (x72 count) came unlubed from Micro Center and I lubed them myself with 205g0 and had clear switch films applied to them. This time I applied just enough lube and got the films on perfectly. They still retain their original tactility and are a lot smoother. Asking like $40 for them.~~ Keeping.

~~My NK Creams (x82 count) were my first ever switches. The lube job on them are great but the films were put on a bit offcenter. Some of them flare out a bit but still dampen the switch under normal use! I'd ask like $40 for.~~ Sold!

&#x200B;

I hope asking prices are fair but I'm negotiable and would rather have these go then sit around pls!"

**Desoldered DZ60 with Durock V2 screw-in stabs - $40 shipped within CONUS**

Close-up : [https://i.imgur.com/FMXs9V6.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/FMXs9V6.jpg)

DZ60 rev 3.0 solder PCB desoldered.

I made a small cutout at the top (b/w the 4th and 5th switch hole) and widened the side mounting cutouts in my futile attempt to convert my tray-mount keyboard to O-ring gasket mount. No effect on the PCB's functionality. My case ended up being a bit too big to hold the gasket-wrapped pcb in place, but the cutouts would actually make the PCB ready for the O-ring conversion e.g. on a Tofu60. If you want to try the conversion, I can include the gasket at no extra charge.

I'll include the durock V2 stabs on it as well. They were lubed and band-aid modded, and currently installed for 2.25 u left shift, split backspace (i.e. no stab), and 2.25u/2.75u split space configuration, but I can take them apart or change them to your desired configuration (though for spacebar, I only have 6.25u stab, which is a common length).

For sale, Rose color winkey Studio Kestra Nue, the most rare color and layout combo of the four options. I’m the original owner and group buy raffle winner and it’s an A stock board. It has a custom brushed finished brass weight since the original polished finish of the weight picked up micro scratches and fingerprints real easily and no matter how careful I was it never looked as good as the rest of the board, so I had it brushed finished. It’s a fine brushed finish meaning it could easily be polished again if a person wanted to do that themselves or have it done. I wouldn’t, it looks way better brushed in my opinion and helps hide any micro scratches from moving it around on your desk and handling it.

It’s built plateless with the optional case foam currently installed. It has H1 switches, lubed with 205g0, black TX films, 67g springs lubed with 105 and all black Durock stabs lubed with 205g0 and XHT-BDZ. Comes with another unused PCB and FR4 plate along with extra gaskets (gaskets are currently installed on the case, not the PCB) and ships in the original case and shipping box.

Also comes with GMK Olivia++ Dark (full base kit plus the extension kit. In bags, not box) since it’s the perfect set for this board and belongs on it. No, I will not sell the Nue without the caps or sell the caps separately, they belong together.

[E-White sunsetter](https://imgur.com/a/s1IH1MF) \- $600

I am in no rush to sell this board and i am not willing to negotiate on the price, so please do not ask. I love this board and i really hate to let it go, but it just does not see the use it used to - and i need to make some room in my collection. there is slight imperfections on the board that can be seen in the photos that happened during shipping. they are not highly noticeable in use, but they are there.

[E-White WKL Prophet](https://imgur.com/a/yJfAB8C) \- $430

Board comes with a brand new PCB and a nylon half plate. There are two small imperfections in the front corners. they are completely unnoticeable in use, and particularly the one on the left side is next to unnoticeable unless specifically looking for it. board is otherwise in perfect condition.

[GMK Bento Base](https://imgur.com/a/ovk9Vm9) \- $275

Slight shine on some of the more used keys. tried to capture this as best i could in the photos provided, also added keys with no shine on them at all for comparison. Will ship in bags as i do not have the original trays for them.

**Green S65 Lite FRL WKL TKL by Not From Sam, built with lubed pewters on FR4 -$270 local/trades**  
Bought from another lovely user on /mm.  Typed on it for 2hours maybe, I love how it looks, but the layout isn't for me. Will come in the green carrying case that it came with (shown in timestamp). In flawless condition, selling below cost.

**Burgundy Alu K80 by Monstargear, built with lubed Boba U4Ts on FR4 with extra brass plate, extra mill-maxed PCB, alu spacer -$350 local/trades**  
Board is technically B-stock due to the color matching between the top case and bottom case being off. There is a small scuff in the top right and the bottom of the keyboard [shown here](https://imgur.com/a/YoqqrAI). It'll come with an extra mill-maxed PCB (first PCB isn't mill-maxed, the Bobas are soldered, both have a 7u spacebar bottom row ANSI layout) and an extra brass plate. It will also come with the alu spacer in order to gasket mount the plate, but I'm out of the adhesive gaskets so you'll have to source your own. Selling way below cost.

Mostly looking to sell, but also interested in trading locally for some GMK/CRP sets. Feel free to ask me any questions and comment before DMing please.

Trying to downgrade a bit and get the mode65. I love this keyboard but I think a 65% is more practical for me.

Jelly Epoch SE w/ L&F Boba U4Ts.

GMK Red Samurai TKL Set I believe with Novelty Set.

Stabs are Durock V2 Holee modded.

I only used Krytox 205g0.

I do have an extra FR4 plate as well.

It is prebuilt with a PC Plate. so no hassle in building it. The only problem with it is that there is a 1 stripped screw on the case making it difficult currently to open but it should be easily removable with you have the right tools since I've done it myself (the screw came stripped).

Other than that, I've only used it for maybe a month or two now. Absolutely love it. Sad to let it go.

Price = $1000USD OBO

Detailed pict : http://imgur.com/gallery/dDBvcr1

If you need more pict / details can dm me. 

RED TGR Alice (B-Stock)

- Build with Lubed Tealios V2 and GMK Stabs 
- a bit scratch below the usb port (bottom side)
- no oxidation on brass weight
- some oxidation on the brass plate 
- no rgb parts and diffuser so i havent tried the rgb features on the pcb

Selling it for $4100 Shipped using DHL

GMMK Pro build with Boba U4T switches and GMK Lux keycap set. 

Bottom half of the case has been painted gold to match the build. Brass plate and knob are on build currently but I'll include the stock black plate and knob.

Greetings fellow enthusiasts,  

&nbsp;

I am looking to sell the well-known Topre keyboard with a few extras that may interest you, and to downsize my collection.

&nbsp;

item | description | condition | price
:--|:--|:--|:--:
~~Leopold FC660C with Biip Extended-2048 Torii & Icono kits~~ | **Keyboard** lubed with Krytox 205g0 & Tribosys 3204 and prepared for Novatouch sliders (that I never bought). Comes with original 45G domes. What you see is what you get. **Torii kit** covers the majority of 60%, 65%, 75%, TKL, 100% keyboards which means HHKB, FC660C, FC980C, RF104U, RF87U, RF86U but not the RF R2 (because there is no spacebar of 6.25U). In excellent condition, used on my FC660C for around 5 weeks. **Icono kit** never used. | Was my work board, but now I work from home due to the pandemic. Used, but in excellent condition. | sold
~~Biip Extended-2048 Base & Icono kits~~ | Topre |  **Base kit** and **Icono kit** never used. | sold
~~x110pcs BKE Ultra Light Domes~~| BKE Ultra Lights, 35G domes, have Sharper/shorter, stiffer, heavier initial bump than the rounded/longer bump on stock 45g. Although they do have all these characteristics are slightly lighter than 45G in overall feel. | The domes are in perfect shape only tried (66 of them) on a FC660C. | sold

If you need extra photos or some information just pm me.

&nbsp;

Prices include PayPal fees but not shipping (if you are from Greece I will pay for shipping).  

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Except for PayPal, I am looking for keysets: GMK Godspeed Columbia, GMK Shoko, GMK Firefly, GMK Dracula, GMK Classic Blue (Blue Base), GMK Strike, GMK Noel, Melgeek MG Ember *Dawn* and other classic sets.

&nbsp;

And last but not least Ultimate Hacking Keyboard v2.

Good afternoon all,

My GMK laser r2 has been sitting in its box since I paid the import fee a few months back. Looking to sell it off to put towards some other life needs.

Also, have the novelties kit.

GMK Laser Cyberdeck : £120 + shipping

GMK Laser Novelties: £40+ shipping

Bundle for £155 + shipping

A strong preference is to ship as a bundle within UK or possible within the EU.

All are still sealed and in original boxes.

Very high quality with nice weight to them, definitely some of the best knob options out there. 18mm diameter and 18mm height with 6mm internal shaft space. Fits to the shaft using a small flat head grub screw, colour-coded to the knob so very hard to see. Polished and rounded top, with embossed knurling around the sides.

**[x3 Plastic keycap storage boxes (same as KineticLabs boxes)](https://imgur.com/84YnjXH)** - All brand new and unused (I use another 3 of these myself for my other keycap sets). Great quality keycap storage boxes that allow either two TKL kits to fit with space to spare, and can happily accomodate larger kits. Identical to the ones sold in the US by KineticLabs. Will come securely packaged in a carboard box to ensure no damage in transit.|***£10 each***|

You can always buy new top layer if small crack bothers you (asked seller). Feet included! Works with hotswap pcb - tested. Sound test after assembling [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7USktI9kYA&t=166s). Can include lubed durock v1 stabs for 12 euro. And for 28 euro more can add gh60 minilla pcb. Then you can buy switches from me posted above and keycaps and you will have full keyboard|110€|

You may ask me why? Let me tell a story (and specify keyboard's specs along the way). Case is anne pro 2 black - a case of a keyboard, which was a kickstarter of the hobby before it blowed and became mainstream (this keyboard not only blow the hobby but also so many YouTube channels like :3ildcat or minimalistik). Pcb is YD60MQ aka gh60 minilla - gh60 was one of the first pcb that were qmk, of course this the newest type c version, but it holds the name of original reminding where and when qmk and all keyboard customisation on software side started. Switches are probably the most unique of all things mentioned: they are lubed w/krytox 205g0 gateron tangerines v1 - switches that are rare and not sold anymore anywhere - unicorns some would say. On all stabilized keys I soldered hotswap (mill maxed) sockets and hotswap is another thing which made hobby so much more accessible to those who don't want to solder... and that is the end of history lesson :) btw one switch is different and its gateron yellow ink lubed with 205g0 and with tx film on it. So don't wait and purchase this history packed keyboard! +7 euro can add 60% keyboard storage bag (leather like)|120€|

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered/linked to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation thus for trade PM is needed.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-80 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus the one I recommend (FEDEX/DHL) generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster. I recently added an option to choose slow shipping option, but I don't recommend it for expensive items (its like USPS) - choose this for those at your own risk.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct.
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay (with no refund), but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, write something like* **""I have a question, pm""** *and ask it* **PM** *not here .* **All other comments** *which are not refering to PM on post* ***mostly*** *are* **IGNORED** *(or with an instances if commenter is mod) and if they happens to be threadcapping (something like: ""lower the price"" ""because I want to sell my own set and threadcap your post so your would be ignored"") or toxic - reported. Thank you for your understanding <3*"

~~Not 100% set on getting rid of this board but I'd like to see my options. If no trade of interest comes in the next week I will most likely build it.~~

~~Looking for a board of similar value, 60%-TKL, WKL preferred when possible, no silver or green, BNIB strongly preferred.~~

Purple on Pink Aviator Cable | This was my trusty cable for almost a year now and I have moved on to new and exciting colorways. USB-A to USB-C. | $50 OBO
~~NK65 Alu + Entry Case~~ | ~~This bundle includes a fully functioning NK65 Alu edition with lubed stabs as well as a NK65 entry edition case with no PCB included. The PCBs are interchangeable if you prefer one over the other I could even switch them before shipping. NK has said they will be restocking NK65 PCBs before the end of the year for $50 so with that you would have 2 complete boards. Both have seen some wear but the Alu is more noticeable, one of the feet is messed up and it has a visible scratch on the front edge. Also the screws that attach the PCB are super stripped but can still be removed with a hex bit.~~ | ~~$100 OBO~~ **SOLD**
mstone Keycap Trays x6 | These are all kinds of scuffed and came that way from Amazon. There are missing magnets  with scratches and chips in the acrylic. However they do work great and I prefered them to JTK trays for their smaller size.

Keyboard bundles:

Note: All boards have been built and several have been rebuilt many times. All items will be sold in working condition. All accessories that came with the order included such as carrying cases, plates, PCB. If they came with stabs, I used them and you will have to supply your own. Will also include a Cannonkeys carrying case to protect during shipping for the 67MKII and Phantom. All of these boards are hotswap PCB's.

* Portico bundle. Mint Portico, carrying case, cable, all the accessories. Used the stabs though. Includes all of my remaining POM Jellys so you can do whatever you want and enjoy that RGB goodness. Go full matching with accents. Go gradient. Whatever your heart desires. $250.00

* ~~KBDFans 67MKII. Rose gold with brass plate. Small mark or nick in the bottom weight in the middle. Brass plate has scratches on it from the switch puller. Includes two sets that I think pair very well with it: PBT Milkman and clone SA Grand Budapest. $225.00~~

* ~~Phantom by Maker Keyboards. Dark blue. This is a B-stock from them, nicks in the bottom left corner exterior. See album above for photo. Includes two plates IIRC its PC and FR4. No caps included in this bundle but I have switches and lube to make this sweeter. This keyboard is basically a Bakeneko65. $225.00~~

Switches I have to throw ~~away~~ with your order: Kailh Speed Golds, Cherry MX Blue, Lychee linears, Tangerines, and Banananana Splits.

The Phantom with L+F Banana Splits on PC plate is fucking GOLDEN."

Hey,

I currently want some extra money to buy a new watch so for that reason I'm selling this GMK set.

I have this keycap set for a while now and since I have multiple keycap sets it has not been used constantly at all and is in a very good condition. There is no shine and the set is the base kit. It's complete with no missing or broken keycaps as you can see on the picture.

Asking **€250 excl. shipping**.
SOLD!

Hello /mm!

Looking to move a couple of boards:

***I WILL ONLY SHIP WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. ANY DMS ASKING FOR INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING WILL BE IGNORED***

Prices exclude shipping. PM for quote.
PayPal Goods & Services only.

NK65 - Aluminum, $195. This is built with moyu black tactile switches and was used as a daily for about three months. Still in excellent condition and comes with case and cable from NovelKeys. Price is firm as this is less than what I paid.

OwLabs Mr Suit - Red - $700 - This is essentially new in box, I opened the box just to verify that it was shipped to me with the wrong layout. Solder PCB, Alu plate. 

I am looking for GMK Metaverse, a 7V pcb, and the PVD black front emblem.

* Blue Alps x118 - 99 blue alps that the previous owner described as 9-9.5/10. They feel nice, but I think 9+/10 is optimistic for these, and I have a batch that feel nicer. I'd say these are closer to 8/10. The other 19 are from an ""8.5""/10 batch, but I'd rate them at 6/10 personally. They will need some work. - $225 shipped for all of them (what I paid for the nicer batch of 99 switches)

To make it easier for buyers:

\- Shipping prices in eu generally are 4-15 euros (depends on various reasons (if it untracked or tracked), how big is the package)

\- Shipping prices to usa/canada generally are 20-70 (depends on various reasons, mostly size and weight affects price exponentially)

\- PRICE<60 € is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € for tracked;

\- 60=<PRICE<100 € (or just generally heavy) is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € - 3.5 € for tracked (unless listed otherwise)

\- PRICE=>100+ € items is sent via tracked/registered mail (unless asked otherwise);

\- Shipping to UK due to new regulations increase by roughly 3-5e (just add 3-5e to current EU price), but priority is EU > UK > Other.

\- abreviations explained (I need them because post does not let to add more letters than it is now): f - filmed; l - lubed; s - spring swapped;

|ITEM|PRICE to EUROPE (Shipping, pp fee incl.)|PRICE to USA, CANADA, UK (Shipping, pp fee incl.)|DESCRIPTION|Local pickup, without shipping and pp fees|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Mountain Dark Deskmat**|60€ (pp fees and tracked shipping)|85€ (international pp fees and tracked usps shipping)|Original deskmat from Halo gb. If you really want can send to US but it will be expensive since deskmats usually weights over 1kg (shipping around 18 euro for me + huge international pp fees).|40€|
|**Taeha Types TX BAG (medium)**|90€ (pp fees and tracked shipping)|105€ (international pp fees and tracked shipping)|Protective case perfect for your expensive custom with taeha types limited edition branding (gb already ended). I love taeha cases and only selling because I am saving for other stuff. There is soft cloth inside.|70€|
|**69x Holy Bsun Red Panda \[Lubed w/Krytox 205G0 and spring swapped to 63.5g slow sprit\] (tactile switches)**|115€ (pp fees and tracked shipping)|130€ (international pp fees and tracked usps shipping)|Halo stem from DROP and housing from Bolsa Supply. Switch made by myself. This item is not sold anymore as it was limited run. Bsun is manufacturer of yok pandas - its the same yok housing, if you are looking for yok red panda. Switches were lubed krytox 205g0 and springs swapped for 63.5 g slow sprit. Sound test after modding: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtvwNAnc-FY)|100€|
|**Switch Couture Electrotype60 (Bifrost Radiant) HHKB Case**|125€ (pp fees and tracked shipping)|145€ (international pp fees and tracked usps shipping)|Ligthly used switch couture case. Has a small crack on top layer near bottom screw (happened during assembly) thus price is cheaper than what I paid (not even including VAT and shipping - total costed around 190€). You can always buy new top layer if small crack bothers you (asked seller). Feet included! Works with hotswap pcb - tested. Sound test after assembling [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7USktI9kYA&t=166s). Can include lubed durock v1 stabs for 12 euro. And for 28 euro more can add gh60 minilla pcb. Then you can buy switches from me posted above and keycaps and you will have full keyboard|110€|
|**98x Mauve Switches \[Lubed w/Krytox 205G0, 0.15mm TX Filmed, Spring Swapped (sprit 63.5 g Slow)\] (linear switches)**|135€ (pp fees and tracked shipping)|155€ (international pp fees and tracked USPS shipping)|98x JWK Mauves that I lubed with krytox 205g0, filmed with tx 0.15mm films and springs swapped to my personally favorite 63.5g slow films. A perfect package ready for your expensive custom.|115€|
|**60% QMK/VIA Custom Keyboard with Lubed OG gateron tangerines**|140€ (pp fees and tracked shipping)|158€ (USA USPS tracked and international pp fees) + 45€ for FEDEX|60% QMK VIA Custom Keyboard or Ultimate Keyboard History Keyboard. You may ask me why? Let me tell a story (and specify keyboard's specs along the way). Case is anne pro 2 black - a case of a keyboard, which was a kickstarter of the hobby before it blowed and became mainstream (this keyboard not only blow the hobby but also so many YouTube channels like :3ildcat or minimalistik). Pcb is YD60MQ aka gh60 minilla - gh60 was one of the first pcb that were qmk, of course this the newest type c version, but it holds the name of original reminding where and when qmk and all keyboard customisation on software side started. Switches are probably the most unique of all things mentioned: they are lubed w/krytox 205g0 gateron tangerines v1 - switches that are rare and not sold anymore anywhere - unicorns some would say. On all stabilized keys I soldered hotswap (mill maxed) sockets and hotswap is another thing which made hobby so much more accessible to those who don't want to solder... and that is the end of history lesson :) btw one switch is different and its gateron yellow ink lubed with 205g0 and with tx film on it. So don't wait and purchase this history packed keyboard! +7 euro can add 60% keyboard storage bag (leather like)|120€|
|**GMK Modo Light Numpad (never opened)**|80 € (pp fees and tracked shipping)|95 € (international pp fees and tracked USPS shipping)|GMK Modo Light Numpad (sealed). How it looks with ewhite numpad: [https://imgur.com/a/goZyIkg](https://imgur.com/a/goZyIkg)|\-|
|**GMK Modo Light Aesthetic (never opened)**|65 € (pp fees and tracked shipping)|80 € (international pp fees and tracked USPS shipping)|GMK Modo Light Aesthetic kit. Just to note: its sealed/never opened, but either gmk or vendor made small hole in plastic wrap. I got it like that from manufacturer / vendor. It was never opened by myself, so in that matter its factory sealed and never used.|\-|
|**Space Cables GMK Lazer Cable**|95 € (pp fees and tracked shipping)|\-|Original Space Cables Lazer Cable with legendary strong cable coil, removable aviator from Texas, Space Cables. Paid 25 eur for shipping and VAT fees when was imported to eu if you wonder about pricing.|\-|
|**GMK Lazer Base (sealed)**|180 € (pp fees and tracked shipping)|\-|Paid all VAT and Import fees. Buying this and lazer extras will sell for 240 eur. Really like this set, but I need money for other hobby and have another similar set|\-|
|**GMK Lazer Extras (sealed)**|70 € (pp fees and tracked shipping)|\-|Paid shipping from united states, all VAT and import fees. Buying this and base will sell for 240 eur|\-|

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered/linked to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation thus for trade PM is needed.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-80 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus the one I recommend (FEDEX/DHL) generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster. I recently added an option to choose slow shipping option, but I don't recommend it for expensive items (its like USPS) - choose this for those at your own risk.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct.
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay (with no refund), but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, write something like* **""I have a question, pm""** *and ask it* **PM** *not here .* **All other comments** *which are not refering to PM on post* ***mostly*** *are* **IGNORED** *(or with an instances if commenter is mod) and if they happens to be threadcapping (something like: ""lower the price"" ""because I want to sell my own set and threadcap your post so your would be ignored"") or toxic - reported. Thank you for your understanding <3*"

Hello!

Getting rid of some stuff I don't need anymore.

**~~110x Lavenders~~** ~~- About 85 of them are lubed and filmed (205g0 + Durock 0.15 films), the other 25 are stock but are taken apart and separated in bags. All springs are bag lubed with 105 oil. Can include enough films to finish the rest of the switches if you want. Mostly looking to sell altogether, but am willing to hear you out. PM me what you want and an offer for it, and we'll sort something out.~~ **~~$95 + shipping~~** **Traded for 68x Glorious Pandas + $60 PayPal**

**67x Durock POMs** \- My first switches, and it shows. A lot of bent pins (they work fine and have been fixed, but don't look the best aesthetically). Can also include 3 more which work but have broken pins (don't ask how). all lubed and filmed (205g0 and Deskeys). Springs bag lubed with 105. **$50 + shipping**

**All White KBDFans Custom Coiled Cable** \- Used for less than a month. Selling because it doesn't match the keycap set I wanted it to match. Perfect condition. Paid $70 + shipping, will sell for **$60 + shipping**

**DSA High Contrast Granite + Icon Mods + Icon Pro Mods/2x DSA 7u PBT Spacebars** \- Used for about a month, PBT so no shine. Selling because I made a terrible financial decision and am replacing them with GMK Frost Witch. Really good quality, no noticeable warping. Includes 2 DSA spacebars, one is light grey and one is light blue, as the set did not come with a 7u spacebar. In the timestamp is a photo of a Vega using the light grey spacebar. If you want, I can also send a picture with the light blue spacebar instead. Just lmk. **$100 + shipping for everything. Lmk if you only want certain things and we can talk about price.**

All prices are mildly negotiable, just let me know what you're thinking and we'll talk it out.

Am willing to do some trades. I am looking for the following (can add PayPal on either end if needed):

**~~Glorious Panda Switches (must be lubed or L+F already. I do not have time to lube anything right now, as evidenced by the 25 stock lavenders in my post)~~**

**JTK Zen Base Set**

**Good Quality Budget Hotswap Boards (under $200)**

**If you have something else you want to trade then hit me up, I'm always willing to consider any offer.**

Comment before PM, no chats please.

Thanks for reading!"

Hi, I have some artisans I'm looking to sell at retail or below (or trade). 


Item | Description | Price
---|---|----
Monstera Masai | Cap ciu (ePBT Soju collab) | $40
Enso Bonsai* | Light (GMK Botanical 2 collab) | $45
Enso Bonsai* | Dark (GMK Botanical 2 collab) | $45
Fraktal Caps Aweigh! | Metal Marvel | $50

*Note: The Bonsai's came with very loose stems. There is an easy, damage-free fix by taking some masking tape and putting it over the stem. I currently have some tape over both of their stems so they can sit on a switch correctly, but I can always remove for whatever reason. Just wanted to be transparent about it :)

I prefer to sell but if you have something cool/cute to trade, I'm always willing to take a look. Also willing to part with the whole bundle for $165 shipped.

Shipping is $5 to CONUS (via USPS priority)

Keyboard bundles:

Note: All boards have been built and several have been rebuilt many times. I did a lot of testing and learning on these. All items will be sold in working condition. All accessories that came with the order included such as carrying cases, plates, PCB. If they came with stabs, I used them and you will have to supply your own. All of these boards are hotswap PCB's.

* Portico bundle. Mint Portico, carrying case, cable, all the accessories. Used the stabs though. Includes all of my remaining POM Jellys so you can do whatever you want and enjoy that RGB goodness. Go full matching with accents. Go gradient. Whatever your heart desires. $300.00

* ~~KBDFans 67MKII. Rose gold with brass plate. Small nick in the bottom weight in the middle. Brass plate has scratches on it from the switch puller. Includes two sets that I think pair very well with it. I say includes but I'm basically throwing them at you. PBT Milkman and clone SA Grand Budapest. $250.00~~

* ~~D60. Purple and black with aluminum plate in HHKB layout. My first gasket keyboard, I tried gaskets on case and gaskets on plate so there's some residue from applying and tearing those strips but otherwise no other remarks about condition. Since I don't want to sell Taro that pairs well with this you get switches instead. I have tons, we'll work something out. Also to sweeten the pot, I'll throw in 5 ml of lube and a switch opener. $250.00~~

* ~~Phantom by Maker Keyboards. Dark blue. This is a B-stock from them, nicks in the bottom left corner exterior. See album above for photo. Includes two plates IIRC its PC and FR4. Like the D60, no caps to include but your pick of switches, lube and switch opener if you want. $250.00~~

JTK trays are not included. But shooooot if you want its $15.00 on top of the rest of the order. Not looking to sell these separately at this time.

* **Percent Canoe** Black with grey plate and weight. Build with lubed 62g Zealios and GMK Screw-Ins. Very good condition. **350€** 

* **Fox Orange TKL** Purple with sky blue alu plate. Build with 67G lubed Zealios and GMK Screw-Ins. Condition is very good but the tolerances were too tight on this board. This results in the underside of the PCB, or the legs of the switches, hitting the case causing weird behaviour. So something isolating has to be put inbetween resulting in the case not closing 100%. So theres a tiny gap between the upper and lower case. This problem is very common on this board and a design flaw. **320€**

Looking to move a couple of boards:

***I WILL ONLY SHIP WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. ANY DMS ASKING FOR INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING WILL BE IGNORED***

Prices exclude shipping. PM for quote.
PayPal Goods & Services only.

NK65 - Aluminum, $195. This is built with moyu black tactile switches and was used as a daily for about three months. Still in excellent condition and comes with case and cable from NovelKeys. Price is firm as this is less than what I paid.

OwLabs Mr Suit - Red - $700 - This is essentially new in box, I opened the box just to verify that it was shipped to me with the wrong layout. It has never been removed from the box. Solder PCB, Alu plate. 

I am looking for GMK Metaverse, either sealed or like new, this is my highest purchase priority right now. 

I am also always looking for a spare 7V PCB, so message me if you have one of those too.

To make it easier for buyers:

\- Shipping prices in eu generally are 4-15 euros (depends on various reasons (if it untracked or tracked), how big is the package)

\- Shipping prices to usa/canada generally are 20-70 (depends on various reasons, mostly size and weight affects price exponentially)

\- PRICE<60 € is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € for tracked;

\- 60=<PRICE<100 € (or just generally heavy) is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € - 3.5 € for tracked (unless listed otherwise)

\- PRICE=>100+ € items is sent via tracked/registered mail (unless asked otherwise);

\- Shipping to UK due to new regulations increase by roughly 3-5e (just add 3-5e to current EU price), but priority is EU > UK > Other.

Switch made by myself. This item is not sold anymore as it was limited run. Bsun is manufacturer of yok pandas - its the same yok housing, if you are looking for yok red panda. Switches were lubed krytox 205g0 and springs swapped for 63.5 g slow sprit. Sound test after modding: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtvwNAnc-FY)|100€|

Has a small crack on top layer near bottom screw (happened during assembly) thus price is cheaper than what I paid (not even including VAT and shipping - total costed around 190€). You can always buy new top layer if small crack bothers you (asked seller). Feet included! Works with hotswap pcb - tested.

You may ask me why? Let me tell a story (and specify keyboard's specs along the way). Case is anne pro 2 black - a case of a keyboard, which was a kickstarter of the hobby before it blowed and became mainstream (this keyboard not only blow the hobby but also so many YouTube channels like :3ildcat or minimalistik). Pcb is YD60MQ aka gh60 minilla - gh60 was one of the first pcb that were qmk, of course this the newest type c version, but it holds the name of original reminding where and when qmk and all keyboard customisation on software side started. Switches are probably the most unique of all things mentioned: they are lubed w/krytox 205g0 gateron tangerines v1 - switches that are rare and not sold anymore anywhere - unicorns some would say. On all stabilized keys I soldered hotswap (mill maxed) sockets and hotswap is another thing which made hobby so much more accessible to those who don't want to solder... and that is the end of history lesson :) btw one switch is different and its gateron yellow ink lubed with 205g0 and with tx film on it. So don't wait and purchase this history packed keyboard! +7 euro can add 60% keyboard storage bag (leather like)|120€|

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered/linked to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation thus for trade PM is needed.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-80 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus the one I recommend (FEDEX/DHL) generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster. I recently added an option to choose slow shipping option, but I don't recommend it for expensive items (its like USPS) - choose this for those at your own risk.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct.
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay (with no refund), but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, write something like* **""I have a question, pm""** *and ask it* **PM** *not here .* **All other comments** *which are not refering to PM on post* ***mostly*** *are* **IGNORED** *(or with an instances if commenter is mod) and if they happens to be threadcapping (something like: ""lower the price"" ""because I want to sell my own set and threadcap your post so your would be ignored"") or toxic - reported. Thank you for your understanding <3*"

Everything about it is pristine, as it was sitting in a closet for the past 30\~ years untouched.

**Boards:**

~~**$230 NK65 Milkshake Edition **- I lubed the stabilizers with white lithium grease and added foam below the PCB to make the board sound deeper. Included are the board with stock stabilizers, a coiled cable, a carrying case, and the original box the board shipped in. I can also include some better stabilizers, switches, and keycaps for an added cost. If you are interested just ask.~~ SOLD for asking. 

**$300 YuiKP prototype 65% board** - I painted this myself to match the 9009 themed keycaps, built with Domikey X Kailh Cyberpunk (pink/purple/blue) switches. Also added foam under the PCB to deaden/deepen the sound a bit. There are a couple of tiny scratches in the paint but unless you're looking for them you won't notice them.

~~**$200 CFTKB Mysterium with custom Acyrlic Case**. Built with 67g Tangerines and TKC Cream stabilizers with black wires.~~ SOLD for asking. 

**$65 The CerealBox** (April fools keyboard). Made out of actual cereal boxes, this keyboard is sure to give you a nice soft typing feel! 

**$400 Savage65 Aquamarine**. Built with Lubed Porcelain Blues and clear Durock stabilizers with gold wires. Brand new, I built it and never used it. I mounted a couple of keycaps just to see how it sounds and feels and it's great. Originally planned to use GMK Laser Synthwave with this board because the legend color matches really well. 



**Keycaps:**

$80 Angry Miao Dancing Cat Keycap set #1. Includes everything needed to cover the Cyberboard or any compatable boards. Came mounted on my Cyberboard, I just removed them and put them into a tray.

$120 Angry Miao Dancing Cat Keycap set #2. Compatable with pretty much any board, brand new.

* No Caps or Num LEDs installed.

**GMMK Pro White Ice ANSI (PLEASE READ BELOW SOLD AS IS): $130 shipped CONUS**

* **ALT-GR Key is broken. The hotswap socket wasnt detecting, so I desoldered the socket to replace it, but accidentally lifted the pads and the trace. So this purchase is really more for someone who wants all the other components of this board, or wants to try fixing the PCB**
* The space switch has a Kalih hotswap socket soldered in when I replaced the original GMMK socket as it wouldnt hold switches.
* AVX Works FR4 Plate with gaskets from board added to it.
* Polycarb plate
* Original box and accessories (Alu plate version.)
* Black knob included with original silver one.
* PE Foam from packaging cut for PCB
* Zip N Fit shelf liner case foam included as well if you prefer that over the original."

~~The gmk black lotus base set mods are the closest match to the color of the back of the no 2 from what I have seen because the color is not purple it is really magenta so sets like gmk first love, gmk purple night, and gmk lavender would probably not match that well.

Hello /mm!

Looking to move a couple of boards:

***I WILL ONLY SHIP WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. ANY DMS ASKING FOR INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING WILL BE IGNORED***

Prices exclude shipping. PM for quote.

NK65 - Aluminum, $195. This is built with moyu black tactile switches and was used as a daily for about three months. Still in excellent condition and comes with case and cable from NovelKeys. Price is firm as this is less than what I paid.

OwLabs Mr Suit - Red - $700 - This is essentially new in box, I opened the box just to verify that it was shipped to me with the wrong layout. It has never been removed from the box. Solder PCB, Alu plate. Also open to local trades (45342) for high end 75% or TKL boards. I do not want a Jelly and I already own a 7V.

Let me know what you have!

To make it easier for buyers:

\- Shipping prices in eu generally are 4-15 euros (depends on various reasons (if it untracked or tracked), how big is the package)

\- Shipping prices to usa/canada generally are 20-70 (depends on various reasons, mostly size and weight affects price exponentially)

\- PRICE<60 € is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € for tracked;

\- 60=<PRICE<100 € (or just generally heavy) is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € - 3.5 € for tracked (unless listed otherwise)

\- PRICE=>100+ € items is sent via tracked/registered mail (unless asked otherwise);

\- Shipping to UK due to new regulations increase by roughly 3-5e (just add 3-5e to current EU price), but priority is EU > UK > Other.

Has a small crack on top layer near bottom screw (happened during assembly) thus price is cheaper than what I paid (not even including VAT and shipping - total costed around 190€).

You may ask me why? Let me tell a story (and specify keyboard's specs along the way). Case is anne pro 2 black - a case of a keyboard, which was a kickstarter of the hobby before it blowed and became mainstream (this keyboard not only blow the hobby but also so many YouTube channels like :3ildcat or minimalistik). Pcb is YD60MQ aka gh60 minilla - gh60 was one of the first pcb that were qmk, of course this the newest type c version, but it holds the name of original reminding where and when qmk and all keyboard customisation on software side started. Switches are probably the most unique of all things mentioned: they are lubed w/krytox 205g0 gateron tangerines v1 - switches that are rare and not sold anymore anywhere - unicorns some would say. On all stabilized keys I soldered hotswap (mill maxed) sockets and hotswap is another thing which made hobby so much more accessible to those who don't want to solder... and that is the end of history lesson :) btw one switch is different and its gateron yellow ink lubed with 205g0 and with tx film on it. So don't wait and purchase this history packed keyboard! +7 euro can add 60% keyboard storage bag (leather like)|120€|
|**~~GMK WOB 2019 Version (in og plastic packaging) \[SOLD\]~~**|~~180€ (pp fees and tracked shipping)~~|~~200€ (USA USPS tracked and pp fees) + 60€ for FEDEX~~|~~Bought in 2019 with original plastic tray VAT and DUTY paid. Just opened, tested for a few weeks (I guess shine is not noticable from such usage), thorougly cleaned after and unused ones sitting in a tray while cleaned ones in a bag. Bought similar set GMK Burgundy, so there is no big need for wob thus selling. Plastic tray is solid, paper banderolle has a little bit of wear where bar-code sticker was. Can send to UK, but its 200 euro, since both shipping price and especially pp fees (we really need to find new platform pp is crazy with its  new international price cuts) are really bad as of USA, just that it delivers faster. Can be easily paired with the keyboard listed above - because its leds south faced~~|~~160€~~|

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered/linked to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation thus for trade PM is needed.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-80 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus the one I recommend (FEDEX/DHL) generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster. I recently added an option to choose slow shipping option, but I don't recommend it for expensive items (its like USPS) - choose this for those at your own risk.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct.
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay (with no refund), but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, write something like* **""I have a question, pm""** *and ask it* **PM** *not here .* **All other comments** *which are not refering to PM on post* ***mostly*** *are* **IGNORED** *(or with an instances if commenter is mod) and if they happens to be threadcapping (something like: ""lower the price"" ""because I want to sell my own set and threadcap your post so your would be ignored"") or toxic - reported. Thank you for your understanding <3*"

Hello Everyone!

Today i’m letting go of my Gmk classic blue regular base kit! A few things to note I used it for about 2 months daily so it’s starting to see some shine on the QWER keys and the ASD keys which is why im letting it go for what i got it for in extras! 140$ Shipped Conus only! PENDING SOLD

Next up I also have 2 CYSM Booo Caps! The Raed boo has never been mounted and the white rabbit boo has also not been mounted. The only thing is that the white rabbit boo was shipped to me with the wrong authenticity card by the previous owner. I’m looking for 40$ shipped for the raed boo and 30$ shipped for the white rabbit boo, or alternatively you can have both for $60 shipped Conus only!

Hello. Selling things I don't want and/or have no use for anymore in my collection for money. You know how it is. I'm local to 92802 if you're available for local pickup, and am only shipping to CONUS at this time. Prices listed are always up for negotiation/OBO, and I'm always open to any offers so don't be afraid to just ask. **I really want to downsize my collection and let go of everything I list in the interest of money & space.** Prices include shipping/fees already and if it doesn't say sold, it's still up for grabs. Comment before PMing me please, and thanks.

Hi mechmarket today I'm here to offload some more unused stuff, just doing some cleaning in preparation for some GB stuff coming this month. My prices are negotiable and includes shipping to CONUS, I'm not really looking to ship anywhere outside of NA right now so sorry about that. Not really looking to split anything, ty. If anything is sold it will be crossed out. I'm local to 95131/95035.

R1 Basketweave ($120): This thing has all the diodes and encoder and stuff soldered on it so it's good to go for your own build. I'm selling this because both the AVA and Meridian is coming and I don't really need a 3rd Alice/Arisu board. It has 2 knobs in it, an alu one and a 3d printed one included as well as a plate. There is a GB going on for this board so just pointing that out there. SOLD

GMK Belafonte ($180): Base + Novelties + Spacebars, I was going to keep it as a gift for a close friend of mine but he kinda got out of the keyboard game so it is what it is. SOLD

GMK Godspeed Columbia ($140): Base + Novelties, used it for a bit and it didn't really work in my setup all that well so again it is what it is.

GMK Nautilus R1 (180): Base only, not to be confused with the R2 base kit, it's a chonky base kit ngl. Used it for a bit and I found out that I don't really like Navy all that well. SOLD TO A FRIEND

EDIT: I don’t know how to cross stuff out on mobile"

Good day MM

GMK Boneyard + Novelties - Opened and mounted for a few minutes. No shine, perfect condition. Really realizing I am more a PBT person. Will ship in original box. **$240 shipped**

I have had a bunch of gaskets made based on the Vega and Think V2 gaskets... I was having trouble finding these easily. They are longer but the same width and thickness so can be cut to size. Same backing as other gaskets and same poron material. [Reference](https://imgur.com/a/B3Alhyv)

Disclaimer: They will probably fit other boards too but I have only tried on these two.

Selling these in sets of 10 for $10 plus $3 for shipping so $13 total. Only CONUS for now but happy to discuss international if there is a need.

All are OBO... shoot me an offer!

All shipping is CONUS unless discussed. Please don't be afraid to make offers. Please comment then PM if you are interested.

Hello /mm!

Looking to move a couple of boards:

***I WILL ONLY SHIP WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. ANY DMS ASKING FOR INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING WILL BE IGNORED***

NK65 - Aluminum, $195. This is built with moyu black tactile switches and was used as a daily for about three months. Still in excellent condition and comes with case and cable from NovelKeys. Price is firm as this is less than what I paid.

OwLabs Mr Suit - Red - this is essentially new in box, I opened the box just to verify that it was shipped to me with the wrong layout. It has never been removed from the box. That experience has kind of soured me on building this board so I'm looking to either trade it (local to 45342) for a WKL red Mr. Suit, but I’ll take a look at other high quality TKL or (preferably) 75% boards or sell it for $700 so I can buy the WKL aftermarket. Comes with the owl stabs, rainbow artisan, solder PCB and aluminum plate. **I will not do a shipped trade, only local.**

Let me know what you have! As far as boards to trade for, I am very open. I've not got my heart set on anything though I do already own a 7V. 

I'm also always interested in the following:


7V solder pcb


GMK Metaverse base


Comment before PM and all that jazz. Thanks for looking!"

To make it easier for buyers:

\- Shipping prices in eu generally are 4-15 euros (depends on various reasons (if it untracked or tracked), how big is the package)

\- Shipping prices to usa/canada generally are 20-70 (depends on various reasons, mostly size and weight affects price exponentially)

\- PRICE<60 € is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € for tracked;

\- 60=<PRICE<100 € (or just generally heavy) is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € - 3.5 € for tracked (unless listed otherwise)

\- PRICE=>100+ € items is sent via tracked/registered mail (unless asked otherwise);

\- Shipping to UK due to new regulations increase by roughly 3-5e (just add 3-5e to current EU price), but priority is EU > UK > Other.

You may ask me why? Let me tell a story (and specify keyboard's specs along the way). Case is anne pro 2 black - a case of a keyboard, which was a kickstarter of the hobby before it blowed and became mainstream (this keyboard not only blow the hobby but also so many YouTube channels like :3ildcat or minimalistik). Pcb is YD60MQ aka gh60 minilla - gh60 was one of the first pcb that were qmk, of course this the newest type c version, but it holds the name of original reminding where and when qmk and all keyboard customisation on software side started. Switches are probably the most unique of all things mentioned: they are lubed w/krytox 205g0 gateron tangerines v1 - switches that are rare and not sold anymore anywhere - unicorns some would say. On all stabilized keys I soldered hotswap (mill maxed) sockets and hotswap is another thing which made hobby so much more accessible to those who don't want to solder... and that is the end of history lesson :) btw one switch is different and its gateron yellow ink lubed with 205g0 and with tx film on it. So don't wait and purchase this history packed keyboard!|120€|
|**GMK WOB 2019 Version (in og plastic packaging)**|180€ (pp fees and tracked shipping)|200€ (USA USPS tracked and pp fees) + 60€ for FEDEX|Bought in 2019 with original plastic tray VAT and DUTY paid. Just opened, tested for a few weeks (I guess shine is not noticable from such usage), thorougly cleaned after and unused ones sitting in a tray while cleaned ones in a bag. Bought similar set GMK Burgundy, so there is no big need for wob thus selling. Plastic tray is solid, paper banderolle has a little bit of wear where bar-code sticker was. Can send to UK, but its 200 euro, since both shipping price and especially pp fees (we really need to find new platform pp is crazy with its  new international price cuts) are really bad as of USA, just that it delivers faster.|160€|

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered/linked to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation thus for trade PM is needed.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-80 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus the one I recommend (FEDEX/DHL) generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster. I recently added an option to choose slow shipping option, but I don't recommend it for expensive items (its like USPS) - choose this for those at your own risk.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct.
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay (with no refund), but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, write something like* **""I have a question, pm""** *and ask it* **PM** *not here .* **All other comments** *which are not refering to PM on post* ***mostly*** *are* **IGNORED** *(or with an instances if commenter is mod) and if they happens to be threadcapping (something like: ""lower the price"" ""because I want to sell my own set and threadcap your post so your would be ignored"") or toxic - reported. Thank you for your understanding <3*"

Willing to sell as a bundle, with $120 OBO for the board and $80 OBO for the caps. Will include the extra GMK  keycaps as well as the original Leopold keycaps if you want.|$200, OBO|YES|

Typing test with different switches (durock poms) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6d0-_UNWDQ), DM me for another typing test sound file with the mauves inside the build.

I got this Bakeneko60 Hotswap off CannonKeys back around June 11th, as well as the GMK Lasers. I've used it on and off since June testing a few different switches. I can't seem to get used to the 60% format so I will be returning to a 65% or a tkl keeb. There are no scratches on the case nor any defects and all hot-swap sockets function perfectly. I am the original owner of the entire build and I paid around $340 USD plus shipping fees for the original build myself so I'm looking to just make back a portion of it.

Hey-hey, MM!

My monthly trades/selling post! Just like every time, I'm just a man-boy standing in front of the faceless void of a community forum, asking them to trade with him.

# HAVES:

Below is this month's list of the info for the artisans I have *(shipping isn't included)*.

Artkey/Jelly Key/Keypora/Lats all have authenticity cards and anything that came in a rigid case (Jelly Key, Clackeys, etc) will come with that, too.

If it has a price, it's ***also open for trades***. Happy to do n:1 or top up with paypal if that's how it shakes out. Happy to provide pics of caps in better lighting / butts upon request.

Also, I've had these GMK Laser sets gathering dust. I've never opened them, but I placed their orders when I got into the hobby, before I realized how much I preferred backlit caps. Hoping these get to a good home!

Good day MM

~~I have a once-built Vertigo grey/white up for sale. Flawless as far as I can tell... no blemishes. Includes 3 PCBs (One had missing diodes but I resoldered and tested) - One is millmaxed - One stock. Also includes alu and PC plates and 2x daughter boards and original case. Sounds good and feel is consistent...  only built up to check everything. Please ask any questions in PM.~~ **~~How about $450~~**  **SOLD**

GMK Boneyard + Novelties - Opened and mounted for a few minutes. No shine, perfect condition. Really realizing I am more a PBT person.  Will ship in original box. **$260 shipped**

I have had a bunch of gaskets made based on the Vega and Think V2 gaskets... I was having trouble finding these easily. They are longer but the same width and thickness so can be cut to size. Same backing as other gaskets and same poron material. [Reference](https://imgur.com/a/B3Alhyv)

Disclaimer: They will probably fit other boards too but I have only tried on these two.

Selling these in sets of 10 for $10 plus $3 for shipping so $13 total. Only CONUS for now but happy to discuss international if there is a need.

All are OBO... shoot me an offer!

All shipping is CONUS unless discussed. Please don't be afraid to make offers. Please comment then PM if you are interested.

One weight screw is missing as this was how I received it. Other than that, it's in great condition besides the brass weight aging. Haven't really used this build and I will include the brass plate as well. Total build costed \~$460.|
|Tofu65 Burgundy Kit|$130 + shipping|Has the DZ65 RGB PCB (purple) with Durock v1 stabs lubed and aluminum plate. The anodization on the left side has worn to a pinkish color but other then that it is in good condition. I added orings and didn't add the middle screws but I can add if needed.|
|Maja Grey (Feeler) Kit|$400 + shipping|Built with Durock v1 stabs(purple) and will come with a red POM plate from GreenDoorGeeks, original brass plate, original foam, and an extra hotswap pcb. I also added orings between plate and top case. Only thing to note is the feet will probably need to be replaced cause they didn't design cutouts for the feet to stay in place, so my feet wore over time and lost it's stickiness as I would move it around my desk. Everything else is in excellent condition.|
|GMK Laser|$180 shipped|BNIB/Sealed Gaijin + Blocknet + Spacebar kit. Will cost over $200 if bought through Drop with their taxes.|

Hello! Here is some stuff I got on sale because I probably will never be using them again. I accept payment by Paypal or IBAN bank transfers.  Priority is on NL buyers first, then it depends on whether you buy multiple items.

I will ship to the EU. Outside the EU depends on the country, but VAT is for the buyer. All prices are excluding shipping costs. Sending without insurance is the risk of the buyer. I can ship in the next few days, but around weekend is a very busy time for me, so most likely it will be beginning next week if not in the coming days.

Please let me know if you need additional information or pictures, I'll gladly provide them.

Also, please comment below before you send a DM. No chat requests please.

**KBDfans D45  | 275 EUR**

A somewhat larger than 40% e-grey board with macro keys on the left side and a brass weight. Very unique. It actually looks very nice and it looked like it could've been my favorite board, but the layout is just too wide for me. I'm now so used to the Planck now.

**Mark65 | 240 EUR**

White frosted PC case with black aluminium plate. The board has some lube spots, but it can be cleared with a little bit of isopropyl alcohol (sorry, I don't have it around). The keyboard actually looks very nice, but the whole group buy got a sour aftertaste, so everytime I looked at it, I couldn't get over the fact that it took almost a year longer plus I had to pay extra because of Brexit.

**NK65 Milkshake | 240 EUR**

New, only opened to check uit contents and see if every key works. It's the NK65 Milshake edition with the Cherry Milkshake keycaps, pink cable and NK keyboard cover. Bought this for my partner, but wasn't into the fruits on the backside.

**Epomaker GX68XS | 70 EUR**

Wireless keyboard from Epomaker. Complete with their alternate stabs as well as keycaps (split spacebars and Mac-keycaps), but  the cable is lost somewhere, so I don't have that one. Used for a few months as my first hot-swappable keyboard. Good memories and quite a nice keyboard to type on, but now I have moved on. I cleaned the board and still looks good, so at least there are no hairs between them!

**Epomaker AK84 | 85 EUR** SOLD

Epomaker AK84s wireless keyboard. White aluminium frame with black/white/red keycaps. Chocolate Mechanical Red switches. Only used once to check out whether all the keys are working or not. Though it would be nice to have bluetooth keyboard, but I just got a nice!nano, so I'm trying to make a different keyboard wireless.

**Epomaker GK2 SIlicone keycaps | 45 EUR**

Green gray orange. Only used them for about 10 minutes and didn't like the soft feel of the keycaps. Full Size ANSI set. See [https://epomaker.com/products/epomaker-silicone-gk2-keycap-set](https://epomaker.com/products/epomaker-silicone-gk2-keycap-set).

**SA Ice Caps R3 ortholinear | 55 EUR**

Only used for a month, but got them 2nd hand from somebody on mechmarket. I used them not a lot, not sure what previous owner did,  but it still looks nice.

**GMK Yeti clone with katakana | 30 EUR**

Bought at Aliexpress. Clone quality. It said on the box that it is double shot, but clearly it's not. It has all the keys a standard clone has. Only used less than an hour in total. These are only keycaps, so you don't get the Anne Pro that's depicted in the picture. I only used it for a day and found the gradient + katakana subs a bit too busy for what my usual taste is.

**Zilents 67g 80x lubed | 95 EUR** SOLD

Silent tactiles lubed with 3203. I bought them already lubed from mechmarket, so I think I couldn't have done it better. For some reason I don't really like these, but I think I'm very specific with my tactile switches. Never really typed on them as I switched back to linear. Not sure how much the previous owner typed on it.

**Red-black aviator cable | 20 EUR**

Non-coiled. Not really sure how long, but as you can see from the photo it's around 1-1.5m I think. I can measure it for you if you like. It's USB-A to USB-C."

Note that I cannot be responsible for shipment issues after handling the items over to the courier.

Hello, back with another post! Getting closer to leaving the hobby, so I have some stuff to sell off.

Only shipping to USA addresses at the moment. **The only trade offer I'm taking is anything involving WoB R0/R5.** All prices include **USPS Priority Mail** shipping costs unless otherwise stated. Please feel free to offer if it means that these things get out of my hands and into yours.

**KEYCAPS PICTURED ON ANY BOARD I LIST IN THIS POST ARE NOT FOR SALE UNLESS EXPLICITLY STATED OTHERWISE**

**NO LOCAL MEETUPS.** The last few times I've listed for local meetups, I've gotten people that can't look up my ZIP code and think I'm in a different part of the state than I actually am. All of those messages have just wasted my time, so unless you're willing to show up at my doorstep, no meetups.

Item|Details|Price|Available
:--|:--|:--|:--
Duck Orion v3 | silver WKL, currently built with 65g MX Clears on stainless steel plate with an h87a PCB. board contains internal brass weight as well. **KEYCAPS NOT INCLUDED.** also includes aluminum full and FR-4 half plate as well as two original PCBs. Case has defects that aren't that visible during normal use. the two original PCBs were soldered/desoldered by previous owner, and all I've done is confirm that they were in the box when I originally bought the board. I can't speak to the quality of the desolder job on either PCB as I haven't looked at them closely. **Price WAY LOWER than what I paid originally**. I'm pretty sure this is under retail value for everything considering that the board is built. **Shipping kinda hard to negotiate for this given the sheer weight of the board.** | $625 shipped | yes!
o-ring mount Tofu | green case, built with Holy Pandas on aluminum. This is slightly different than any other ""o-ring mount"" Tofu you might see listed because this uses a merro60 PCB, which simply has [large enough holes](https://i.imgur.com/a6zco37.jpeg) to not require removing the standoffs from the Tofu at all. board is dank, but maybe someone else will enjoy this more than me as it's been sitting in a drawer ever since it was built. **NOT SELLING THE PCB ALONE.** Please don't tell me that I can just get a DZ60 to replace it because that'd just require de-soldering the whole thing; that's mildly disrespectful. | ~~$160 shipped~~ | **SOLD FOR $150 SHIPPED**
Raeds x140 | lubed with GS2 and spring-swapped to TX 70g 16mm. These are pretty cool switches but I'm no longer using these in any builds. a large majority (around 100) have been previously soldered and cleanly desoldered using an SS-02. I'm willing to break up into two batches of 70 switches if for some reason you're really not interested in the full lot | $130 shipped for entire quantity, $65 shipped for 70 switches | yes!

**PLEASE INCLUDE AN OFFER OR SOMETHING WITH YOUR PM IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY MY ASKING PRICE. IT SIMPLY WASTES MY TIME AND YOURS IF YOU ONLY TELL ME THAT YOU WANT THE ITEM.**

Priority for responding to offers will be as follows:

 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing all items for asking price (will give discount for purchasing all items listed here because holy moly that means you have money)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any bundle  for asking price (will give discount accordingly)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing either keyboard for asking price

Outside of the listed conditions, I'll check based on when you comment **and** PM. The PM is absolutely necessary for the sale of these items. Since I've had this happen before, if there are two people interested in the same item, but one is willing to pay no questions asked while the other has questions or wants to see more pics, I'm 100% selling to the person who will pay no questions asked. Requests for additional pictures will also take longer than you think, so please consider that when trying to secure an item.

Please understand that if you as a buyer and I agree on a price and you back out of the purchase right after I send the invoice, I will refuse to sell anything to you in the future (yes, that includes if you offer me something like $300 on something that I'm selling for much less). 

 **Do not use the chat function**, I honestly don't know how you are taken to the chat function when the bot's verification post gives you a link to PM sellers. I will ignore you and you won't be in consideration for anything until you send me a PM. I will also ignore you if you do not comment before sending a PM.

If I don't respond, it's likely because I'm just busy doing other things. I will get to all messages accompanying comments in a timely manner. Thanks for checking out the post."

Evening! Will be splitting up the collection. Some guidelines will go into effect when selling to make things are easier for me to ship and make this process doable.

1.) If I have Ramas set as a (set) then they will be sold as a set. Will not be splitting up.

2.) If you are buying (single) Rama keycaps, I will be more inclined to sell to you if interested in purchasing two or more keycaps.

(PRICES ARE SET BUT MAKE AN OFFER)


Outside of US buyers!

I will consider outside of the US buyers if they are purchasing a decent size bundle.

Thanks for looking!

**Please do NOT use the new chat feature!!** Chat is the thing on the BOTTOM-right. I'm mainly on mobile and chat doesn't work on mobile so please use the old messaging system on the TOP-right!

* **Percent Canoe** Black with grey plate and weight. Build with lubed 62g Zealios and GMK Screw-Ins. Very good condition. **350€** 

* **Fox Orange TKL** Purple with sky blue alu plate. Build with 67G lubed Zealios and GMK Screw-Ins. Condition is very good but the tolerances were too tight on this board. This results in the underside of the PCB, or the legs of the switches, hitting the case causing weird behaviour. So something isolating has to be put inbetween resulting in the case not closing 100%. So theres a tiny gap between the upper and lower case. This problem is very common on this board and a design flaw. **320€**

I am not looking to ship outside of that, sorry. Please comment before sending PM, no chats, and PayPal only. Transactions will be done via invoice including G&S fees on my end.

Keycap set does NOT come with original tray, it will be shipped in a bag as I do not have the tray myself. The set does in fact have shine, and I tried to capture it the best I could and included some pristine keys to compare them with. The 6.25u space bar has pretty substantial shine, but the 7u is fine. The more commonly used alphas (ie. vowels, gaming keys) have pretty good shine on them, while other lesser used alphas have little to none.

Hi, with this post I'm listing one of my last mech boards for sale. the SP-111 is, as stated in the title, finished in e-white and has a millmaxed pcb (which includes soldered white indicator LEDs). It is in excellent condition, but it does one have minor factory defect near the arrow cluster (as seen in the imgur album). This however is not noticeable with the keycaps on. The plate has some brass tarnishing. Will come with a set of Stupidfish plate and case foam too!

**~~Would like 520eur excl. shipping for just the sp-111.~~**

Preferably I'd sell the board with Crimson Cadet included. This concerns just the base kit and it does have some shine, especially on the gamer keys. I will be including the white spacebar kit from an ePBT set I had lying around so you can mount the keys exactly as I have done. The set will be shipped in bags.

**~~Would like 210eur excl. shipping for just the GMK crimson cadet base kit.~~**

If you're willling to buy both items as a package it will also come with the stabilizers (durock v1's). The package would cost you **710eur excl. shipping.** I'm willing to ship overseas as long as you accept any risks that accompany that (although I always ship with UPS express saver or a similar service and I've yet to experience any mishaps).

**Both items sold**"

Hello there, hope you're all doing great !

I'm selling a part of my collection, uncluding some rare gems that I took good care of.

Some of the boards, including the KMAC were a dream, especially in this color, but I'm at a point where I only kept them for the sake of collecting and not being trully passionate about.

I dreamt about them, but now the dream is ""over"" and I want to pass them to people that will take

care of them as much as I did.

[~~KMAC Happy HHKB Titan grey~~](https://imgur.com/YlHvyBG)  ~~: Probably one of the rarest and coolest 60% ever, at this point it's a piece of keyboard history more than an actual keyboard, almost flawless (small scratch in the back, hard to capture), build with a full alu plate and vintage black 62g (not the best batch) lubed with Krytox 3204.

To make it easier for buyers:

\- Shipping prices in eu generally are 4-15 euros (depends on various reasons (if it untracked or tracked), how big is the package)

\- Shipping prices to usa/canada generally are 20-70 (depends on various reasons, mostly size and weight affects price exponentially)

\- PRICE<60 € is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € for tracked;

\- 60=<PRICE<100 € (or just generally heavy) is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € - 3.5 € for tracked (unless listed otherwise)

\- PRICE=>100+ € items is sent via tracked/registered mail (unless asked otherwise);

\- Shipping to UK due to new regulations increase by roughly 3-5e (just add 3-5e to current EU price), but priority is EU > UK > Other.

Prioritising selling all at once, but write to me if you want to buy 2 or less may we find a solution (because shipping is expensive in my country for such a small item). Maybe to save a bit we could do direct bank transfer in that case - it is not safe as pp, but it can make buying less than 3 spacebar possible~~|~~-~~|

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered/linked to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation thus for trade PM is needed.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-80 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus the one I recommend (FEDEX/DHL) generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster. I recently added an option to choose slow shipping option, but I don't recommend it for expensive items (its like USPS) - choose this for those at your own risk.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct.
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay (with no refund), but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, write something like* **""I have a question, pm""** *and ask it* **PM** *not here .* **All other comments** *which are not refering to PM on post* ***mostly*** *are* **IGNORED** *(or with an instances if commenter is mod) and if they happens to be threadcapping (something like: ""lower the price"" ""because I want to sell my own set and threadcap your post so your would be ignored"") or toxic - reported. Thank you for your understanding <3*"

Hey MM,

Today I'm letting go of my grail. This is a beautiful board that I picked up from Novelkeys when the extras ran a few months back. I wouldn't want to get rid of it, but irl needs take priority.

It comes built with L+F Zaku switches on the PC flex plate, so it's quite bouncy and sounds incredible. The PCB has been tape modded and I added polyfill in the case. The result is an incredibly clean and clacky sound. The F row has some L+F Aquakings 67g switches as I ran out of Zakus, but that sounds awesome too.

Asking for **$900 shipped OBO**. Keycaps not included, but we can talk. Has two slight scuffs on the top left and a very slight scuff on the bottom right .which I'll show in the timestamp and some slight scratches on the stainless steel back, but they're minor and the board is in excellent condition. Never really used it often, but it was in rotation here and there. Comes with an extra aluminum plate. If you have any trades with boards that are within the same range, let me know.

Also looking to trade for or buy a charcoal Ikki68 Aurora.

Has been modded by sandwiching the pcb screws with silicone o-rings for a bouncier feel. Only screwed in on 4 corner posts. Completely full disclosure: I have two dogs and have tried my absolute darndest to remove all stray dog hairs, but some may remain. Also, this is the first ever keyboard I've built so don't expect all the stabs to be expertly balanced :') Used consistently for about 2.5 months. | ~~$225 shipped~~ Sold to /u/k112l

If you need more pict / details can dm me. 

RED TGR Alice (B-Stock) 
- The B stock come due of the color difference between the top case and bottom case (top is a bit brighter and bottom is darker) but you won't see much difference when you see it with your own eyes 

- Build with Lubed Tealios V2 and GMK Stabs 
- no scratches or dent on the case
- no oxidation on brass weight
- some oxidation on the brass plate 
- no rgb parts and diffuser so i havent tried the rgb features on the pcb

Selling it for SOLD  Shipped using Fedex / DHL 
(If you think the price us not right, it can be discussed through dm)

Im opening to other offers as well but i will give priority selling it to paypal.

If you have questions about the details and others do let me know
