Hey Everyone!!!

I have some really nice items today that I'm interested in trading. To be honest, I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for in terms of other boards so let me know what you have!

**~~Bauer~~** ~~- Gray top, brass plate and bottom. Unbuilt. Comes with extra pcb and plate. It looks built in a couple of the pictures but all I did was place some switches into the plate and put caps on to get a feel for how it sounded and felt without the pcb or being built at all. Orig packaging.~~

**~~Unikorn~~** ~~- Silver. Brass plate and desoldered pcb but its very clean. Will include an extra brass plate as well. Small nick on the bottom left that I tried to picture and a very small amount of patina starting on the weight but otherwise very nice. Orig packaging.~~

**~~Grid 600~~** ~~- Black. 1up HSE pcb and an Instant60 pcb. Purple press module. I will be keeping the flash module. Clean condition. No major flaws that I can see but can take more pictures if necessary. Orig packaging. Includes adapters for usb-c and a.~~

**~~Satisfaction 75~~** ~~- Cloud white. Brand new condition. Never built. Comes with 3 pcb's, 1 brass plate and 2 fr4 plates, 3 encoders, 3 OLED screens, silver and gold knobs, extra blank weight with no engravings. (Sorry Rama knob was already sold earlier today). Orig packaging.~~

**~~Think 6.5~~** \~~- Black PC edition. Brand new condition. Never built. Comes with 2 solder pcbs, gold weight and badge. I also have a sealed full set of all the badge colors. Orig packaging.~~

**~~Epbt Kuro Shiro~~** ~~- Excellent condition and comes with the following kits (base, japanese mods, number pad, plank).~~

&#x200B;

I'm def looking for ~~GMK~~ **~~Nines~~**~~, GMK~~ **~~Violet~~** **~~Tendencies~~**~~, GMK~~ **~~Modern~~** **~~Dolch~~** as far as keysets.

Also looking for a **Kyuu pcb and an extra plate if you have it (but will settle for the pcb :))**.

And lastly, some 62-67g springs.

&#x200B;

Look forward to hearing what you have for a trade. Have a great day everyone!

As always, you can hit me up on discord also at DoCallMeKing#6341.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Just so everyone doesn't think I'm ignoring them since the floodgates are now open, it will take me some time to go through all the messages so please be patient.

I also should've clarified I have no interest in artisans. Thank you though!

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: Sorry for the delayed response to a lot of you but there was a lot to wade through. Currently everything is still available with a couple potentials but nothing close to solid yet. Thank you for being patient.

**~~GMK Nautilus R1. Base kit, Spacebars and Novelties SOLD $200~~**. ~~Bought from Massdrop, I still have the original tray. The alphas have some shine, I’ve used the caps on and off for about a year or so. Tried to capture the shine on the pictures but its kind of hard, it is definitely noticeable but not something that ever bothered me. Feel free to ask for more pictures/videos if you are interested.~~

**Thabertooth Nemo. $30** Nautilus-colored. Has been mounted on a board but on a key that I never used.

**~~XDA Godspeed. $130~~**. ~~Bought from Massdrop. Included kits: SOLAR ALPHAS, APOLLO 40S ICONS, APOLLO ORTHO ICONS, KEYLLUMINATI,~~ ~~APOLLO TSANGAN TEXT, GODX, BLANKS~~. ~~Sold some of the kits, I have Alphas, 40S Icons, Ortho Icons and Keylluminati left. Perfect set for someone looking to fill a 40s or ortho board.~~ ~~I originally had more sets but I sold some of them to a friend, during that transaction I also sold two keycaps from the GOD X set and mixed up two keys from the Apollo Tsangan text-kit. GOD X is missing the 2.25u GODSPEED in Yellow and one 2u logo in Orange. The Apollo Tsangan kit is missing one 1.25u APOLLO and one 1.5u STOW, but comes with an extra 1.25u STOW and an extra 1.25u DEFLECT~~.

**~~Iris. White PCBs (v2 I think!), Gold plated PCB Plates, Clear acrylic tenting middle layer, 65g Zilents (R11), Silver TRSS Cable, Regular pro micros. ~~$200~~ $185. Will sell the Iris together with the XDA set for $300.~~** ~~Bought and built it July 2018 and used it as a daily driver at work for about a year. The gold plates have developed some discoloration and there are some like stains/dirt marks on them. The discoloration can be seen over the entire plates, but the marks are in between the switches and can’t be seen when keycaps are mounted on the board. Included a picture of the keyboard with keycaps on it to give you an idea of what that would look like. Feel free to ask for more pictures/videos if you are interested.~~

**Broken 75Keys ortho aluminum board $40 — OBO, no idea how to price this**. I bought this from Massdrop in July 2018 as a kit, assembled it when I got it but never used it except for testing. A colleague of mine borrowed it and used it as a daily driver for a month or so. I sold it here on mechmarket last year but when the buyer got it he reported that it didn’t work, so I refunded him and got the board back. Haven’t been able to figure out what is wrong with the PCB, I tried with different switches and outside of the case etc. but with no luck. The aluminum case is still in mint condition and should work for any 60% PCB with the right mounting holes?

**~~GMK Oblivion v2 Git Base~~** ~~- $220 shipped~~ sold

I really liked this set and picked up an extra for when my set inevitably shines, but I've since realized that I'd rather have the funds to get a variety of sets instead. The set is still sealed and comes with the fix kit and ""Hello, world"" enter key. Asking what I paid for my set aftermarket.

Lightly used for about a week before I got a mat in the original groupbuy color. Please note this is the lighter blue color, **not** the darker blue of the original groupbuy.

Hello there! Nice to meet you all! Been cleaning up lately and want to get rid of a few things that have been collecting dust.

- All prices are OBO and don't include shipping
- I will only ship insured to a Paypal verified address. Currently only shipping within the CONUS
- Would prefer to keep sets together but open to offers
- Not FCFS. Priorities will go to bundles and local offers within the SF/Bay Area
- Please feel free to ask me any questions! I may not respond immediately so please be patient

EDIT: Sorry guys getting a lot of messages. Please be patient with me!

EDIT2: Sorry but I'm going to stop responding to messages right now as I'm afraid that I might be breaking some rules here. Going to clear up with the mods as I don't want to do anything wrong.

EDIT3: Hey guys, so I was unaware of how OBO works around here when I first made the post, my apologies for this misunderstanding. I will be abiding by the rules here and higher bids will not be accepted and offers will go to those for asking, with preference to local meetups. Some people have also brought to my attention that prices for my switches were too high, so I have adjusted these as well. Please be patient while I continue to work through your messages.

This is a black top and white bottom e6.5 which is sort of rare since you would have to buy two boards (one black one white) during the GB.

Overall kb is in great condition except for a few minor blemishes which I have tried my best to take pictures of. There is a small scratch only visible in light scratch on

the nameplate and there is a minor ding on the back of the board on the white case and very very minor scuff on the back weight. Pictures in timestamp

Both nameplate and back weight comes in rose gold.

The set comes with two PCB and Plate. The back of the board has burt solder on it since it has been desoldered many times and I have cleaned it to the best of my abilities.

Built with NOS Vintage Black, 62g sprit springs lubed with krytox 105, lubed with 205g0 and filmed with white tx springs. GMK Screw in stabs lubed with 205g0. Polished brass plate & OG yellow PCB.

Second plate is brass sandblasted and also OG Yellow PCB. Has been cleanly desoldered only once.

Both plates do have minor scratching around the switch cutouts from removing switches.

Will come in original box although the box isint in the best condition since it has been thrown around in my closet alot rip. There is also only one gasket. Will come with all extra screws.

**No Keycaps included**. Outdoor pics with keycaps for picture purposes only.

Please comment before PMing.  

Item | Description | Want (Paypal, OBO)
:--|:--|:--
GMK Laser | New and sealed Cyberdeck and Mitowaves kits. | ~~$350~~ **SOLD**
Doro67 | New and unbuilt. Titanium Grey, multi-blocker layout, 2x PCB (1 regular and 1 RGB). Was pending a sale and then the person stopped responding. | ~~$370~~ **SOLD**
80x Holy Yok Pandas (Red) | Lubed with 3204. Skipped the legs to retain tactility. Used for a couple typing tests and are not for me. | ~~$100~~ **SOLD**
69x Koala Switches | New and unused. Figured if Holy Pandas aren't for me, neither are these. | ~~$45~~ **SOLD**
Switch Couture Acrylic Malice + Wrist Rest | New and unbuilt. Purchased around the time the first Malice picture appeared on Reddit. Looks like there's a scuff along the top edge of the acrylic that was most likely there since arrival as I had just unpacked this to take pictures for this sale. Can also include a new Project Keyboard PCB for $60 (purchase price). | ~~$200~~ **SOLD** 
Switch Couture Frosted Acrylic Alice | Used only for typing tests. Built using brass screws, Mill-Max 0305 sockets, and a white Project Keyboard PCB. The pictures currently show split backspace, but this will have normal backspace hotswapped when shipped. Switches and caps not included. | ~~$200~~ **SOLD**
M60-A SEQ2 | Brand new. Kuro Stealth color with hotswap PCB. | ~~$700~~ **SOLD**
Campine Mk. III | Bought from Alex himself. Case only. This does not include the original plate or PCB, but I can include them if asked though there are caveats. The bottom plate/acrylic diffuser arrived damaged at the corner and the creator was generous enough to include two brand new plates, one in clear acrylic and one in frosted acrylic. This came as a Boardwalk build and I will include all original screws, feet, and mounting hardware, but I do not know if it has everything you'll need for your own 60% build. I believe the Boardwalk uses standard mounting so it should be okay. | ~~$90~~ **SOLD**
XDA Canvas R2 Manfred | New and unused. Will include original tray. | ~~$110~~ **SOLD**
XDA Canvas R2 Bundle | All new and unused. Includes 2x Beta, 1x Micons Ortho, 1x Micons Bauhaus, 1x Micon Hobbyist. Looking to sell as a bundle and not split. | ~~$200~~ ~~$190~~ **SOLD**
Zygomorph | Built using MX Zilents lubed with 3204. Includes an extra PCB half. Does not include the keycaps shown. **NOTES:** I do not recommend this board to a beginner. I think a lot of design decisions were made to meet this board's low profile requirements. As a result, the build itself is kind of finicky and required a lot of fiddling with to make work. Also, the MX Zilents should not be harvested. In order to use standard MX switches in a Zygomorph, the metal pins have to be snipped to about half length. This renders them difficult to use in normal builds. | $150
Gemini Dusk (Barebones-ish) | Used for some typing tests. Has Box Browns mounted. This is a great kit for someone who was intending to use their own keycaps. This would probably look great with pudding caps. | $120

Hi there r/mm, getting rid of a couple things that I no longer have use for:

~~**GMK Dots:** This set's basically in like-new condition, I mounted it once on 60% board for about 15' for picture. Price: $295 with tray; $285 with bag.~~ SOLD FOR ASKING

**Drop Alt Low Profile Bare-bone:** Got this when I first stepped foot into this hobby. In very mint condition as I very quickly jumped straight into the black hole that is full custom. I did every mods possible on this board: replaced the stabs with authentic Cherry plate mount stabs from Zeal PC (https://zealpc.net/collections/switches/products/authentic-cherry-pcb-plate-mount-gold-plated-stabilizers), clipped, lubed with Krytox 205g0 and band-aid modded, added MKUltra foam (https://mkultra.click/products/massdrop-alt-low-profile-foam-combo). This board's bare-bone, it will come with the Drop box but no accessories, no keycaps, no switches. Price: $195

I'm currently looking for a couple of GMK sets so send me a msg and I'm open to trade or straight up buy it from you:


* GMK Metaverse
* GMK 9009
* GMK Darling
* GMK DMG
* Or any interesting GMK set that is not 8008

Timestamp + detailed pics ->  [https://imgur.com/a/mZQXzJ3](https://imgur.com/a/mZQXzJ3)

Listing some items for sale today that I haven't used in a while / are basically new but never got around to using them. All items are priced around what I've paid for them (probably less in some cases).

1\] Time TKL Founders edition - $750 shipped CONUS -- SOLD

\- Black with all brass accents/weights. Flawless. Built with lubed cherry clears on a hiney PCB.

\- Comes with a cleanly desoldered OG Time PCB as well.

\- The brass parts were untreated and had heavy patina on them when I acquired this board. They were subsequently sanded down with different grit sandpapers, then polished using a jewelry polish and finally clear coated to lock down the finish. This was all done by hand. The results were not flawless but still pretty damn good for me as seen in the pictures.

\- Keycaps on the board not for sale.

&#x200B;

2\] GMK Voyage (Base + Novelties) - $285 shipped CONUS (with tray) -- SOLD

\- Minimal / no use. Mostly just propped on a keyboard.

&#x200B;

3\] GMK Chocolatier (Base + Novelties) - $250 shipped CONUS (in bags - no tray available) -- SOLD

\- Minimal / no use. Mostly just propped on a keyboard.

&#x200B;

4\] Infinikey Katakana Matcha colorway - $90 shipped CONUS OBO -- SOLD

Infinikey Katakana WoB colorway - $90 shipped CONUS OBO -- SOLD

Product page ->  [https://thekey.company/products/katakana-cherry-pbt-sets?variant=20408062115929](https://thekey.company/products/katakana-cherry-pbt-sets?variant=20408062115929)

\- Both of these sets are new in box. I'm not sure on how to price these so offer away.

&#x200B;

5\] PBT keycap set - $70 shipped CONUS -- SOLD

\- These are thick PBT keycaps acquired from Korea. No use and extensive coverage (please see pictures).

&#x200B;

Please post here before sending a PM as per the rules. If you think my prices are way off, please don't hesitate to tell me that either.

**~~£95.00~~ SOLD - [Photos](https://imgur.com/a/gYqlS8o) - KBDFans (aka ""Milko-K"") NP PBT Keycaps set**
Brand new. Never mounted. Really nice crisp black and white set with latin and katakana legends. Has an excellent amount of extra keys to cover most layouts (including HHKB - my favourite). See timestamp album for photos of the same set from other people. NOTE, this set from KBDFans doesn't come with the rainbow Apple logo.

Zero signs of use. Rare set now. Reluctantly for sale. I love this set and it goes really well with my Ink purple Tokyo60 (see photos) but I've since got myself an SA Laser Cyberdeck so this is sitting here doing nothing.

**~~£220.00~~ SOLD - [Photos](https://imgur.com/a/ZaAJZAj) - Matt black top with transparent red Alice Lubrigante in Wonderland with lubed, filmed Koala T1 switches**
Lightly used off and on, no scuffs or marks. I really like the Alice layout but I keep going back to my HHKB layout so it doesn't get used as much as I'd like. Black Wonderland PCB USB-C. Built with lubed and filmed T1 Durock tactile switches (which sound and feel fantastic), clipped and lubed screw-in genuine GMK stabilizers. Also comes with 2 black anodized CNC aluminium feet to give it a great typing angle. I've also just added some new small bolts to make it look cleaner.
__No keycaps included__

**~~£65.00~~ SOLD - [Photos](https://imgur.com/a/xkb6k9Q) - White Wonderland Mini USB PCB - brand new**
I bought this before I had the opportunity to grab the Lubrigante so not needed to use it. Might be useful as a spare if you buy the Lubrigante or want to get a new acrylic Alice build cut yourself :)

Hi all, looking to offload two of my boards to make way for my work from home setup. What I have here are two board that I enjoy using. They are both fully built and will come in original packaging. Details of the boards are as follows. Key caps not included, but can potentially throw them in!

1. Mekanisk Klippe T in R1 Gray - [Typing Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ9Zr9d2dCA)

The Klippe is built with Holy Polar Pandas lubed with 3203 and spring swapped with 65g TX Springs lubed with 105 and Zeal stabilizers. The PCB is the WTD60 by Wilba and the plate is brass. The case is filled with Mekanisk Case foam and in between the PCB and plate is a piece of MK.Ultra foam. A very nice little board.

$475 shipped anywhere in the world or $400 + shipping.

~~2. Matrix Noah in Black -~~ [~~Typing Test~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klVhEmy9mxE)

~~The Noah is built with c3 Tangerines v2 lubed with 205g00 and spring swapped with 60g Slow Sprit Springs lubed with 105. The shift and enter stabilizers are from everglade and the spacebar is GMK with c3 stab stems. The PCB has RGB and plate is aluminum. The case has a bit of shelf liner in it to fill out the hollowness.~~

~~$750 shipped anywhere in the world.~~

Hi there,

I am selling a few things.

1. **2x GMK Night Runner Base Kit:** One has been opened but never used (which is when I decided to sell them as I can not see myself using it for too long as it's a bit too 'toxic' for my tastes in real life), the other one is still sealed. **Asking 220€ each plus shipping but I am willing to negotiate. Would potentially consider a trade for a more subdued keyset, must contain ISO.**
2. ~~117x Cherry MX Black: These came out of a point of sales board manufactured around the year 2000. They are well worn and thus quite smooth.~~ **~~Asking 75€ + shipping but I am willing to negotiate.~~**  **SOLD**
3. 52x Gateron Greens: Black bottom, clear top. These were soldered in my first ever board but I desoldered them shortly after. **15€ + Shipping but am willing to negotiate.**

&#x200B;

I ship using DHL and each shipment will be trackable. [Please consider DHLs general notes during Coronavirus](https://www.dhl.de/en/privatkunden/kampagnenseiten/coronavirus.html) \- shipping to some countries may not be possible at all, or only with a premium.

GMK Keyboard & Co - $100 + shipping OBO

This keyset has pretty heavy use, I've used it daily for almost 2 years. Has pretty substantial shine on the ""gaming"" keys. Tried to highlight what that looks like on the left shift, but it's difficult to take a picture of on the blue caps. All of the keycaps were washed thoroughly today before being put into the tray and they will not be used by me again.

The last chapter of **I have these but don't use them** saga is here.

Unfortunately I can't into DSA or SA, I'm stuck with Cherry profile it would seem as my favourite.

A few words on the Vortex Pok3r - it is not RGB, it is white, comes with stock OEM profile PBT material keycaps and was heavily modded - lubed and clipped stabilizers, Tribosys 3204 lubed retooled Cherry MX Blacks (very smooth), case is lined with Dynamat. It somehow justifies the price, yes I know you can get an RGB one for 90GBP, please do get that if you want to, the amount of work put into this piece justifies the price - simply lubing the switches would cost between 0.3-0.4GBP per switch at a total of around 20GBP not to mention the desolder/resolder job. The keyboard is fully assembled, please don't  assume otherwise (I had somebody tell me that because I posted pictures of the mods inside then the keyboard means it's disassembled). There's also a scuff on the spacebar, so be advised regarding that (visible in the pictures).

Have a few things to clear out as I need funds to survive in the current circumstances, so these will go a long way personally. Prices are in USD unless stated otherwise.

Local & Bundles preferred of course, and I can let it go at a much lower rate.

Cyberdeck Base Kit, opened but unused, never mounted  - ~~$300~~ ~~$285~~ $250

Mitowaves, unopened, still in its plastic wrapping - ~~$110~~ $100

Gaijin, unopened, still in its plastic wrapping - $120

~~Take all for $450 + Shipping + $20 PP Fees, else everything is OBO + Shipping + PP Fees.~~ All SOLD thanks guys.

Will prefer to ship without the trays as it cuts down the volumetric rate by a big margin (especially with Cyberdeck), but I can work out shipping with the trays too.

Shipping via EMS.

EMS Estimates (very rough estimates only for with Tray shipping, without tray, but in box will be cheaper than below):

US/UK - $25-$45, AU/NZ/CN/KR/JP - $30-$35, SG - $20

Note EMS Deliveries will be delayed as everything else is due to the pandemic. But expect delivery within 1-2 weeks from ship, at least that's the information I got from EMS here.","[MY][H] GMK Laser Cyberdeck, Mitowaves, Gaijin [W] PayPal, Local"

EDIT 1: RIP Inbox. I will try to reply to everyone as soon as I can. Cheers!

EDIT 2: RAMA's gone. GMK Dots is still available!

Hi r/mm, I have a couple of things to sell and/or trade today:

~~**RAMA M60-A Kuro:** One in, one out. In an effort to limit my personal collection to just 3 boards, I'm selling my RAMA M60-A in Kuro colorway. This board's in a very pristine condition. I personally used this board for about a week and realized HHKB layout's not my thing (and how much I miss the arrow keys). The board uses a hotswap PCB that's built with lubed and filmed Zealios V2 switches. Here's a quick price breakdown:
* RAMA M60-A Board:Kit with board, cloth, RAMA cable and the original package, no weight, no dampener, no stabs, no keycaps - Price: $595
* Extra M60-A PCB: Still in its original package - Price: $60
* 60x Zealios v2, lubed and firmed - This batch came pre-clipped from the previous seller and I lubed and firmed the switches myself with Krytox 205g0 - Price: $60
* **Bundle:** Board + Extra PCB + Zealios v2: $695
At the moment I will prioritize selling this as a bundle since I'm moving on from the Zealios v2 and would like to try different tactile switches.~~ **Sold to software architect guy**


~~**GMK Dots:** Basically like-new, mounted on my board for 15' for picture - Price: $290~~

Note that it's not FCFS, and the price doesn't include shipping. At the moment I can only ship to US address.

Now onto what I'm looking for:

* **GMK Metaverse:** I missed out on the recent R2 and would like to see if anyone's willing to part with their R1 kit.
* **GMK Sets:** Also interested in GMK DMG or any interesting GMK set to match my new board. Hit me up if you have anything you like to part with!

Stay safe everyone! Hope you all have a great day!","[US-MA] [H] RAMA M60-A Kuro, GMK Dots [W] Paypal, GMK Sets (Metaverse, DMG, any interesting sets, ...)"

Good morning /r/mechmarket 

2 items up for sale/trade today:

**GMK Miami Nights**

I picked this set early this year and it's been on my work board since and it's still one of my favorite colorways.  This is the full set that came with the original GB.  The set is older and was used heavily even before me, and thus it has a very decent amount of shine on the alphas and 7U Spacebar.  The spacebar in particular has shine all the way on the right side because the previous owner flipped the spacebar so it's got 2 shine spots.  

Personally, I don't mind shine on the set.  It is what it is and that's what ABS does, it shines up with use.  I'm not about keeping these things locked up in a closet or not using them.  That's not my thing.  So the set, while pretty, still has a lot of shine on the alphas.  The modifiers have a lot less but it still is there.  Just being completely open about this set.  

Either way it's a rarer GMK set that looks fantastic and has some decent compatibility.  (I hope they run another round of it one day with more compat)  

Looking for other GMK Sets as trade, particularly GMK Space Cadet or something that can go well with a dark grey board.  Alternatively I'm asking $225 Shipped CONUS

**Lubed and Filmed Tealio V2 x70**

~~I purchased these also at the beginning of this year, and they were in my Koyu ever since, until I sold it last week.  These are lubed with Krytox 205g0 and TX Switch Films.  These are well worn in and are super smooth.  They sound great, even when they were in the Koyu.  Never soldered, only used in hotswap, these are basically ready to be put into whatever board you're using.~~

Timestamp + pictures -> [https://imgur.com/a/rVteY2s](https://imgur.com/a/rVteY2s)

Edit 1: All RAMA keycaps + ocelot is pending. Bundled together.

Edit 2: I'm sorry for not responding to all the PMs. The first guy to PM about the bundle got more or less everything. Right now, ALL RAMA caps, ocelot and GMK Mizu bundle are sold. Only the polycarbonate KFE is available.

Edit 3: Everything is now SOLD out. Apologies to anyone that I couldn't get back to. It was because those items were already pending / sold.

1\] Polycarbonate KFE -> $1100 shipped CONUS -- SOLD for asking.

\- Built with holy zandas (zealio stem in panda housing) lubed by straight classy on a brass plate. Comes with an extra poly plate.

\- I can desolder the board but it'd take time + won't bring the cost down as the switches are basically being bundled for free.

&#x200B;

2\] GMK Mizu bundle -> $450 shipped CONUS -- SOLD for $430 in a bundle.

\- Base + Spacebars + Novelties + Both RAMA caps.

Hello! Getting rid of one of the few remaining keycap sets that I have. Looked around at prices from the past couple of days and these seem to be reflective of that. Prefer selling things as a bundle since that's less of a hassle for me. Willing to discount items if they're bought as part of a bundle.

NOTE: not interested in splitting the build but im open to offers!!

Hey guys, im selling my discipline 65 as i want to build something else, it has 62g tangerines lubed with trybosis 3204, gmk screw in stabs lubed with dielectric grease (NOTE. for some reason the backspace keycap wont fully go in into the stab), it also has a p3dstore.com 3d printed case which i sanded and painted with krylon fusion paint, and DSA quartz keycaps in great conditions, looking to get $290 for the whole keyboard (includes paypal fee but no shipping)

Also the spacebar part of the plate broke but i can provide an extra acrylic plate for you to replace it, spacebar still feels good as is (used some tape to level it out), other note is that in doesn’t has all the screws needed for the upper part of the pcb, you’ll need to get some extra standoffs as i couldn’t fin anywhere at the time i build it 

Im also interested in trades preferably an SA bliss set","[US-TX] [H] Discipline 65 with lubed tangerines [W] Paypal, maybe trades for other builds"

As title states I have a BM60 Hotswap PCB kit with brass plate and clipped+lubed stabs and XD68 65% PCB for sale.

BM60 setup was only used for a few days and then it went into storage as a different build quickly took over.

* Stabs are lubed with 205g0 and dielectric grease
* The BM60 backspace stabilizer is a Durock stabilizer, had a spare laying around and figured I'd just use it.
* Awesome setup for someone who wants to get into a 60% with dedicated arrows and hotswap capabilities without having to give into a 2U left shift (like the GK64).

As for the XD68 it has never been used and is 100% brand new.

Hey all,

Can add Paypal on my end if the value does not work out for a straight trade.

I prefer something with a Numpad (I love 1800 / compact boards), but 75% might be interesting too!

~~**\[$65CAD / $45USD\]** I just found the first project keyboard that I abandoned due to PCB issues. The keyboard is a 980Mini kit from Taobao. Cost me around $140 USD (for the acrylic case, PCB, Plate) after proxy over to Canada. It has 4 layers of acrylic in total. I am just looking to recoup the cost of gat yellows (lubed with tribosys 3204) and GMK screw-in stabs.~~ sold to u/spiftacu1ar

Here is the list of issues with this project board:

* The PCB inputs random strings of numbers.. I could not fix it after spending 3+ hours on it. For example, random numbers like ""000.1110"" will be input when ""a"" is pressed.
* I had to shave some of the gat yellow switches to fit the acrylic that was not too precisely cut.
* The stabs are overlubed. Rookie mistake. They are clipped and lubed w/ 3204 + dielectric grease.

**\[$290CAD / 205USD\] RedScarf III 96 key build**. Built with Zealios 67g and mod-m tactile switches. Page up key does **not** register 99% of the time. It probably just needs to be resoldered. Missing one screw on the bottom. Priced accordingly due to these flaws. Has RGB underglow and LED as well. Can include the stock PBT caps from [Kono Kira](https://kono.store/products/kira-mechanical-keyboard), for $80CAD/$60USD extra. (All caps from the kono kira will be included)

Shipping is extra, everything is sanitized and ready to be shipped!

Hello,

Realized I don't need arrow keys and prefer linears. Looking to sell or trade the following:

**HAVE:**

**Tofu 65% -** (silver) with brass plate, KBD67 Rev2 PCB (USB-C) and Tribosys 3204 lubed 62g Zilents with modified cherry stabs (dielectric grease + band-aid) and sound-dampening lining (thick rubber mouse mat). 78g zilent for spacebar, 67g for enter and 65g backspace. *To be clear, in the pictures: the silver case which currently holds the GMK WoB keycaps with the unmounted plate/pcb below.* I believe the plate is ANSI compatible if you would like to desolder. No dings, no scratches or anything and very good lube job if I dare say so myself. **€300**

I also have a [cable](https://i.imgur.com/4mbF6MD.jpg) made from cream paracord and transparent techflex. Yellow shrink is a little discolored but will provide a piece of yellow shrink wrap for buyer that will cover both ends. Matches the Godspeed caps very well. **€20**

**WANT:**

**60% keyboard with iso-compatible plate/pcb -** built or kit, open for suggestions, parts, more expensive kits, etc.

**Keycaps with NorDe/International kits -** for a budget build.

Shipping is approx. €20 worldwide. Please provide address for a final quote.

Hi guys! I recently built a Fox Lab Key65 for a client and am now looking to own one myself. I am looking for an unbuilt kit, if possible. I do not have a color preference, I do like black though.

***Ideally, I would like to trade my case for an unbuilt kit. If not, I would like to buy an unbuilt or built kit outright.***

***I’d like to offer $600 for a Key65.***

To trade, I have my trusty Mekanisk Fjell R4 in R1 Gray, and anbuild NK_Creams lubed with 205g0, springs lubed with 105, durock stabs lubed with superlube, brass plate, and DZ-60 PCB. GMK WoB not included, but I am flexible depending on what you are offering to trade. I would let the Fjell go for $400, and the Creams build for $200. I'm not really looking to sell, though.


If you aren't interested in trading your Key65 for my Fjell, I can also hear offers to purchase one outright. Similarly, I will also hear offers for my Fjell if there is interest, but I'm really looking for a Key65 more than anything else.

Please see the above timestamps for pictures of my Fjell, the brass weight has been polished to a mirror-like finish and has begun to patina.

~~Lastly, I have a slightly tarnished Zambumon Hexagon Dark Mousepad from NK that I damaged while building a Key65 today. Never again. I know these are available on NK right now, but if someone is looking for one at a slight discount. Asking $15 + Shipping to CONUS only~~ Removed from sale at this time.

~~Hey I got this monstargear polycarbonate XO for sale. I've used it since its initial release, but I got other hotswap boards on the way. Refer to the timestamp album for the condition of the case and the PVD brass parts. There a small imperfection on the brass weight on the back; there's a bunch of imperfections on the plate as well on around the mounting points and the back, as well as some marks made by my switch puller around the switch holes. All hotswap sockets work fine, though either the one under the home or end key has the odd problem where you'd need to bend one of the switch pins upward to work properly. Currently have the hybrid stabilizers installed, though I can clip and lube the normal included ones upon request. Includes the original box and accessories. **Looking for $500 shipped**~~ **SOLD shipped for SoCal for $485**

Hello all! I have more caps than boards (don't we all!) so I'm trying to slim down. This has been mounted on my backup board so only light use with no shine. There is some discolouration on the 1u Ctrl cap (see photos) - not sure how, you may be able to scrape it off but I haven't tried.

Will ship with trays and happy to post worldwide so long as you're happy to send currency in GBP. Not FCFS but it's almost 12am GMT so I may not reply for another 8hrs. Comment before PM (no chat please). ~~Ideally like to bundle but if I get buyers for all will consider splitting.~~

~~Asking for GBP 220 + shipping. This roughly equates to €245 or $270.~~

From experience, insured shipping is around £10 to UK, €15 to Europe, and $25 to USA.

Thanks and stay safe!

Hi guys, here is one of my endgame builds I'm selling to fund my potential future GB.

It's a Zeal Xeno in Black. Rose Gold full plate built with Holy Zeal V2 switches. Zeal stabs that came with the board are lubed and tuned to perfection. Perfect ano matching, minimal machining marks on the brass plate. Pretty much as good as it gets in terms of QC for the Xeno. It's defo A-stock material. I'll ship it in the original box it came in. 

Holy Zeal V2 are Halo stems in Zealio V2 housings. They are rounder feeling than any MX style tactile out there with the tactile bump lasting the entire travel. I personally think these are the closest you're gonna get to Alps Brown or Topre in a MX package with heavier springs. These in particular have 67g Zealio V2 springs in them so they are relatively light. They are more tactile than Holy Panda and sound similar too. They are filmed so they have no rattle. 

I'm including a set of GMK Olivia. I've been using that set ever since I received the Xeno. It's the base set + extras + Rama x Olivia ""O"" artisan. I'M NOT SPLITTING THIS SET SEPARATELY FOR SALE. This set is one with this board, and I'm selling it as a bundle. The rest of the set will come in a tray, while the ones on the board will arrive mounted. Of course I will remove all keycaps and give it a thorough clean before shipping it out.  

~~I'm looking for $1300 shipped CONUS only. I'll eat paypal fees and shipping.~~ **SOLD**

##Thanks everyone for the interest, kind compliments and responses. Everything is now sold and some weight has definitely been taken off my shoulders. Really appreciate it all.

Hopefully the initial timestamp with my name/date is ok, took it 3 times to be safe. Apologies for the poor photos.

Due to COVID, I'm going through a little bit of a personal emergency at the moment so I need some funds. If anyone is wondering why I have all these unbuilt/unused is just because I bought them waiting to be used together, Jamon going with the Key65 and the Polaris to be paired with something else at work perhaps, but anything can happen at any point in time so I'm unfortunately going to give these up. If anyone buys both the Key65 and the GMK Jamon set, I'd love to see photos of it once done.

These prices listed below **do not include shipping**, I'll work that out depending on the buyer.

**Not FCFS**, priority will go to any UK buyers however since that makes shipping significantly easier. Also would prefer Monzo/Bank Transfer over PayPal. Customs have been quite hefty at times hence the higher prices. Sorry. Feel free to negotiate with me/yell at me if I'm really delusional about pricing but I guess when things get tough, I'm just trying to scrounge for what I can. These are just based on the few recent trades I've seen for these boards.

&nbsp;

| Item  | Detail   | Condition     | Price (USD)    |
|:-----------|:------------|:-----------|:------------|
| Polaris        | E-White, Brass weight, Brass plate & PC Plate, 1x PCB. The only thing which makes this not entirely brand new is that it comes with 2.0mm and 1.5mm hex keys which I used to open up and fix my current board. I only used the 1.5mm one but it has left some [scratches on the hex key itself](https://imgur.com/ZsYMOUP). I'd appreciate it if whoever buys this lets me keep the 1.5mm one though since I don't have one this small at the moment but regardless, this is something to mention.      |Brand New*, Unbuilt       |   560     |

I got one of the PCBs still with a [reset switch](https://imgur.com/hVReN80) which will cause issues. Please check on [geekhack](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=102609.0) for more information but you just need to cut it off or desolder it basically.         |  Brand New, Unbuilt       |    630     |  
| GMK Jamon + Novelties | Not splitting the two. I got this from someone off mechmarket who said it was completely new/unused/unmounted. Seeing his pictures and inspecting it myself, I personally trust them and think there's no shine or any sign of use as well. The box/sleeve has some slight damage on it but this is fairly minor. Please check the images in the timestamp, I tried my best to show off the condition of the caps.    | Brand New, Unused/Unmounted     |240    |

Hi, I'm looking to sell the following items:

1. Red Freyr (QMK compatible) built with lubed retooled Cherry blacks, GMK screw-in stabitlizers and pink LEDs (except for Z and X - which have box whites installed and no LEDs due to incompatibility). Marks and anodization defects are shown in the album. Aside from these flaws, this board looks, feels and sounds amazing. Selling because I'm into boards with higher inclination angle - these are too flat (\~5 degree?). I'm also looking to bundle this board with the XDA Canvas TKL set (with some extra modifier keys) shown in the timestamp. - SOLD FOR $460
2. Maxkey WoB with keys shown in timestamp. Missing one 1.5u Ctrl key and 7 key on the Numpad. These have acquired quite a bit of shine especially on the Alphas - you will also probably need to clean these a bit. - SOLD FOR $50

All prices are firm. I'm also looking to trade the Red Freyr + XDA Canvas bundle for the following:

1. TX84 SE or TX60/65
2. E6V2 or E6.5
3. Any interesting high-end 60/65/75/TKL. Willing to add Paypal on my end.

*~~Switch Couture Frosted Acrylic Alice Case~~*

*~~This is the Alice case variant with the thick integrated plate.~~*

*~~I've only used this case with the mini-USB Project Keyboard PCB by maartenwuut. Not sure if it's compatible with the Wonderland PCB or any other variants.~~*

*~~The case is in acceptable condition. Some stuff has gotten in between the acrylic layers and a couple of standoffs have cracks (examples:~~* [*~~pic1~~*](https://i.imgur.com/WKdrwD2.jpg)*~~,~~* [*~~pic2~~*](https://i.imgur.com/KGvWbWJ.jpg)*~~,~~* [*~~pic3~~*](https://i.imgur.com/8jNCPs8.jpg)*~~), and the divider for the leftmost keys have broken off (~~*[*~~pic~~*](https://i.imgur.com/WWBBz1k.jpg)*~~).

*~~Note that the BOX Blacks are pre-retooling. I did not have issues with them since I only used PBT caps. Be careful if you plan on using GMK caps or ABS ones in general. Or since this Ergodox is hot-swappable, just change to whatever switches you want.  :)~~*

Tkc1800: TCK1800 Silver w/ Green Plate From the R3 GB. Built with milky top Tangies lubed with 205 G00. Clipped, lubed genuine stabs. Build is great, dream to type on, i thought this would be the one but I love my tactiles and these Switches just aren't for me. Case is flawless. Comes with gmk the depths base set and a custom cable I ordered from mechcables. $550 shipped as a bundle or keyboard by itself $330 shipped.  $380 with cable. 

~~Ducky shine 7: gunmetal year of the dog mx silvers. Great keyboard and everything works perfect. Comes with USB cable and accent keys. The silvers are too sensitive for me. $140 shipped~~

~~Ducky pudding key caps: mounted a few but didn't use them. Decided pudding caps are a bit too much for me. $25 shipped in bag.~~

Looking to sell a built TKL Monstargear Alu v2 in black today, and GMK striker base kit.

The keyboard is built with lubed h1's spring swapped and is in good condition with micro scratches that show under specific lighting. GMK striker base kit has been lightly used. Bundle gets priority.

Please note that the striker kit has been sold before but sent back to me because they keys were falling off, however, they work just fine on my current keyboard so I'm not exactly sure what the problem is but wanted you guys to keep that in mind.

Space cadet has been mounted a few times, hardly used, no shine. Comes with original gmk tray and sleeve, and custom themed blue/grey aviator cable with usb mini B end (see timestamp).

Epbt japanese used for about a month. Look good as new.

Switches never been used except the gateron yellows. They were used in a hotswap so no solder on them, pins may be a bit out of shape naturally but nothing to worry about.

Hey Mechmarket,

&#x200B;

Up for trades today is an endgame keyboard. 

&#x200B;

This is a HHKB pro 2. It is modded with novatouch sliders on the alpha keys and one on the backspace. I have lubed the sliders with 3204 and swapped out the stock controller for a Hasu BT (doesn't come with battery). 

&#x200B;

The caps are GMK Violet Tendencies, used on and off since the original GB. The modifier keys are from the recent (and last?) MitchCaps sale, custom-made to match the keyset. These are truly one of a kind. Finally, the artisan on the backspace is a No-face TXD Care Bear. Always a popular colourway, I saw this and was intent on buying it aftermarket to fit this keyboard, and I think it does perfectly :). 

&#x200B;

Comes with all other parts, e.g. original HHKB keycaps, rest of GMK base kit, also extra domes from the Novatouch.

&#x200B;

I'm looking for trades for relatively high-end keyboards. I'm open to anything really, so shoot me an offer. If shipping is an issue I have US proxies. 

&#x200B;

Lastly- If you must buy it- $800. I don't want to sell. 

&#x200B;

Thanks for looking.","[EU-UK][H]Endgame HHKB with GMK Violet Tendencies [W]Trades, Paypal"

I have 3 boards to trade:

Gothic70 | Built with T1s and C3 stabs. Caps not included. It's USB-C if you're curious.
Switch Couture Acrylic Alice | Built with Zealios 67g and the old gmk stabs. Using the ProjectKB PCB. Caps not included.
PLA75 | Unbuilt, I have already cut the gasket lining and put them in. Other than that, untouched.

I'm looking for board trades only, PC and alu boards are sick and would love em. I also love 40's and Alice layouts. Not really looking for anything acrylic *or HHKB, it's the only layout I have trouble using :(

[Album of pictures.](https://imgur.com/a/InPTOak)

Hi everyone,

I'm selling this Tofu that I bought a few months ago to mess around with. I just think that tray mounting is not for me.

The main modification done to the case is that I dremelled out the middle standoffs. I'm not experienced in dremel usage, so the spots are ugly but don't affect functionality. The thing is: I didn't just dremel out the middle two (like is often done), [I also dremelled out the 2 standoffs closer to the edge](https://i.imgur.com/J5t0ROX.jpg), so 4 total standoffs removed. This leaves only the two stand offs on the edges of the case. I did this to see just how soft I could get the bottom out feel. It turned out to be kind of a bad idea because it caused the plate+pcb to rock back and forth along the single axis between the two edge standoffs. So what I did to fix it [is add two standoffs](https://i.imgur.com/7dt2qUu.jpg) to [the mounting screws that are the exact same size as the stock standoffs](https://i.imgur.com/qy5YdXz.jpg). I added these replacement standoffs to two of the previous mounting points closer to the edge of the case. The middle standoffs remain gone, but I can provide extra standoffs if you'd like to use them for the middle standoff positions as well. Anyway, the problem is solved and there is no rocking of the plate+pcb and **the typing experience feels stock** (without the middle standoffs which make the bottom out feel horrible IMO).

One more small modification I did was making the PLATE mount to the case, rather than the PCB. (Plate vs pcb tray mount). I found that with the Tofu's tray mount design, the plate does not get attached to the case in any way and is actually not even necessary because the PCB is what gets screwed into the case standoffs. I thought this was stupid so I used longer screws and some washers to make it so that [the plate screws into the standoffs](https://i.imgur.com/0BDDzFc.jpg) on the bottom of the case rather than the PCB. (What's the point of spending $100 on a 4mm PC plate if you're not going to feel it?) Anyway, this is actually a **super simple thing to revert**. You can just use the stock screws and screw the PCB into the standoffs rathe than the using the long screws and washers that will be provided. (Stock screws will be included too).

&#x200B;

Plates -

4mm brass TYL plate has never been used and has minimal signs of tarnish. I can provide pics of the one spot if needed.

4mm PC TYL plate is in good condition as well.

&#x200B;

Prices -

I'm looking for $325 for the whole bundle of Tofu Case ($100), TYL Brass plate ($90), TYL PC Plate ($65)  and 1up HSE RGB PCB ($50) + shipping and paypal fees (\~$20).

Keycaps and switches are not included, although I will throw in the pink C3 stabilizers, relevant M2 screws and standoffs, and M2 hex wrench.

I would really really really prefer to sell this as one big bundle, and will only ship to CONUS. Local would be cool though, my zip is 98102.

I'd also be willing to trade for something comparable, so if you want to, feel free to offer me whatever you think is fair. I am looking for GMK WoB so maybe we could work on a deal if you want to get rid of a set.","[US-WA] [H] Heavily Modified E-White Tofu, TYL 4mm PC Plate, TYL 4mm Brass Plate, 1up HSE RGB PCB [W] Paypal, Trades"

Good Morning /r/mechmarket 

I'm looking to trade (maybe sell) my Rama Koyu in Kuro with everything you need to have a working board as soon as you get it.  

**Rama Koyu Kuro**

~~Purchased this board a while ago and it's been my daily use board at home ever since.  It's my 3rd Rama board and as always the quality is amazing and with my setup I think it sounds pretty good.~~  

~~The board is in perfect condition except for 1 small flaw which I've highlighted in the photos.  There is what I would call a ""Micro Dent"" underneath the spacebar.  It's REALLY hard to see in non-direct light and even in direct light it's not easy to notice.  However if you run your finger over it, you can subtly feel it.  Outside of that, the condition of the board is flawless as it doesn't move around and has been on my desk since purchasing.  Everything works on the pcb, all sockets, LEDs, etc...  I have only swapped out switches 2 times since I purchased the board.~~  

~~It has lubed and greased GMK Screw In Stabilizers, Internal Dampener for added sound improvement.~~

**SOLD WITH DAMPENER FOR $800**

**Lubed, Filmed Tealio V2s x70**  

I've got lubed and filmed Tealio V2's lubed with Krytox 205g0 and TX films.  I will include the additional 3 Tealios that I have from my package of 70 total that were lubed and filmed.  **Asking $120 Shipped CONUS**

**GMK Miami Nights**

I picked this set up the day after I bought the Koyu.  It's also been on the board since and it's still one of my favorite colorways.  This is the full set that came with the original GB.  The set is older and was used heavily even before me, and thus it has a very decent amount of shine on the alphas and 7U Spacebar.  The spacebar in particular has shine all the way on the right side because the previous owner flipped the spacebar so it's got 2 shine spots.  

Personally, I don't mind shine on the set.  It is what it is and that's what ABS does, it shines up with use.  I'm not about keeping these things locked up in a closet or not using them.  That's not my thing.  So the set, while pretty, still has a lot of shine on the alphas.  The modifiers have a lot less but it still is there.  Just being completely open about this set.  

Either way it's a rarer GMK set that looks fantastic and has some decent compatibility.  (I hope they run another round of it one day with more compat)  **Asking $225 Shipped CONUS**

**Box and extras**

~~I still have the original box, however the corners are dented and banged up.  (Product of having a little child in the house)  However the board will still come with the box.  I also have the USB-C Cable, Authenticity sticker, microfiber cloth, and little rama tool to unscrew the board if necessary.~~

**WANTS**

I'm pretty open for anything else 65% and under.  The ONLY thing above that size that I'd consider is the Satisfaction 75 (any color honestly).  Seriously I'm open but still kind of picky.  Feel free to offer something that you consider of equal value or we can do + or - paypal on either end.  If you've got something of lesser value and you want to do a + or - with keysets, switches, etc...I'm also open to that within reason.

I am not looking for Polycarb boards or Think6.5s at this time.  Both can be very nice, but not interested in the Think6.5 and Polycarb scratches too much for my liking.

~~If you absolutely feel the need to purchase this board because you have nothing to trade, I'm asking $1,300 shipped CONUS for the bundle.  Again, priced high because I'd rather trade to be honest but if you absolutely feel the need to buy the bundle, that's the price.~~ 

**Keycaps and Switches now available for sale.**

As always, please comment before PM and DO NOT send me a Reddit chat message.  I'm mostly on mobile so I will never see it.  

Thanks for taking the time to look through all of this.

Have a great rest of your day!

Hello,

Realized I don't need arrow keys and prefer linears. Looking to sell or trade the following:

**HAVE:**

**Tofu 65% -** (silver) with brass plate, KBD67 Rev2 PCB (USB-C) and Tribosys 3204 lubed 62g Zilents with modified cherry stabs (dielectric grease + band-aid) and sound-dampening lining (thick rubber mouse mat). 78g zilent for spacebar, 67g for enter and 65g backspace. *To be clear, in the pictures: the silver case which currently holds the GMK WoB keycaps with the unmounted plate/pcb below.* I believe the plate is ANSI compatible if you would like to desolder. No dings, no scratches or anything and very good lube job if I dare say so myself.  **€300**

I also have a [cable](https://i.imgur.com/4mbF6MD.jpg) made from cream paracord and transparent techflex. Yellow shrink is a little discolored but will provide a piece of yellow shrink wrap for buyer that will cover both ends. Matches the Godspeed caps very well. **€20**

**WANT:**

**60% board with iso-compatible plate/pcb -** built or kit, preferably black with a brass plate. Would make a direct swap between my Tofu 65 and a comparable Tofu 60.

**Keycaps with NorDe/International kits -** for a budget build.

Shipping is approx. €15 worldwide. Please provide address for a final quote.

Clearing out the closet.

A few things to note:

* CONUS preferred.
* Everything is new unless stated otherwise.
* Prices don’t include shipping unless stated otherwise.
* Pm first
* Not necessarily fcfs
* Bundles get priority
* Might take a few days to ship due to the current situation.
* Might be open to trades, doesn’t hurt to ask.
* Prefer to ship in bags. I know that sucks, but it's a lot cheaper and I don't have big boxes that fit GMK sets.  If you really want your GMK Box, we can work something out.
* Modern Dolch R2 will start gb soon, so be aware.  I didn't buy any of these sets during their respective group buys, so I can't pass any of the gb savings onto you.
* **No chat requests, please!**

PS: A few words to justify the value for Pearl40. Among all the stuff I listed, pearl is the one I love the most. You would probably think, it's just a 40%. But no, it's not just another 40%. The PCB support both MX and APLS. The anodization is pretty good. Man it's hefty. And there was only one round of this beauty. Oh, I forgot it does under glow. The best under glow I've seen on any keyboards.

Good afternoon! I have today a Duck Viper v2 as well as a mint condition set of GMK Sky MoDo. Turns out, I'm not a big HHKB fan, so I'm hoping that somebody else enjoys my Duck Viper v2 more than I can. The GMK set is in mint condition and was only taken out to mount and do a few quick typing tests on. It was not used extensively.

As always, please comment here before sending me a PM. All prices include shipping and all relevant fees. I can ship as early as tomorrow. I ship all packages with USPS Priority Mail. I'm open to all offers, so feel free to throw me one if prices seem unreasonable. I'm more than happy to make a deal. CONUS only!

Since my last post I've sold and traded a good amount of items to maintain my finances but I still have more I need to get rid of. Looking for some sales and trades. 

All prices do not include shipping. 

Nothing is FCFS

Due to COVID-19 pandemic please be patient with invoicing and shipping, I have many confirmed trades here and have been here for a while. I will try to get things wrapped up as quickly as I can but I'll need to recall how to reprogram some of these where I adjusted the base layout, quote shipping prices for the bundles and I'm overkill with packaging to ensure things arrive safely. 

If my prices are too high which they might be forgive me, then make me an offer, worse I will say is no. 

Few obscure wanted items listed at the end of post.

Teensy USB Modded with attached paracord cable. This was a fun project but it's a board that doesn't get used, comes with original Cherry doubleshot ABS Caps in fairly good condition with a few marks on some keys. Keycaps are in great condition. Keyboard functions 100% as intended LED's included. I never bothered to program it other than the default layout. [Typing video can be found here.](https://youtu.be/510cQYZZdiY)~~

* TG3 KBA-D2911C-KIT-RC - $150 - Comes with a teensy to USB Mod it information available online I can send the links. This was an obscure 1800 style keyboard made specifically for use with a SIEMENS Dimension RxL Max Chemistry Analyzer. It can be modded for USB use with the Teensy I just never got around to it. Uses MX Blacks that aren't particularly smooth but it's biggest feature is the keycaps, which are dyesub PBT. I cannot 100% confirm but I believe these are DCS profile and possibly made by SP specifically for TG3 to make these boards. Spacebar has weird spacing and I did end up getting some 7U PBT Spacebars from Signature Plastics so I could use this set on other boards buit colors don't match 100% but close enough.

* ~~Leopold FC980C w/ Hasu Controller - $250 - stock 45g, has been lubed previously but I haven't opened it up other than to install the Hasu programmable PCB. Could probably benefit from a cleaning and dome alignment. Caps are in good condition some are slightly tilted but it's how it came in the box. Asuka sticker on the bottom can remove if you're not interested, comes complete in box with cable and dust cover.~~

Hey mechmarket,

Have all the kits for the 8008, sealed and unopened. Bought it intending to put on my T6.5, but I think I’m leaning more towards mounting the Mizu set on it -- Can’t fully decide. Very strong preference on new /unused, but will consider gently used sets too. Also I was able to snag an extra mizu deskmat from dixie today, but wasn't able to grab an 8008 in time.

&#x200B;

Not FCFS, definitely leaning towards trading, but will consider cash offers, and hence have priced it up. This is not necessarily what I believe is a fair price, but it reflects my desire to trade first. Also note, I am waiting for Bento R2 upcoming, so I’m more likely to trade for Mizu.

CONUS Only

Don’t really have a board to throw these on at the moment so I’m looking to get something that matches the boards I have currently. WASD have some shine from the previous owner, the gamer rub was not from me. Sets below are what I’m looking for but always open to others, obviously not for sure if I’ll make the trade if it’s not on my list.

I’d trade and bring cash for a TMO as well....I don’t expect anything on that.

hey all,

This is my first time posting to [r/mmk](https://www.reddit.com/r/mmk/) and let's see how this goes.

(PRICE DROP) SOLD

\*I changed the price because it was too high\*

I am selling my wkl kbd8xmkii with a green top and black bottom because I want to look for some smaller boards. I purchased this as a B stock and was amazed when I got it. There seems to be no real damages or blemishes that can be seen beside one spec on the plate(Look at the timestamp, I can also send more pictures of the board if wanted). I have been using this every day for the past 2 months and the switches have broken in really well.

Specs:

\- gmk screw-in stabs (lubed with krytox 205g0)

\- brass plate

\- Novelkeys creams (lubed with krytox 205g0)

\-Homemade dampening (look below)

The special dampening that I have done on this board is a little something I thought of that really works. I just used some random 2mm foam for between the PCB and case to get rid of any hollow sound. Then, (this is where my special technique comes in) I used some hockey tape that I twisted into a long string and put this along with the top case where it comes into contact with the plate. This removes the metal on metal and made the sound a lot better. Especially when paired with the creams this board sounds and feels amazing (And if you can remove it if you don't want it). Message me if u want any more photos.

Wants:

\- Fjell gray(maybe black)

\- Polaris (PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, I have wanted this board for a while now and I am craving to build or get one, I am open to most colors)

\- space65

\- almost any board, just want to see what people want to trade and if there is anything that might peak my interest

**Fjell**

Looking to sell my purple Fjell from round 4:

* Built with Drop holy pandas, lightly lubed with 3204 on the stem sliders, spring, and bottom housing. Legs are unlubed.
* GMK screw in stabilizers, clipped, lubed and band aid modded.
* ISO layout with 6.25u space.
* DZ60 PCB, Mekanisk brass plate.
* Layer of foam in the case.
* Caps not included.

Selling this because I prefer linears. One of the screws broke off in the case when I was assembling it, but fortunately it's a central screw that doesn't affect the mounting. Apart from this, it's in perfect condition. Looking for **£390 GBP + shipping.** This is less than I paid for all parts. Also open to trade offers.

**Artisans**

Bottom 2 rows are for sale, the rest trade only. If the price isn't listed below, it's not for sale.

Shipped Prices are for CONUS

Everything here is OBO

Got a few things to sell today.

&#x200B;

**~~FC660C - $90 Shipped~~** ~~- Read this one carefully please. The board works fine but, as you may be able to tell the keycap set I got for it doesn't exactly fully work, so you will probably need keycaps. Itll come without any because I am gonna return the ones I got. Also there is a crack from the previous owner by the escape key, this causes escape to feel kinda mushy. Other than that it works great~~ Sold

&#x200B;

**~~Octagon v3 - $650 Shipped~~** ~~This thing is pretty much fully loaded. Comes with a fat internal steel weight, a wood insert, plate foam and 2 builds. Meaning you have 2 pcbs and 2 plates to work with. they are both alu plates and one is a little bent but the other is good. The primary build uses retooled blacks that were cherrypicked from 300 switches. They are decently smooth but still retooled blacks. Also has Durock stabs. 2nd build are mx browns with c3 stabs, this is the build with the bent plate.  Keycaps Not included.~~ Sold Pending Payment

1. **KBD8MKII. Tsangan layout.  Poly top and e-white bottom** with **lubed mx zilents.**  Wanted to use for work but corona happened.

~~2. **KBDFans Pebble Tsangan hotswap .  Read carefully.**  I bought this recently here but the PCB is quarky so **selling as is**.  The sockets seem to be a bit stretched so you need to bend one of the pins to make contact with the khalil socket.  all sockets work besides the right control. I think you can use wires to bridge the ctrl. The Case/plate is a top mount and is comparability with majority of 60% pcbs.   **$200 shipped OBO**.~~

Note that **shipping may take longer than a week** due to the covid-19 situation. I have had packages ship to Guam using USPS Priority Mail that have take as little as a week or as long as a month to get to me.

Note too that I will get these shipped out by the end of the week as I have personal matters mid-week to attend to.

Good Morning /r/mechmarket 

I'm looking to trade (maybe sell) my Rama Koyu in Kuro with everything you need to have a working board as soon as you get it.  

**Rama Koyu Kuro**

Purchased this board a while ago and it's been my daily use board at home ever since.  It's my 3rd Rama board and as always the quality is amazing and with my setup I think it sounds pretty good.  

The board is in perfect condition except for 1 small flaw which I've highlighted in the photos.  There is what I would call a ""Micro Dent"" underneath the spacebar.  It's REALLY hard to see in non-direct light and even in direct light it's not easy to notice.  However if you run your finger over it, you can subtly feel it.  Outside of that, the condition of the board is flawless as it doesn't move around and has been on my desk since purchasing.  Everything works on the pcb, all sockets, LEDs, etc...  I have only swapped out switches 2 times since I purchased the board.  

It has lubed and greased GMK Screw In Stabilizers, Internal Dampener for added sound improvement.  I've got lubed and filmed Tealio V2's in here lubed with Krytox 205g0 and TX films.  I will include the additional 3 Tealios that I have from my package of 70 total that were lubed and filmed.  

**GMK Miami Nights**

I picked this set up the day after I bought the Koyu.  It's also been on the board since and it's still one of my favorite colorways.  This is the full set that came with the original GB.  The set is older and was used heavily even before me, and thus it has a very decent amount of shine on the alphas and 7U Spacebar.  The spacebar in particular has shine all the way on the right side because the previous owner flipped the spacebar so it's got 2 shine spots.  

Personally, I don't mind shine on the set.  It is what it is and that's what ABS does, it shines up with use.  I'm not about keeping these things locked up in a closet or not using them.  That's not my thing.  So the set, while pretty, still has a lot of shine on the alphas.  The modifiers have a lot less but it still is there.  Just being completely open about this set.  

Either way it's a rarer GMK set that looks fantastic and has some decent compatibility.  (I hope they run another round of it one day with more compat)

**Box and extras**

I still have the original box, however the corners are dented and banged up.  (Product of having a little child in the house)  However the board will still come with the box.  I also have the USB-C Cable, Authenticity sticker, microfiber cloth, and little rama tool to unscrew the board if necessary.

I AM NOT LOOKING TO SPLIT THIS BUNDLE AT THIS TIME, PLEASE DO NOT ASK!!

**WANTS**

I'm pretty open for anything else 65% and under.  The ONLY thing above that size that I'd consider is the Satisfaction 75 (any color honestly).  Seriously I'm open but still kind of picky.  Feel free to offer something that you consider of equal value or we can do + or - paypal on either end.  

**If you absolutely feel the need to purchase this board because you have nothing to trade, I'm asking $1,300 shipped CONUS for the bundle.  Again, priced high because I'd rather trade to be honest but if you absolutely feel the need to buy the bundle, that's the price.** 

As always, please comment before PM and DO NOT send me a reddit chat message.  I'm mostly on mobile so I will never see it.  

Thanks for taking the time to look through all of this.

Have a great rest of your Sunday!

Hey y'all doing some spring cleaning of some great boards that I haven't been using recently

~~[Bluetooth HHBK with GMK Skeletor](https://imgur.com/NVYPndX) - This awesome HHBK has bluetooth capabilities. It was aftermarket spray-painted Purple and was given an [awesome backside](https://imgur.com/pm8QU1L). The switch housings have been modified to accept MX/GMK sets and lightly lubed to give it some extra awesomeness. This keyboard comes with GMK Skeletor since I think the set matches the keyboard so well. **I don't intend to sell GMK Skeletor separately at this time.** It also comes with an awesome  tie-dye purple spacebar. Price is 500 shipped which comes from 250 for the board (paid 400+ for this after all the modifications) and 250 for the GMK set. If you just want the board and not GMK Skeletor, that's also fine.~~ SOLD hilariously to the person I originally bought it from, did I just get got?

~~[White Realforce87u](https://imgur.com/ZnSHkCI) - Another absolute beauty. This 87u has an aftermarket cable installed with aviator connector. It has been modified to accept MX keysets as well as regular Topre keysets. Just like the HHKB this has been lightly lubed to increase the awesome thockness and make it even more buttery smooth. **I would strongly prefer to sell this keyboard with JTK Red on White (with Coca Cola spacebar addon) but if you want to buy it without the set then we can work something out.** Price for this is 250 shipped (225 for realforce with aftermarket mods and 25 for JTK Red on white).~~ SOLD

~~[iKBC-MF87 with 67g Zealios](https://imgur.com/9cr331Z) - An excellent solid metal mechanical keyboard that comes with fantastic 67g zealios. This is a dream to type on it and it has per-key RGB that you can program to do all sorts of cool things. The 67g zealios are lubed and were installed aftermarket. Price is 250 shipped (keep in mind this thing is 4 solid pounds of titanium so it will be expensive to ship).~~ SOLD

[Purple KBD75v1 with MX Greens](https://imgur.com/fHnpFeP) - Not entirely sure I want to sell this so we will see if anyone bites, but this keyboard has the best mx greens I've ever felt. They are a slightly ligher, more clicky/tactile holy pandas (but not nearly as loud as mx blues) if that helps anyone conceptialize them. **I'd prefer to sell the keyboard without GMK Tokyo Nights but if you super-duper want the set with it we can work something out** Price is 200 shipped (roughly add 200 if you want GMK Tokyo Nights).

~~[Black Realforce 87u](https://imgur.com/nM7LN1H) - This was my favorite keyboard for the longest time. Absolute joy to type on. I swapped the 45g topre domes with 55g topre domes and it's awesome to type on. If you would prefer the stock 45g domes I can reinstall those if you want. Keyboard and caps have a little shine, but really it's stil in great condition. Price is 175 shipped.~~ SOLD

Add $5 for shipping on the switches and cable and caps $10 for the keyboards. Looking for USA sales for simplicity of shipping and timing. Please reply before messaging. NO chats I don't get the alerts and likely wont look.


Good evening everyone! In my hunt to find the ""right"" keyboard I've gone through a few things that aren't making the cut so I'm here to release some back to the wild and see if I can get anything picked in in trade.


Ducky shine 7 year of the dog. I would keep this one if it had tactile switches but the silver cherry switches are just too light for me honestly. Really solid keyboard and there are o-rings installed on every key. Does not rattle. I'm not the first owner but a dream of a ducky. $140. \


Yc8 cable I'm a bit ashamed but I forget where I got this one and how much. $45 or let me know if I'm far off on this one.

​
ducky pudding keycaps. I bought these thinking they'd be awesome on my rgb boards but never felt right. Mounted a few of them but took them right off. $25.

Tai hao keycaps $35

Box royal X 98 came out of a Kira Kona.  $50

As for trades full or partial I'm looking for 40x zelios v2 67g, zilents x100, keycap sets (green, blue colors I need something like base gmk set for key coverage) ymdk hotswap pcb, switch film.","[US-KS][H] ducky shine 7, tai hao keycaps, box royals [W] PayPal, trades"

hey all, 

This is my first time posting to r/mmk and let's see how this goes. 

# I am selling my wkl kbd8xmkii with a green top and black bottom because I want to look for some smaller boards. I purchased this as a B stock and was amazed when I got it. There seems to be no real damages or blemishes that can be seen beside one spec on the plate(Look at the timestamp, I can also send more pictures of the board if wanted). I have been using this every day for the past 2 months and the switches have broken in really well.

Specs:

\- gmk screw-in stabs (lubed with krytox 205g0)

\- brass plate

\- Novelkeys creams (lubed with krytox 205g0)

\-Homemade dampening (look below)

The special dampening that I have done on this board is a little something I thought of that really works. I just used some random 2mm foam for between the PCB and case to get rid of any hollow sound. Then,  (this is where my special technique comes in) I used some hockey tape that I twisted into a long string and put this along with the top case where it comes into contact with the plate. This removes the metal on metal and made the sound a lot better. Especially when paired with the creams this board sounds and feels amazing (And if you can remove it if you don't want it). Message me if u want any more photos.

Wants:

\- Fjell gray(maybe black)

Selling my black Tofu HHKB case with brass back weight with an HS60v2 RGB hotswap PCB. The case has a layer of Sorbothane on the bottom (with a piece of paper over it to cover up the stickiness of the Sorbo, probably isn't necessary) which can naturally be removed upon request. The PCB has a couple of strips of Sorbo between the switches as well. These give the Tofu a nicer sound signature in my opinion. 

The PCB has GMK stabilizers installed, which are lubed with Mechlube. 

The case has some small chips on the top part from removing switches, which are hard to see on pictures and aren't visible in day to day use.

Hello, selling a very low mileage Rama Koyu Moon. Hasn't been used much at all. Only a slight annodisation mark on the bottom shown on one of the pics. Has a hot swap PCB. 

Asking 1050 USD OBO. Can supplement with trades of high end boards. I can add PayPal if needed. Also like GMK sets like Mizu, Wavez, Burgundy, Serika. Price is including shipping in Canada. 
Can ship to the US but you will likely incur tax/duties. 
SOLD 890 USD

Attempted to follow through with trades across the pond but the cost is quite inhibitive at the moment unfortunately.","[CA-BC] [H] Rama Koyu Moon [W] PayPal, Interac, Trades"

I personally didn't mount the keys, just inspected them. There is no shine, this set boasts a larger base kit than Minimal as it includes the numpad.~~|~~$225 Shipped~~|

You can mix and match the two sets of use them on two different boards. One set has a 1.75u shift and the other has a full right shift for better  compatibility. Both sets are in 9/10 condition with no shine. Only defect is that there is a scratch on the ""K"" key which can only be seen in certain lighting that I couldn't capture it on camera.

Welcome to my humble shop!


Everything has a price, but I’m prioritizing getting my hands on GMK Striker with a numpad kit.

-	GMK Penumbra w/ Solarized alphas: copped these off the market, pretty heavily used, but in fantastic shape nonetheless. $200 + shipping in bags. Or Striker + numpad —**SOLD**

-	DSA Royal Navy: Gorgeous doubleshot abs, magnificent shape aside from minimal shine on space bar and WASD. Alphas, text mods, numpad, novelties. $200 + shipping or Striker. 

I can also just PayPal for striker.

**Fjell**

Looking to sell my purple Fjell from round 4:

* Built with Drop holy pandas, lightly lubed with 3204 on the stem sliders, spring, and bottom housing. Legs are unlubed.
* GMK screw in stabilizers, clipped, lubed and band aid modded.
* ISO layout with 6.25u space.
* DZ60 PCB, Mekanisk brass plate.
* Layer of foam in the case.
* Caps not included.

Selling this because I prefer linears. One of the screws broke off in the case when I was assembling it, but fortunately it's a central screw that doesn't affect the mounting. Apart from this, it's in perfect condition. Looking for **£400 GBP + shipping.** This is less than I paid for all parts. Also open to trade offers.

No price = Trade only.

Not listed = Not avail.

All prices **include** PP fees but **exclude** shipping.

Bundles will be discounted.

Note that in lieu of the pandemic, shipping through UPS or Aramex which are insured and tracked properly are **highly recommended**. This would be around 25-30$. Your other option would be Singapore Post, much cheaper but not insured fully + limited tracking.

Bought the Dots very recently, however my build plans have changed since I purchased it and I would like to trade for different sets. Red Samurai (1800 kit) was [used in my tofu](https://imgur.com/a/HP6HMNG) for around 2 weeks then put back into the box. Dots is trade only and tentatively I would say 140 for the Red Samurai however I would highly prefer a trade.

Hey Mechmarket,

Up for trades today is an endgame keyboard. 

This is a HHKB pro 2. It is modded with novatouch sliders on the alpha keys and one on the backspace. I have lubed the sliders with 3204 and swapped out the stock controller for a Hasu BT (doesn't come with battery). 

The caps are GMK Violet Tendencies, used on and off since the original GB. The modifier keys are from the recent (and last?) MitchCaps sale, custom-made to match the keyset. These are truly one of a kind. Finally, the artisan on the backspace is a No-face TXD Care Bear. Always a popular colourway, I saw this and was intent on buying it aftermarket to fit this keyboard, and I think it does perfectly :). 

Comes with all other parts, e.g. original HHKB keycaps, rest of GMK base kit, also extra domes from the Novatouch.

I'm looking for trades for relatively high-end keyboards. I'm open to anything really, so shoot me an offer. If shipping is an issue I have US proxies. 

Lastly- I'd take a faintly ridiculous sale. $800 shipped, priced high because I really don't want to sell it. 

Thanks for looking.","[EU-UK][H]HHKB pro 2 with GMK violet tendencies[W] Trades, Paypal?"

Hello, I have a few things for sell today. 

&nbsp;

The Escape Keyboard POMs were purchased pre-group buy, and they have never been mounted. Its the Sugarcube Alphas kit with full Mods. I found that I didn't really like the look of OEM after comparing them to my GMK, also didnt end up liking the texture of POM saddly.

&nbsp;

The Romeo 40% kit was purchased during the GB. I only opened the box to check the parts, nothing has been soldered or removed from the box. I was really looking forward to building this awesome little board but I currently have to many keyboard projects coming up. 

&nbsp;

All prices contain shipping and PayPal fees.

*I will only ship with-in the USA.*

**[Heok Dolch: $730](https://imgur.com/a/dxtXmQ2)**

Ridiculously heavy board (5.2kg OR 11.46lbs). Pretty rare board as it was a korean only groupbuy. It has some minor scuffs and has machining marks around the top half of the board. Board was built(not by me!) with unlubed creams on a FR4 plate. The bottom row is a bit goofed atm but I will fix it before sending it out.


~~**[GMK Muted: $300](https://imgur.com/a/3LGSr9n)**~~

Had this set for a while but I'm not completely sure if it has shine or it just looks like that normally so you can look at the pictures and determine it yourself :p Also comes with the cyan and lilac accents. Add $10 if you want the tray as well.


**95x Linjars:$90**

Lubed with 205g0 and filmed.


~~**OG Tulia Deskmat: $60**~~

Unused deskmat from the original Mizu groupbuy.

~~Hello /r/mm!~~

~~Looking to sell this set and pay more to see what the craze about an expensive GMK set is all about. Or maybe an SA set, love how thick and thocky they sound.~~

~~For the 65%/75% part. **PLEASE RESEARCH THIS** I'm including a **blank white 1.75 unit keycap** that perfectly matches the set but you will need a 65% keyboard with standard 1.25 unit bottom row keys and the 'gap'. ***Example: Drop Alt, KBD67, Savage65***~~

~~I'm bringing this up because certain 65%/75% keyboards have some 1 unit modifier keys and 2 to 2.25 unit right shifts. This set will only work if you have 1.25 standard unit bottom row modifiers, a 6.25 unit spacebar, and a 1.75 unit right shift.~~

~~**Also, since this set was meant for a standard 80% or full-sized keyboard. The Insert, home, page-up, page-down, delete, etc will be slightly staggered on a 65%/75% layout, as with any usual keycap set not specifically designed for a 65-75% keyboard will always be.** I don't mind this, but maybe you will.~~

   * I am currently looking for trades, but if someone really wanted it: 300 + shipping (this is what I paid for it on mm earlier) CONUS Only. SOLD 
   * I am looking for trades for other hot-swap boards (hoping to trade up). I would prefer anything but tray-mount but if you have an offer be sure to PM me!
* Gateron Black Inks: 69 are lubed with Krytox 205g0, filmed with orange tx films, and spring swapped with 60g SPRiT Springs. 11 are completely stock. I can include extra films and springs if you need them. I can also include the stock springs if people need them.
   * Note: I am not an experienced lubber by any means / PM me for a sound test.
   * I am looking to trade them for Alpacas. I want them to be stock so I can lube them myself but would entertain offers for lubed Alpacas as well. If someone really wants them: 80 + shipping CONUS only. SOLD

If anyone needs more photos, sound tests, or things like that, I would be happy to provide them just shoot me a PM. (i can't promise quality however, they are going to be coming from my iPhone).

[Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/Jn5amut)

**EDIT:** Everything has sold. Thanks to everybody who contacted me!

**Description:**

**TADA68:** They board has Tiffany Blue Tealios v2 67g lubed with Tribosys 3204. The board is in excellent condition. They switches are lubed with just the right amount of lube and are buttery smooth but not mushy. I personally loved this board and used it for about half a year.

**Hotswap** Acrylic Alice: It's an Alice PCB R3 board with a custom frosted acrylic case by Switch Couture. I've solderd in original MillMax 7305 sockets so you can hotswap with any switch you like. The board was flashed with the most recent firmware but never used besides that.

**GMK Night Runner:** This is a GMK Night Runner set which recently dropped. The switches were put onto the Monstagear board for the photo but were never used. They are mint condition, no shine. It comes with original packaging.

**Acrylic Lube Station:** This is a nice 32 slot acrylic lube station also by Switch Couture. Can't tell you much more besides it's really nice if you have to lube lot's of switches.

**Monstagear Alu Xo V2:** The board is from the A-Stock group buy. It is an hotswap board and comes with everything which was included. USB-C cable, original packaging, a tube of Super Lube, a sticker and 4 rubber feets which I both haven't applied yet. The board is very heavy and has an extremely nice sound! It's programmable and has LED backlight under the keys and on the sides. It's completely unmodified and unused. I've just put in the switches and plugged it in to verify that it works.

**Halo True switches:** These are 90x Halo True switches from a recent Massdrop buy. They are unlubed and completely stock. It is a tactile switch and very popular because you can make different kind of switches with them (Paco switches etc.) They were also never used, just put into the Monstagear one time. No bent pins.

I care a lot about my keyboard, so everything is working and in a very good conditions. All boards are clean and working. Shipping is not included and depends on your country. I ship everything with tracking. Preferably I would like to ship to somebody from Germany but it's not a must.

It's taken me about two years to buy and assemble these keyboards, all 96 layouts (my favorite!). At this point I am not interested in parting out the keyboards. My prices are firm. All of my keyboards are in fantastic condition and none have any problems. There is a very slight bit of shine on a few of the keys, but otherwise these keyboards are truly beautiful.

A couple notes.

I don't recall which stabs I used, but I think most of them are the stabs that came with the keyboard kits.

I had each of the boards custom powdercoated at a local [professional shop](https://trianglepowdercoating.com/). If you're not familiar with powdercoating, it essentially makes metal indestructible, in addition to looking very cool. You would seriously have to dunk these boards in acid to mess up the finish. In other words, they look flawless and they will continue to look so for many years to come. Click the link below to see the powder I bought (which is sprayed onto the board after prep. and then baked in an oven). Some of these coats are textured, some are smooth with glossy finish. Again, click the link for the powder to read about its finish.

Hello,

Post the last of the stuff I currently have for sale. I have desided to add shipping to most of the items this time around, shipping from Norway is very expensive, all is priced at cost, and I am covering around 50% of all shipping. If you want to bundle more stuff together we can discuss a discount.

Good afternoon everyone! Need to recoup some money to fund a new mic setup and I have no need for these items any longer so I'm hoping that they can find a better home with many of y'all. As always, prices are not final and I'm more than happy to negotiate a price so that both happy are happy. Please comment here first before sending me a PM. Please do not send chats, I most likely won't see them and won't reply to them. You can also reach out to me through discord (Arstallie#4516). I ship everything thru USPS Priority Mail and all prices shown include all relevant fees such as shipping and PayPal fees. Items that are struck through are sold and I will update these at my earliest convenience. Thanks for looking!

Hi everyone I have a couple of things that I would like to sell or trade.

* eWhite Tofu60: Kbd6x Hotswap Pcb, lubed/clipped/band-aid modded cherry stabs, polycarbonate plate, and neoprene case foam. Note: there are scratches on the plate from the switch puller (very common not visible).  

   * I am currently looking for trades, but if someone really wanted it: 265 + shipping. CONUS Only.
   * I am looking for trades for other hot-swap boards (hoping to trade up). I would prefer anything but tray-mount but if you have an offer be sure to PM me!
* Dark Grey Tofu65: Dz65RGB Howswap PCB, lubed/clipped cherry stabs, brass plate, brass weight, and case foam. Note: there are scratches on the plate from the switch puller (very common not visible).  

   * This is not for sale, only looking for trades.
   * I am looking for trades for other hot-swap boards (hoping to trade up). I would prefer anything but tray-mount but if you have an offer be sure to PM me!
* Gateron Black Inks: 69 are lubed with Krytox 205g0, filmed with orange tx films, and spring swapped with 60g SPRiT Springs. 11 are completely stock. I can include extra films and springs if you need them. I can also include the stock springs if people need them.   

   * Note: This is my first time lubing. I did watch a lot of videos and follow Andy V Nguyen's tutorial to lube switches. I think they came out really nice (sound and feel great) but I wanted to be discrete. If the buyer wants I can send them a sound test of how they sound.
   * I am looking to trade them for Alpacas. I want them to be stock so I can lube them myself but would entertain offers for lubed Alpacas as well. If someone really wants them: 90 + shipping CONUS only.

If someone buys both the Tofu60 and the Switches I can sell them both for 350 + shipping. CONUS only

If anyone needs more photos, sound tests, or things like that, I would be happy to provide them just shoot me a PM. (i can't promise quality however, they are going to be coming from my iPhone).

I am also looking for gmk WoB / Hiranga / Oblivion

Lightly modified Pok3r for sale. Switches are Cherry MX Silver and I replaced the factory stabs with GMK plate mount stabs from NovelKeys. Stabs were lubed w/ 205g0 but the spacebar may need more soon. Spacebar stabs currently have a a bit of scotch tape on the pegs to keep the spacebar from the Tai Hao set from occasionally popping off on one side. Board is in excellent working condition with only one blemish on the upper right corner (pictured in timestamp). Comes with double-shot Tai Hao BoW ABS caps, the original PBT set, original packaging and cable.

Midnight Bronze Pok3r | Cerakoted here in Texas, bought from WASD with GMK Honeywell (if you are looking for Honeywell rn I suggest looking at their site they got a few sets on there that you can get with a board).

**Pink Extent** https://imgur.com/a/8qjGc7t

The board doesn't have the issues with the cracked polycarbonate that some people in the groupbuy had and the actual case is in v clean condition. There are two issues with the board, 1) the brass plate has developed a patina that's not the most attractive as you can see in pictures 2) I soldered this when I was much less taleneted at soldering/desoldering and at one point I damaged the PCB so that the K key didn't work, I have since patched the trace and so this has now been fixed and the whole board works just fine. The switches in it are the R1 67g zealios which are unlubed.

Hi fellows

Today I am selling the following items-

**A.**  **\[SOLD\]**  Acrylic Hotswap Tofu with DZ60 RGB and Brass Plate which includes-

1. DZ60 RGB ANSI V2 Hotswap PCB with arrows layout
2. Brass plate
3. KBDFans Acrylic Tofu case
4. The PCB has GMK screw-in stabilizers (lubed and clipped)

Price: $194 + shipping. (Priced as a bundle, do not intend to sell parts separately )

What else do you need to complete the build

1. Key switches of your choice, I have some switches but do not intend to sell right now. But if you badly need it, we can discuss it.
2. Keycaps of your choice, You can buy the following keycap sets I am offering, then you will get both keycaps and USB-C cable and I will give you $5 discount on total price on top of that.
3. USB-C cable to connect the keyboard to your device, if you buy the keycap set listed below you do not need this.

Comment: This is arguably one of the best keyboards to get into the beautiful hobby of the custom keyboard. You will get a hot-swap PCB so that you can try out different switches and find the favorite one. It is also aesthetically pleasant looking build in my opinion and the sound with the brass plate is really nice. The tofu case is almost brand new, I bought it from KBDFans with DHL shipping fee and used only once. I love this little keyboard but I m not using it and I found my favorite switch, so that is why I want to sell it.

&#x200B;

**B.**  **\[SOLD\]** XDA Canvas Keycap Set - 119 keys with **Free** matching Mechcables USBC to USBC 7ft jumbo Canvas cable with 8inch coil

Price: $85 + shipping

Comment: It is a beautiful keycap set, unfortunately, I do not use it anymore, so selling it with the coiled cable as a freebie which I do not need either.

&#x200B;

**Notes**:

1. Please give me at least 2 days of time so that I can go to the post office to post it. I am trying to ship multiple items at the same time.
2. CONUS only 
3. Please comment before messaging

* Brass plate, built with NK Creams lubed with GPL 204g00 and pre-retool GMK screw in stabs
* Comes with original gold knob from the GB as well as a matte silver knob from splitkb (this one sits down fully on the encoder to allow the encoder's button to press)

No price = Trade only.

Not listed = Not avail.

All prices **include** PP fees but **exclude** shipping.

Bundles will be discounted.

Note that in lieu of the pandemic, shipping through UPS or Aramex which are insured and tracked properly are **highly recommended**. This would be around 25-30$. Your other option would be Singapore Post, much cheaper but not insured fully + limited tracking.

Got a white one in the last round of sales, ended up buying a black one from another seller. Unbuilt and unopened but I will open and inspect once paid for. I'll issue a full refund if anything is visibly amiss and handle returns/refunds with the fine folks at cftkb. $95 plus shipping. CONUS only for now. Includes the dampening foam. 

Is this more than retail? Yes, but it's also what I paid for the one that's replacing it and these are selling for ridiculous amounts built. Hopefully someone will enjoy actually building this one. 

SOLD! Thanks everyone.

~~WASD v3 TKL w/ 67g Zealios - $150 Shipped. Second owner. Previous owner used this very little. I've used it for a couple of months.

~~GMK Honeywell - $140 Shipped in bag. Pretty sure this set is R1. I am the second owner. Minimal to no shine, and the color is still in pretty great shape overall. BEWARE: Previous owner used these with box switches so the stems are not snug, but they are not damaged or cracked. In my honest opinion, it's only really noticeable on the longer keys, like the spacebar, and it wasn't really that big of an issue for me.~~ Sold

Hello,

Post the last of the stuff I currently have for sale. I have desided to add shipping to most of the items this time around, shipping from Norway is very expensive, all is priced at cost, and I am covering around 50% of all shipping. If you want to bundle more stuff together we can discuss a discount.

Please keep the thread drama free.

Condition: Board is in perfect condition other than 5-6 small machine marks on the front bottom half of board. I've included a picture from up close and further away  
Price: $160  SOLD~~
  
~~Brutal60 w/ instant60 PCB tsangan layout R2- Black, GMK stabs lubed with Krytox 205G0, tealios lubed with tribosys 3204, foam under PCB from improved sound resonance

It is a hotswap board so perhaps one of the contacts are loose, not too sure, never did break out the soldering iron to see. Other than that the PCB works perfectly.

Hello, this is my first post here so please let me know if I've made any mistakes or I'm inadvertently breaking any rules!

I have a brand new GMK WoB Hiragana base keyset for sale.  I snapped it up when I saw it appear on NovelKeys after the GBs got shipped, only to realise afterward that it won't be suitable for use on my JIS-layout keyboard because the ろ key is on Row 1 rather than Row 4.

[Timestamp/Pic](https://imgur.com/a/TcbVbgB)

I have opened it, very briefly, to see if there was an arrangement that I could make work, but I quickly realised there wasn't and sealed it back up again.

This is a great set if you're looking for a clean hiragana aesthetic on an ANSI/ISO board (both seem to be supported with just the base set).

**I'm looking for $150**, which is what I paid NovelKeys for the set, but I'll cover shipping to make up for my lack of foresight ;-) (within the US at least; international shipping will cost extra). Reasonable offers will also be considered.

Thanks for your time, and let me know if you have any questions!

I will also include the original cherry browns that come with it. It has one very minor scratch on the inside next to the stab, see pictures below. [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/jXzzwzC)

~~Epbt Black Japanese - $65 shipped~~ SOLD

 * This is from the very first round, so it does not come with 65/75% support. The last pic in the timestamp will show you exactly what keys you'll receive. 
 * I believe the previous owner that I bought these from had some keys (I think just the 60% keys) mounted on pre-retooled box switches. They still work just fine, but some are slightly looser than others.
 * Good condition overall, no shine that I noticed. 

~~Epbt Blue Cyrillic - $55 shipped~~ SOLD

 * Previous owner sold this to me w/o a 1.75U shift. They also included a 7u GMK blue spacebar that matches fairly well
 * Still in great shape, no shine.

**NPKC PBT Green & Blue Accent caps - $20 shipped**

 * Bought these years ago, might have used each set once or twice.
 * Both sets come with 6.25u spacebar, enter, esc, arrow keys, & WASD

~~SKCM Brown Alps x 116 - $3/switch + shipping or $315 shipped for all~~ SOLD

 * Extremely good condition, no need to clean these. Easily a 9.5/10

~~SKCM Orange Alps - $110 shipped~~ SOLD

 * 102 Oranges + 1 lock switch
 * Good, but varying condition. I'd range them from 8-9/10
 * Tops & stems were ultrasonically cleaned
 * Stems lubed with PTFE Spray, Springs lubed with GPL-106
 * I paper modded maybe 10 of these as those sounded a tiny bit clicky

**SKCM Cream Damped - $25 shipped**

 * 79 Bamboo/22 Pine Creams (101 total)
 * Good overall condition, probably a 7.5/10
 * Tops & stems were ultrasonically cleaned
 * Stems lubed with PTFE Spray, Springs lubed with GPL-106

~~AEK M0115 Keycaps - $40 shipped~~ SOLD

 * Great condition, slight yellowing on spacebar.
 * Caps have been ultrasonically cleaned.
 * Comes with full set of stabilizers

**AEK II 3501 Keycaps - $35 shipped**

 * Same condition as the m0115 set, but this spacebar is a bit more yellowed.
 * Caps have been ultrasonically cleaned. 
 * Comes with full set of stabilizers

~~IBM 5140 Keycaps Set 01 - $30 shipped~~ SOLD

 * Great condition, next to no yellowing on spacebar.
 * Caps have been ultrasonically cleaned. 
 * Comes with full set of stabilizers

~~IBM 5140 Keycaps Set 02 - $25 shipped~~ SOLD

 * Same condition as set 01, but the spacebar is noticeably yellowed.
 * Caps have been ultrasonically cleaned. 
 * Comes with full set of stabilizers
