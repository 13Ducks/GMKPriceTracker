Hi All!

Selling a few things to fund some recent photography purchases. All items below are priced in USD, not including shipping - since I have no idea what it will cost to ship some of these. Everything comes with original packaging (except the GMK extra key organizers) except the Tokyo60. Thanks for looking!

Hi everyone,

Today I have up for trade my **Black FMJ built with a full Polycarbonate plate and Tealios** with GMK screw in stabilizers.

### Description

This board is arguably one of the most high quality keyboards I have ever owned and seen. The manufacturing is fantastic and the anodization is probably some of the best I’ve ever seen. The outer edges are filleted to give off a small mirrored surface. The stainless steel internal weight is engraved with a dragon design which is absolutely gorgeous. The tealios are very smooth and the stabilizers have been lubed with 205g0. There is one manufacturing defect on the inside of the escape key but it is barely noticeable. Overall, the board itself is in almost perfect condition with no other markings or dings.

### Looking for

I am primarily looking for these trades in this order:

- Lin Whale WKL + PayPal (Blue preferred)
- KFE
- Matrix 2.0 (not add)
- Matrix 1.2og + PayPal (Silver preferred)
- High end WKL TKL Offers *

*I am not interested in Rama or KBDfans boards

If you have your heart set on finding this board, **I will sell for $1450+shipping** but trades are preferable and will take priority. Payment methods can be either PayPal G&S or Zelle.

FMJ Does not come with hard shell case or OG Doubleshots but will be shipped very protected via USPS Priority.

Please PM and no reddit chat. Also feel free to PM with any questions you may have.

Thanks!

Hello everyone! Still trying to slim down the collection and need help! The M65-A was my first custom board ever, so it's a bittersweet end as it turns out I don't really need 6 keyboards.

Just noticed I didn't put anything in the title. It's a **Nautilus** set.

Selling my GMK Nautilus R1 Base set, I've used it for a quite some time, so there is an appearing shine on some keys, one of the worst probably being left control (added pic to show, in the pic it's on the right), though it isn't that bad. Other keys such as alphas are in still awesome shape, used only on an ANSI TKL. There is an unpackaged extras tray and the unused numberpad keys/different layout keys. Preferably EU.

I purchased this [GK64XS and these compatible PBT keycaps 2 months ago for about $185+.](http://imgur.com/a/oa0h2XX) I never ended up using it for a build so I was hoping I could sell it to someone looking for a decent hotswap beginner bundle and recover some of the cost I spent. This bundle includes all included material for the original GK64XS (Keycap puller, switch puller, extra screws, and usb C cable), aftermarket lubed and tuned GMK stabs which are better than those originally included, and the compatible PBT keycaps which fit the board's layout. Add some switches and this is a complete build for a beginner or someone wanting a budget hotswap with a heavy high quality aluminium case. The case is heavy coming in at 2.6 pounds or 1.2 Kg without switches or caps. This board has wireless and includes Bluetooth 5.1 and a 1800mAh battery. 

I'm pricing this at $150 shipped OBO
CONUS preferred, if in Europe please pay extra shipping cost.

Comes with original packaging, though the box is pretty destroyed at this point.  It's evident that the board is not full on NOS because there is a good bit of shine on the keycaps, but it feels and sounds bloody great!

*Sold for asking!*

I am looking to sell or trade away an Epomaker GK68XS barebones kit. It is the white plastic version with Bluetooth. The board has an optional split space bar module and comes assembled (except for the switches). It is a hotswap board and includes keycaps, but no switches. See [album](https://imgur.com/gallery/XjD64IP) for more images. A great board as a budget entry-level board or if you are looking for a cheap Bluetooth option. Oh and it has RGB backlighting (and underglow, apparently, but the case obviously blocks that). 

I only installed switches in the board once to test its function and everything works fine. The board and the keycaps are otherwise unused. I ordered this on IndieGoGo when I first got into the hobby a few months ago, but I am now into split ergo boards and have no use for it. The plastic version feels very good for the price and is better for Bluetooth connectivity than the aluminum case, from what I hear. 

I am asking for ~~70€ plus shipping~~ sold for asking. Shipping is 4,99€ inside Germany, 13,99€ within the EU and varies wildly outside of Europe. If you are outside the EU, please check DHL for prices and limitations due to the Coronavirus: https://www.dhl.de/en/privatkunden/pakete-versenden/weltweit-versenden/preise-international.html

Alternatively, I would trade for a cute/colorful set of keycaps that would fit a typical ortho or split board. These may obviously be used and cheaper caps, I am not expecting GMK sets, just something I enjoy that roughly fits the price mentioned above. Show me what you have and we’ll see if we can work something out.

Hey all, looking to sell a Silver Kokua to downsize my collection. Please see below for additional details.


* **Silver Kokua**
   * Comes with White Pom Plate from Sneakbox, note that it only supports stepped caps lock key.
   * Comes with a Hotswap USB-C Alice PCB from Sneakbox, preflashed with VIA (you have to load the layout for VIA to recognize it, [instructions here](https://github.com/SneakboxKB/AliceVIA)).
   * Millmax 7305 sockets were soldered for right split shift support.

Timestamp + Album: [https://imgur.com/a/ZShoGiK](https://imgur.com/a/ZShoGiK)

Cherry G80-1851 Sound tests, before + after modding: [https://imgur.com/a/KDVQPmR](https://imgur.com/a/KDVQPmR)

Vintage blacks sound test: [https://imgur.com/a/mH0SBEA](https://imgur.com/a/mH0SBEA)

The first thing that I have for sale is a Cherry G80-1851, manufactured in week 38 of 2004 (cherry date code Q38). This means (according to some community members) that the switches are most likely pretooled MX Blacks. Needless to say, they were pretty decent stock, slightly scratchy but not noticeable in the feeling or when typing quickly. The stabs were ass so I was quite motivated to mod this thing.

I desoldered the entire board, lubed the switches with krytox 205g0, lubed the stabilisers with 205g0 and dielectric grease, added shelf liner under the PCB, and it turned out great! It took me a very long time, **probably close to 8 hours for everything.** I really think that this could be endgame for someone. The switches are really excellent now, just slap on a GMK set, perhaps change the stock stabilisers for GMK screw ins (allows for screw ins), and you have yourself an excellent thocky board. I would also recommend cleaning the case a bit, but embrace the yellowing!

**For the Cherry G80-1851, I would be willing to part with it for 115 GBP + Shipping. I can ship worldwide, but shipping must be covered by the buyer.**

~~The 103x Vintage blacks are from a very heavily used 1991 Wyse board, which had a lot of shine on the doubleshot ABS keycaps. This board was extremely disgusting to take apart, it probably was never cleaned in its almost 30 years of life :( However, the switches are really nice! Please refer to the sound test. If I had a build lined up, I probably wouldn't even really bother lubing these.~~ **~~Also note that these are plate mount, and have 3 pins.~~**

**~~For the 103x Vintage blacks, I would like 90GBP + shipping. Again, I can ship worldwide, but shipping must be covered by the buyer.~~** SOLD 

Thanks everyone! Have a nice evening. Please note that payment is done via PayPal invoice only. **PLEASE COMMENT BEFORE PMing.**"

| [Purple KBD19x w/ Lubed Zealios V2 62g](https://imgur.com/a/gnwQl3D)| USD$210 + Shipping OBO| Several very small chips/dents, **KP ENTER DOES NOT WORK**, The spacebar stabs are a bit off and come out of place when you remove spacebar but are easy to put back. The specks in the pictures are not scratches, can just rub off.
| [Red KBD19x w/ Lubed Healios v2 // Lubed NK Drys Spring Swapped to 68g SPRiT Springs](https://imgur.com/a/j9Of7UA)| USD$220 + Shipping OBO| Bought this about a month ago and managed to get a bunch of scratches on a perfect board in world record time. I was planning on desoldering and changing all the switches to Healios V2s however I got lazy half way through and literally just changed the tops/stems/springs. The bottom left few keys you can see are fully resoldered with Healios v2s. look man, mistakes were made. Also this uses split left shift and a stepped capslock in the current build.|

**KAT Milkshake kits- Specialties, Alphas, Modifiers-**

\- in pretty pristine condition. I only typed on them for maybe 3 weeks; it felt amazing  but I found out my typing skills suck with KAT profile, so I'm switching back to cherry profile.  \***This will only be traded as a bundle**\- turns out that when receiving these sets sealed, the plastic trays were extremely warped, beyond being able to fit keycaps back in and close the tray tops; when returning some of the caps, I happened to mix alphas and mods (and probably some specialties) in one tray. In short, these 3 kits are pretty mixed, and I can't really split the kits individually. All keycaps are accounted for nevertheless.

**\*heavily prioritizing trades, but I may look to sell this bundle specifically. Asking price would be $360 USD however**

# Wants:

* 60-120 heavily worn in vintage black switches. The more consistent and smooth switches you have, the more per switch I'd be willing to put tack with any trade, or straight out buy
* keycult 1/60 wrist rest
* GMK Korean Beige add on
* [RAMA x B](https://mykeyboard.eu/media/cache/51/30/5130a47af566efb4045d8a2f55768455.jpg) keycaps

In terms of paypal, anything is negotiable. Not really looking to sell anything (maybe milkshake), but if you're interested, comment and PM,

Thanks!"

&#x200B;

I've taken on a few too many projects so it's time for me to let a few things go. Priority will go to bundles and people who send PMs with all their info, please no chats. I think my prices are fair, but I will consider all offers, please just be respectful :)

&#x200B;

SHIPPING to CONUS will be $10 for the keyboards and $5 for the PCBs. If you are international, please include your country and zip code in the PM and I will quote you.

&#x200B;

Custom Clueboard 66% in layered acrylic case with NK Creams - $160

* NK Creams lubed with 205g0
* pre-retooled (before they turned to crap) GMK stabs lubed with 205g0
* v2.5 PCB with underglow RGB LEDs flashed with VIA
* Custom cut layered acrylic case with Pearl top layer.
* Bottom foot is removable if you prefer a 0 degree board.
* Everything works, only real issue is with the acrylic top plate showing 3-4 cracks between switch holes from when this was rebuilt  - this doesn't impact how the switches fit at all, [see photos](https://imgur.com/a/fzo6pw8)
* BOARD NEEDS 3 SWITCHES SOLDERED TO BE COMPLETED - [YOU PICK THE LAYOUT](https://i.imgur.com/F8r8spn.png), I will solder the last switches in for whoever buys the board :)
   * stepped or centered CAPSLOCK
   * right of the spacebar 1u - 1.25u OR 1.25u - 1u

&#x200B;

Winkeyless layered Acrylic  22mini-B - OG 65% Korean custom - $160

* Gateron Silent Black Inks lubed with 205g0
* pre-retooled (before they turned to crap) GMK stabs lubed with 205g0
* 22mini PCB with underglow RGB LEDs flashed with QMK
* high profile custom Acrylic case with no visible hardware
* Everything works, this is one of the original customs from [Winkeyless.kr](https://Winkeyless.kr) (now defunct) in a very nicely cut acrylic case.
* The angled feet are removable if you prefer a 0 degree board.

&#x200B;

Built White Mysetrium PCB - **not working** \- $35

* PCB and soldered components only, this is NOT a complete kit.
* Everything was done to make the PCB look good: diodes are installed evenly...
* I soldered everything and when it came to test it, QMK toolbox wouldn't recognize it and pulling out the multi-meter is more time / work than I want to put into it right now.
* If i had to guess, it's most likely 1 of 3 things:
   * bad Atmega32A controller
   * I installed the resistors in the wrong positions
   * the USB type C is shorting (although it [doesn't look it from the photo](https://imgur.com/I5eg6Po))
* PCB is being **sold** **AS IS**, I give no guarantees that the PCB can be made to work.

&#x200B;

Hello mm,

Time for me to part ways with my first custom build. Sad, I know, but I've got plans for the future and future builds to think about now.

&#x200B;

~~[Savage65]~~(https://imgur.com/a/kmlVTmK) $450 SOLD for asking,  Round 1 A-stock Black, built with Creams lubed with 3204 and filmed on the 7u plate. GMK screw-ins clipped and lubed with 3204 on the sliders and dielectric grease on the wires. The hardware is included however I do not have the polyfil. Extra pcb, desoldered once, has GMK screw ins clipped and lubed with 3203 on sliders and dielectric grease on wires. 6.25u plate included as well.

No visual flaws on the case and both pcbs work just fine. The board sounds fantastic and the creams are heavily broken in/smooth. There is a thin layer of packing foam underneath the pcb, I'm leaving that in there. Both are currently split backspace built. [Beauty shots from a while back...](https://imgur.com/gallery/X9fxqtD)

**Violet Volt-80:** **~~Asking $600 + shipping~~** **Sold for $600 shipped.**

Long story short, the Volt-80 was actually what got me interested in this hobby, because I never knew a TKL could have such an unique design and key layout. I was so excited when they announced the 2020 extras I bought two (midnight and violet).

They took SO much longer shipping it than promised (I only JUST received them). I jumped on the Zenith as well for that unique layout too right after this and Wifey says one of these has got to go and so here is the Violet colorway up for grabs, sealed with shrink wrap still on box, along with dreams of putting the GMK VoC/ GMK Avanguardia on it....

Since purple is such a unique color, I put pictures in the links below to help you see what the shade of it will be, since this box is still sealed.

[Order Form](https://forms.gle/DDNRLh5G62tF1ebC9)

More details/FAQ/photos are on the order form so that this post doesn't end up being 5 pages long. Please read there. Any questions, please join the discord server for fastest reply.

If you miss this round and want to get the heads up on the next one, please fill out the [Notification Form](https://forms.gle/m5HEEXna7yMRCWdX6).

Timeline:

\-Form open: Now until 8pm Sunday Sept 27th, unless demand is obviously greater than what I can cut for

\-Invoices will go out between form close and 10pm EST, Sept 27th.

\-Payment due by 8pm EST, Sept 28th

\-Shipping no later than Friday Sept 30 - usually your stuff will ship in <24 hours from when you pay your invoice

If you are unwilling/unable to make this timeframe, please do not order.

Note: For the Mysterium and Discipline PLATE foam, these are now using 3mm to allow for flexier builds given the FR4 plate that is typically used on these builds. Case foam remains 6mm.

Because of the new [r/mm](https://www.reddit.com/r/mm/) rules on bulk selling, I CANNOT confirm trades for rep for foam stuff.

Hey MechMarket,

I’ve got a brand new, factory sealed GMK Phosphorous 40s/Ortho (Quarks) kit that I am looking to part with. I bought this as part of a full bundle to get the base kit, but I don’t have any use for it.

I paid approximately $85 plus shipping for it, and I’d like to sell it for the same to break even.

Only shipping to CONUS at this time.

This listing is **NOT FCFS**. I will review and respond to PMs as soon as I can.

FYI, as far as I know, there is no released date for GMK Phosphorous extras from The Key.Company yet.

As usual, please comment before PM, and please do not use reddit chat.

Black ano, untreated brass weight (what was offered), some specs in ano but nothing horrendous. Some damage on the back seam. 

Comes with two prototype PCBS in black, these are both VIA compatible. They also have flex cuts, pretty soft if you get a half plate.

Comes with a full CF plate from PKB and a half FR4 plate from Hiney that I cut myself. Does not come built, I will desolder, unless you like the builds you see.

Hi there,

I'm looking to let go of а few items in preparation for some upcoming GBs.

The first item is a R1 CA66 in dark red with badge, that I bought in December 2019 and have been keeping in its box since. It's built with Box Royals on a brass plate, and it comes with an extra alu plate in gold. The case has a tiny speck on the left edge, which is hard to see irl (check the last two photos in the album).

**CA66 – €440 + shipping** (around €468 shipped to EU, $556 shipped to US)

The second item is a R1 set of GMK Nines that I bought brand new from Emir (the set's designer) and used for about a week. The set is in excellent condition and shows no signs of use (see album).

~~**GMK Nines – €210 + shipping** (around €231 shipped to EU, $272 shipped to US)~~ — **SOLD**

I can offer a €20 discount if you're interested in buying both items as a bundle.

**Bundle – €630 + shipping** (around €660 shipped to EU, $780 shipped to US)

_All prices listed above are OBO. I am located in Serbia, Europe. The PayPal invoice will be in EUR._

**~~NK65 v2 Aluminum Edition Silver -~~**  ***~~$185 OBO~~*** ***~~+ Shipping~~***  ***Sold to TheHwangover***

**\*\*\*(PLEASE READ DETAILS BELOW)\*\*\***

One of the Kailh socket pads lifted, I soldered it to the diode and have not had any issues since then, board is fully functional. I can hotswap the key with no issues!

Does not come with keycaps!

Stabs have been clipped, lubed with Krytox 205g0 and band aid modded.

The outer case is pristine, always sat on my deskmat. Please see the below link for detailed images of each part.

Comes with Original box, box sleeve, cable, case and Via card

[Detailed Pictures of Board](https://imgur.com/a/H9bRxxJ)

EXTRA PCB AVAILABLE AT NK: [PCB from NK](https://novelkeys.xyz/collections/diy-kits/products/nk65-pcb)(PCB that comes with the board works just fine, but providing a link if you want a new PCB)

&#x200B;

**Keycap Set:**

**Infinikey Sanctuary Rebirth PBT Keycaps** \- ***$200 OBO +shipping***

Bought it from another user on/mm, was able to get the Crimson Cadet and only mounted it once and used for few hours. I did not like the sound of PBT compared to ABS (GMK). He also mounted it once before selling! I am trying to get back what I paid for.

The GH60 has 1.8mm leds soldered, so you will either need to desolder the LEDS OR use a switch that is open on the bottom--like any of the box switches below, which i will include for free.

$7 a bag:  old school box brown, box white, box royal and hako true switches.  at least 50 switches maybe more, will count before sending.  these are the OG ones that can/will crack caps so don't use them with caps that matter.  i kept them around for trash builds for friends (ha!) or meme builds (see above)."

&#x200B;

Hi everyone, looking to let go of my Analog Dreams set! I have a few other keysets coming in so I am looking to part with the set. Everything has been opened and used for a little less than a month. There is minimal to no shine on keycaps (I tried to picture it in my timestamp, can send more photos if needed). I want to try to keep this all in a bundle for a trade if possible. Will be shipped in bags or trays based on what we work out.

[TIMESTAMP](https://imgur.com/a/hPy8W0m) (boards pictured not for sale)

&#x200B;

I am looking for a mid to low tier board to trade the whole bundle. A polycarb KBD67 MKII would be the dream trade if possible, but I am really open to any boards near that price point (built or unbuilt, but pref for unbuilt). If needed I can add paypal on my end too. If I don't find any trades I am willing to part the set with, I am looking for **$350 shipped** for the bundle. This is around what I payed for everything, I am not really trying to make any money. Just hopefully looking for someone who wants this set and is willing to make a trade! Again, I am prioritizing trades so I likely will not negotiate with buyers until I am unable to find a trade. 

&#x200B;

I am also looking for a shirouu nekomata artisan if anyone is willing to sell theirs :)

&#x200B;

Thanks for looking, and please PM me if you have any questions about anything (can also message me on discord: Pumice#4504)!

***SOLD for asking*** ~~GMK Voyage - $220 Shipped in bag / Base Kit only. Used for a week, no shine that I could see.~~

KBD67v2 mkii - $350 Shipped / Black soldered kit with filmed and lubed Alpacas. Built with case and plate foam and C3 stabs. I didn't notice any issues with scratches on the case at all but there are some screw issues. [Circled](http://imgur.com/a/eEtf9s0) are the screw holes that appear to be stripped so the screws won't stay in. Now before it was soldered I used millmax sockets to test pcb (not soldered in) and there was only 1 screw that I could not get to stay in. I am thinking that when it was soldered perhaps the plate foam wasn't compressed enough to allow the other screws to screw in? I am not sure though, but I wanted to disclose everything. I will also be including a hotswap pcb and plate shown [here](http://imgur.com/a/NrShKRK). I was told that the pcb needs an isp flash? but I do not have the ability to do that so I will be including it with the board."

Item | Condition/Details | Price?
---|---|----
Infinkey WoB | Used for about 2 weeks. Unwarped spacebars. | Trades
Gat ink v2s | 67 ink v2s. I'm weird so I spring swapped the alphas with 80g tx springs. I can spring swap them back or include the original springs. 15 are stock.| $90 / trades
Tofu 65 Build | Tofu 65 case, dz65 v2 rgb hot swap pcb, mkultra foam, brass plate, can throw in cherry stabs too. Case was grey but is spray painted black with 2 coats primer, 2 coats black. Doesn't look bad, but since it is spray painted I can consider not including  it if you're looking for the other parts. I'm willing to part everything but the case, but not individual items.| $270 / trades

I can consider bundling these together for a discount. Prices are negotiable.

What I'm looking for:

- KAT Milkshake. mainly looking for mods, alphas and fruits

Hey all, I received my order of GMK coral a couple of weeks ago and I have since found that I really prefer sets with more subtle colorways. I am open to trades offers for any GMK sets with neutral colors or earth tones, especially GMK Cafe. Examples of other sets I'm interested in are \[Botanical, Olive, Ursa, Camping\].  


The set is in great condition, I've maybe used it for an hour total.  


I would prefer a trade but if I can't find someone to trade with I'll sell the bundle for $280 shipped CONUS (or best offer)."

Hey r/mm!

I'm Buddy and I have been customizing Topre keyboards for the most part of 2020. I spent months of trial and error and RnD to be able to get the best feeling I can from my keyboards. My most recent project was this HHKB that I have for sale.

* [Typing Demonstration Quality Audio](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yN6NycL6JfOtmuMmZ7xakN6e24AlD8_B%60) (Rode NT1-A Condenser Microphone)

This keyboard is [gutted](https://i.imgur.com/d2NXNzH.jpg), [shaved](https://i.imgur.com/EROzK5j.jpg), painted, and[ filled with weights](https://i.imgur.com/muKdxcE.jpg).  At **over 2 lbs, It is a staggering 82% heavier than a normal HHKB!**  This item is considered **B-STOCK** and is priced accordingly.

The ports have been shaved, that is, bondoed and block sanded smooth, for an ultra clean look.  Due to this the DIP switches can only be changed by disassembly of the keyboard housing and the [USB port](https://i.imgur.com/EJsnPOt.jpg) requires a [compatible USB cable](https://i.imgur.com/hyL0TgM.jpg), with a thin end wrapped in a shrink tube.

Here is [my guide](https://www.unrealkeyboards.com/Guides/topre-modifications/) to all the modifications done.

**Info**

Just getting rid of some items I have excess of and looking for a good home!

Items are not FCFS, are OBRO, and shipping not included. It's also generally helpful if messages are clear and actionable (provide ZIP and PayPal so I can quote shipping quickly). Unless they are marked as sold, they are still available.

CONUS shipping only because shipping internationally is not easy, especially with the pandemic.

Discord: flatwhite#0009 - I probably will respond to discord messages faster.

Reddit: PM only, I will not respond to any chats. Comment before PM'ing please.

**For Sale:**

Hey y’all
Selling a couple boards

Akko 3084- lubed the mx blues to make them more like browns but more tactile feeling on alphas cuz I’m weird. Have beige and gray keycap set I can throw in that fits on it for 10 dollars more if you don’t like stock keycaps. 60+ shipping—— sold local ——-

GK64x- BoX jades. Clipped -lubed - and bandaid modded stock stabs. Stock plastic black case. Has split space bar mod it came with that will be included. Period hotswap on pcb fell off, you can fix it if you want For pretty cheap I just haven’t felt like doing it. Comes with those 9009 YMDK dsa profile caps and matching aviator cable(not my best work oof,  But works fine). 85 + shipping 

KBD fans walnut 60% case- few knicks but overall still great condition. Comes with matching wrist rest. 40+ shipping. ——pending——

Prefer shipping UPS or FedEx cuz the USPS by me is literally the worst place ever. 

OBO if you think prices are off but I think that’s what I would pay for them. 


Would love GMK Sam too for trade of one of these plus little cash cuz drop shipping times are insane and I’ll have blue Sam by then so. 

Pm any questions!! :)"

Hey MM!

&#x200B;

Today for sale I have some doubleshot PBT keycaps in the BoW and WoB colorway. These come from the same molds and manufacturer as the widely popular NovelKeys BoW and Vaporwave. These are excellent, thick, doubleshot PBT keycaps that have really nice, crisp legends. They also feature 0 warp [https://imgur.com/a/MXUFvRP](https://imgur.com/a/MXUFvRP), unlike a certain GMK WoB keyset.

&#x200B;

|Doubleshot WoB|3|$85 Shipped with Priority.|

|Doubleshot BoW|7|$85 Shipped with Priority.|

This includes 1.75u rshift, 7u, 6u, 2.25 and 2.75u spacebars, 1u mods, 1.5u mods, 1.25u mods, and 65% keys. should fit most boards.

Note: These are not keycaps from Novelkeys, but are from the same molds and same factory and are the same quality. They're exactly the same, just without the novelkeys branding. Cherry profile.

US and canada only, canada will be using first class international and there will be an additional shipping fee. keycaps and switches shipped in bags, with foam padding.

I can ship with Box for an additional fee.

Edit: Sold out. I'll ship out on monday. I think i'll be getting some stock of both soon (1-2 weeks), if you want a set, keep your eyes out!  👀

Up for trade/sale today is some gat ink v2s and a tofu 65 hotswap build.



Item | Condition/Details | Price?

Gat ink v2s | 67 ink v2s. I'm weird so I spring swapped the alphas with 80g tx springs. I can spring swap them back or include the original springs. 15 are stock.| $90 / trades
Tofu 65 Build | Tofu 65 case, dz65 v2 rgb hot swap pcb, mkultra foam, brass plate, can throw in cherry stabs too. Case was grey but is spray painted black with 2 coats primer, 2 coats black. Doesn't look bad, but since it is spray painted I can consider not including  it if you're looking for the other parts. I'm willing to part everything but the case, but not individual items.| $270 / trades

I can consider bundling these together for a discount. Prices are negotiable.

What I'm looking for:

- GMK keycaps. Open to most, already have a WoB set though, so anything outside of that.
- SA keycaps. Mainly interested in SA Chalk, SA Ice Caps, and SA WoB, but if you have another type let me know!
- KAT Milkshake. mainly looking for mods, alphas and fruits
- Can add paypal on my end."

**GMK Sky Dolch and EnjoyPBT Sky Dolch mix/match:** So, a bit of a back story here, I bought a set of GMK Sky Dolch from somebody that was missing some of the modifiers so I bought an entire set of EnjoyPBT Sky Dolch ABS that are eerily similar to fill out what I was missing. Unfortunately, I was an idiot and mixed all the keycaps in one bag so now I have no idea which keys come from which set. I'm sure somebody with a better-trained eye will be able to tell which keys are from which set. **ONLY includes the keycaps included in the picture.** PLEASE look very carefully before buying. **$80**

**GMK RGBYOD modifiers:** never used. **$40**

Hey r/mm!

I'm Buddy and I have been customizing Topre keyboards for the most part of 2020. I spent months of trial and error and RnD to be able to get the best feeling I can from my keyboards. My most recent project was this HHKB that I have for sale.

* [Typing Demonstration Quality Audio](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yN6NycL6JfOtmuMmZ7xakN6e24AlD8_B%60) (Rode NT1-A Condenser Microphone) 

This keyboard is [gutted](https://i.imgur.com/d2NXNzH.jpg), [shaved](https://i.imgur.com/EROzK5j.jpg), painted, and[ filled with weights](https://i.imgur.com/muKdxcE.jpg).  At **over 2 lbs, It is a staggering 82% heavier than a normal HHKB!**  This item is considered **B-STOCK** and is priced accordingly.

The ports have been shaved, that is, bondoed and block sanded smooth, for an ultra clean look.  Due to this the DIP switches can only be changed by disassembly of the keyboard housing and the [USB port](https://i.imgur.com/EJsnPOt.jpg) requires a [compatible USB cable](https://i.imgur.com/hyL0TgM.jpg), with a thin end wrapped in a shrink tube.

Here is [my guide](https://www.unrealkeyboards.com/Guides/topre-modifications/) to all the modifications done.

* [Sliders](https://i.imgur.com/mUCR9Xm.jpg): JTK MX Sliders, Topre Spacebar, Deskeys Silencing Rings #3, Krytox 205g2+105

Hey everyone, I got a Tofu65. It has the Tada68 PCB. As for the switches, they are cherry clears spring-swapped with 65g springs and lubed with 3204. It has an aluminum top plate, gmk screw-in stabs, and a brass weight on the bottom. Only problem with this keyboard is a scratch on the brass weight on the bottom. This scratch can be seen in the timestamp pictures.

1. Laser Low Profile ALT Hotswappable

Pictures: [https://photos.app.goo.gl/aMssApWCbGqzWeGv8](https://photos.app.goo.gl/aMssApWCbGqzWeGv8)

Lovely purple aluminum board. Comes with its magnetic feet.The stabilizers were lubed and bandaid modded. I later added (see time stamp) nice clicky gateron box white switches and a some random keycaps that i had lying around (didnt have a space bar keycap). You will need USB-C for it to work but other than that this keyboard should be good to go. It is hotswap-able so you can replace the box white switches.

Asking $195

2. Red inked switches - lubed 67 switches (lubed with 205g0/105 on spring and filmed with ThiccFilms) by [u/tatojang](https://www.reddit.com/u/tatojang/). Legs clipped as well so you can put these into most keyboards.

Sorry uploading now because I got caught up the past week x

Note: The caps are on the board but are being sold separately to allow for more manageable purchases. If you'd like to buy them as a bundle as shown all together that isn't a problem and do let me know :)

Hey! I'm looking to sell off my ducky miya pro board along with 2 sets of keycaps. Pricing and extra information on the board are as follows (costs include shipping and paypal fees):

&#x200B;

|Item|Condition|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Ducky Miya Pro Sakura + Original Sakura Keycaps ([Sound Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJpjjjqQFKM)) - Everglide Oreo switches lubed with Krytox 205g0 including legs (I prefer the smoothness and the tactility of these switches are still preserved as you can hear)|Used Moderately.  See extra notes (1) for the small mistakes I made on the board. The board is a pleasure to type on and I'll provide a sound test too. They're thocky and are the only tactile switches I've been able to use daily. Some switches (visible i the photos - free to ask specifics) are different as I was playing around with the ergonomic feel. One pink LED in the spacebar.|£200 - I am open to offers so feel free to pm  :)|
|~~GMK First Love (Base Kit)~~|~~Opened and used for 2 weeks. I can't see much or any shine on them and they're a lovely set of caps. Comes in original Styrofoam/card trays~~|~~£210 (negotiable)~~|
|~~C³  Tangerines Latest Group buy 62g (linear) x90~~|~~Brand new - Shipped out and opened a few to see if they've been lubed. They have been lightly lubed from factory giving them a light and very smooth feel in my opinion. If you need an extra few let me know.~~|~~£95 (negotiable)~~|

Extra notes: (1) Two keys don't work which are the (\[ and +) keys. Also the nk cream switch in the spacebar is holding down the wire of the solder connector so if you ever decide to switch the switch out for another make sure to keep that wire in there while soldering. dm me for any extra information you'd like :)

Shipping costs! I'm willing to pay for shipping within the UK without a problem. For the EU we'll get an invoice and I'll let you know how much it comes up to. I'm willing to pay up to £5 for EU shipping and the rest will be on you.

Thanks a ton for reading!"

Selling my MK67. It's a fantastic keyboard, comes with brass plate, Novelkey Cream Switches, Case Foam, and the Grey Case. I've band-aid modded (w/ Stabilizer Pads from Upgrade Keyboards), lubed, and swapped the stabs. It has a slight rattle on the right side of the spacebar, but no real ping, and all the other stabs sound great. Overall a great entry custom, and one that sounds / feels nearly as good as my Koyu. Only has about a month of use under its belt. Looking for $400 for it, shipped.

Ergodox Infinity comes as pictured built with Brown switches. Only about half of the keycaps are currently on it. If you'd like to have the keycaps that come with it let me know and I'll put them back on. Looking for 210 + shipping here, under what I paid for it recently b/c I found an unbuilt kit. 

Also have 75 (I think? Can count if interested). Cherry MX Speed Silvers desoldered from a board. Looking for $30 + shipping here. These are in the tangerine case. They are not tangerines.

Hey r/mm!

I'm Buddy and I have been customizing Topre keyboards for the most part of 2020. I spent months of trial and error and RnD to be able to get the best feeling I can from my keyboards. My most recent projects are this HHKB and NiZ Plum 84 that I have for sale.

Here is [my guide](https://www.unrealkeyboards.com/Guides/topre-modifications/) to all the modifications done.

&#x200B;

**Sky Dolch HHKB**

* [Typing Demonstration Quality Audio](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sUZiJP6-bsQQDTbiStdsljBPUjs9DIXh/) (Rode NT1-A Condenser Microphone)

This keyboard is [gutted](https://i.imgur.com/d2NXNzH.jpg), [shaved](https://i.imgur.com/EROzK5j.jpg), painted, and[ filled with weights](https://i.imgur.com/muKdxcE.jpg).  At **over 2 lbs, It is a staggering 82% heavier than a normal HHKB!**  With 3 coats of urethane clear, it has a deep gloss that’s sure to stand the test of time. This item is considered **B-STOCK** and is priced accordingly.

The ports have been shaved, that is, bondoed and block sanded smooth, for an ultra clean look.  Due to this the DIP switches can only be changed by disassembly of the keyboard housing and the [USB port](https://i.imgur.com/EJsnPOt.jpg) requires a [compatible USB cable](https://i.imgur.com/hyL0TgM.jpg), with a thin end wrapped in a shrink tube.

* Keys: GMK Sky Dolch
* Domes: Uniform 45g
* [Sliders](https://i.imgur.com/mUCR9Xm.jpg): JTK MX Sliders, Topre Spacebar, Deskeys Silencing Rings #3, Krytox 205g2+105
* [Stabilizers](https://i.imgur.com/lnNZvM0.jpg): Deskeys Silencing Rings #3, Krytox 203g2+105. Shrink tube and Krytox 205g2 for stabilizer bars.

This NiZ Plum 84 comes with Topre 45g domes, has a painted base plate, a matching spacebar, and is housed in a Pearl Black case with a deep gloss and automotive-like finish. It has a [custom laser cut gasket](https://www.unrealkeyboards.com/Shop) installed between the painted base plate and the slider housings, making the keyboard noticeably less rattly with an improved feeling of rigidity in the upstroke.  Also, 10.75 oz of adhesive weights fill the case making this keyboard **44% heavier** than original!

Looking to sell a built Clueboard v3/v4 which I got off another user here. Details of the build are as follows -

1. Clueboard v3/v4 Grey Alu Top and Bottom with acrylic diffuser
2. Clueboard PCB (mini USB) soldered with -
   1. Chellow  switches (retooled Cherry housing with Gateron yellow stem and spring  lubed with Krytox 205g0 for the stem, legs, housing and spring) on  alphas and numbers
   2. Retooled Cherry MX black switches on the modifiers (lubed with Krytox 205g0 for the stem, legs, housing and spring)
   3. 1x Durock screw-in purple and gold stab for the spacebar (lubed with Krytox 205g0)
   4. 2x GMK screw-in stabs for the enter key and left shift key (lube with Krytox 205g0)
   5. PCB is configured as split backspace, split right shift, and the bottom row is ==> (1.25)(1.25)(1.25)(6.25)(1.25)(1)(1.25)
3. Clueboard acrylic bottom (Extra)
4. KBDFans XDA keycap set (All extra keycaps will be included)
5. Screw-In Stabilizers from Tokyo60 (2 x 2u and 1 x 7u) (Extra add on)
6. Wood Cable Mini USB to USB-A (5 feet, Mini USB to USB-A, Gray Heatshrink, Cream Paracord, and Clear Techflex)
7. 2x Neoprene foam cut out and placed below the PCB for sound dampening. Keyboard goes thocc thocc.

\*\*Note:  The clueboard has a small scuff (pictured in the timestamp) in the  front. Received the board in this condition. There are no other scuffs  or dings on the board. Also from the previous owner - ""\*\****One  thing to note is that I tried fixing one of the underglow LEDs since   it was not working but ended up lifting some of the pads.""***

**I  used this board for a couple of weeks but never used the underglow  since the bottom of the case was stuffed with neoprene foam for sound  dampening.**

I am moving to college within a week so I’m trying to get rid of my stuff so that my parents don’t have to deal with it and to raise some funds for tuition. With that said, I’m not looking to split the items, and I will be quite generous if you want to make an offer, but please don’t lowball – I am familiar with the going prices of my stuff so lowballs will immediately be ignored.

|Item|Description|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|
|[Silver Modern M0110](https://imgur.com/a/GDtPhNm) **Sold**|Serial number #005, comes with the engraving pictured. Not everyone will agree with me but I think the engraving is a nice little homage to the original M0110. Exterior is perfect; was originally assembled by me but the PCB had a defective key and I tried to fix it by flashing new firmware but it stopped working completely. But fear not! It comes with an extra XD60 PCB. It’ll also come with the old PCB (in case you want to try your hand at fixing it) which has GMK screw-in stabs. Brass plate is a little tarnished but can easily be cleaned. I would’ve but I don’t have enough time|$500|
|[XDA Oblique kits](https://imgur.com/a/MuKl2eR) **Sold**|Modern (M0110), accents, and numpad kits. Mounted on the Modern M0110 but never used.|$140|
|[Silver Duck Raven](https://imgur.com/a/Y4IeNNu)|No imperfections besides a hairline scratch on the backside. Currently has vintage blacks and a polycarb plate. I stopped following the discussions surrounding what qualifies an MX black to be “vintage” (like what year they’re from and what board they were taken from), so all I remember is that they were listed as used vintage blacks, then I ultrasonically cleaned them. They really are the bee’s knees. Comes with an extra pcb and a stainless steel alps plate.|$230|
|[GMK Serika Geometries](https://imgur.com/a/OkOwcLs) **Sold**|Never opened|$55|
|[Ducky pocket](https://imgur.com/a/krzwxoI) **Sold**|Gateron Blues, exterior looks good|$50|
|[Gray KBDfans 5° case](https://imgur.com/a/TysMRKC) **Sold**|Exterior is perfect, but there are scratches on the inside where the edge of the PCB would be. Not noticeable when assembled, but I can provide more pictures if requested|$45|
|[Jelly Key Constellation Enter the Stars artisan](https://imgur.com/a/YPHggln) **Sold**|I don’t know much about this since I’m not the original owner, but it’s all shiny and there’s no scratches. SA profile|$28|
|[Jelly Key Constellation keycap](https://imgur.com/a/kj8wwus) **Sold**|Also not the original owner; no scratches. Looks like GMK profile but the top is flat|$23|
|[Clueboard 60% PCB](https://imgur.com/a/ojQpNiZ) **Sold**|Never used|$20|
|[Nexus Alps sliders, housings, stabilizers](https://imgur.com/a/yGykhks)|100x housings and sliders, 1 set of stabilizers. Never modified, stabs were separated but never completed so you can see a bit of plastic sticking out from them|$100|
|[KeLorean Toilet Artisan](https://imgur.com/a/8nvRTaL)|”Pee-yellow” – pretty silly artisan if I do say so myself|$38|
|[Jelly Key Autumn Festival Moon Cake Artisan](https://imgur.com/a/WnS3JNl) **Sold**|Comes with the wood box and tag, looks pristine|$23|
|[Orange Utan Fugu](https://imgur.com/a/qNUV5XE)|Not the original buyer, everything looks good|$30|
|[Nautilus-themed USB cable](https://imgur.com/a/GHHHcYZ) **Pending**|3ft mini-B, never used.|$15|
|[Mechcables Carbon custom-sleeved USB cable](https://imgur.com/a/VMq95JZ) **Sold**|Mini-B, never used. Carbon Cream And Gray w/ Carbon Techflex, 5ft, 7"" coil|$25|
|[Novelkeys Nautilus Desk Mat](https://imgur.com/a/mlzIOVl) **Sold**|90cm long, 40cm across (35x15in). Used for like a day then promptly wrapped back up; as clean as it’s ever gonna be|$15|

Trying to put out a feeler to see if there are any fun trades out there.

I was really excited to get it and I still quite enjoy it, but the 65% layout with detached arrow cluster is really hard for me to get used to (I use HHKB FN layout and having the Fn on the detached 'up' arrow key which is just slightly away from position seems to throw me off).

*(1 alu plate has been filed down by prior owner as it was slightly miscut for the switches - it works but the filing is visually apparent. Job was well done, though, imo).

Hi Mechmarket!

Today I have for sale:

Space65 - built with YOK Holy Pandas lightly lubed with krytox205g0, lubed durock stabs, black alu plate and black badge - board is in amazing condition except for flaw listed below

\*Note - This board has a big flaw in that the up and down arrow keys do not work as well as backslash, up and down arrow keys are remapped to pgup and pgdn directly to the side so not that inconvenient I suppose : ( . I believe this is a fixable issue on the pcb, can provide pictures of pcb if interested as well as a sound test : )

Hey all,

I'm looking to sell my white Satisfaction 75. This is 14/250 and I am the original owner and builder of this board. The PCB is built to be hot swappable using soldered mill max sockets. It currently has Holy Pandas installed. I used this for about a month before going to back to a 60%. It's a fantastic board that has been built and cared for meticulously. 


Includes all original kit components, white OLED with plastic cover still in place, gold stock knob, RAMA gold knob, standard brass plate, Cannon Keys sleeve, GMK Minimal + split space kit, RAMA Escape, Holy Pandas, clear/gold screw in stabilizers. I will also include extra mill max sockets as well as a RAMA switch puller for swapping switches. 


Price: $2,300 shipped. Please only PM if serious. I'm happy to answer questions or provide more photos.


Thanks!

Hello, I'm selling [braided USB cables](https://imgur.com/iydpTDo) that are braided with a 4 strand round braid. I started making these to match a gmk set (Darling) and felt the match was better than what I could have made with coils. There are so many possibilities with colorways and patterns!

All cables will be around 5 feet +/- an inch

They are also all USB-A to USB-C except for one. (check notes)

If you're interested please PM me the cable you want and your PayPal email, name, and shipping address, will send invoice as soon as possible.

I plan to use all sales to experiment and produce more cables of this style. Thanks for checking out this post! (more evangelion cables in the future)

Levinson 40% ortholinear split keyboard: Built with Holy Pandas (made with YOK panda housings, halo true stems, 67g springs, lubed with 205g0). The build has the tenting holes available and a frosted acrylic middle layer so the RGB is diffused very nicely. It had a super small crack on a couple of the corners which I've fixed with super glue. I've included images but you might not even be able to tell where it was lol. Top layer is black acrylic, and the input type is Type-C. Overall a great board, just don't use it as much as I've taken to other layouts lately. Bundled as: Left Half & Right Half with holy pandas soldered and TRRS Cable

[Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/Xe0mnlw?nc=1)

Got myself a nice Duck Raven so looking to find this board a nice new home!

Looking to sell a built Clueboard v3/v4 which I got off another user here. Details of the build are as follows -

1. Clueboard v3/v4 Grey Alu Top and Bottom with acrylic diffuser
2. Clueboard PCB (mini USB) soldered with -
   1. Chellow switches (retooled Cherry housing with Gateron yellow stem and spring lubed with Krytox 205g0 for the stem, legs, housing and spring) on alphas and numbers
   2. Retooled Cherry MX black switches on the modifiers (lubed with Krytox 205g0 for the stem, legs, housing and spring)
   3. 1x Durock screw-in purple and gold stab for the spacebar (lubed with Krytox 205g0)
   4. 2x GMK screw-in stabs for the enter key and left shift key (lube with Krytox 205g0)
   5. PCB is configured as split backspace, split right shift, and the bottom row is ==> (1.25)(1.25)(1.25)(6.25)(1.25)(1)(1.25)
3. Clueboard acrylic bottom (Extra)
4. KBDFans XDA keycap set (All extra keycaps will be included)
5. Screw-In Stabilizers from Tokyo60 (2 x 2u and 1 x 7u)
6. Wood Cable Mini USB to USB-A (5 feet, Mini USB to USB-A, Gray Heatshrink, Cream Paracord, and Clear Techflex)
7. 2x Neoprene foam cut out and placed below the PCB for sound dampening. Keyboard goes thocc thocc.

\*\*Note: The clueboard has a small scuff (pictured in the timestamp) in the front. Received the board in this condition. There are no other scuffs or dings on the board. Also from the previous owner - ""\*\****One thing to note is that I tried fixing one of the underglow LEDs since  it was not working but ended up lifting some of the pads.""***

**I used this board for a couple of weeks but never used the underglow since the bottom of the case was stuffed with neoprene foam for sound dampening.**

&#x200B;

Looking to sell everything as a bundle for $230 (inclusive of PayPal G&S feed and shipping via USPS Priority). I can use UPS or FedEx if the buyer wants a faster mode but it will be at an extra cost.

Can separate the build as follows -

1. Clueboard with extra bottom, wood cable and stabs for $200 shipped.
2. KBDFans XDA keycap set for $60 shipped.

**[Timestamp](https://i.imgur.com/QpAKrNV.jpg)**

EDIT: [Audio sound test](https://vocaroo.com/UXbLl6j0FYS) since I realized I didn't include one and people have been asking. Also, here's a [picture with GMK WoB](https://i.imgur.com/j0KtcMc.jpg) on it to give you an example of how red it is and what the layout will be. Left thumb cluster, is incorrectly spaced, however, as I didn't have the keys to properly kit it. It should be a 1.5U mod, 2U spacebar, then a 1.25U mod. 

**Price: $180 shipped CONUS** I will consider international shipping if the buyer pays for shipping. Can also do local sale; local to the SF Bay Area

**Specs:**

* Case: [Open source half-plate case files](https://github.com/Zambumon/Lubrigante) cut through Ponoko
* PCB: [Project Keyboard Rev2 Alice PCB - USB Mini](https://store.projectkeyboard.com/collections/alice-pcbs/products/alice-pcb-rev2-black)
* Switches: [NK Creams](https://novelkeys.xyz/products/novelkeys-cream-switches) lubed with 205g0 and springs lubed with 105. Also filmed with Kebo films
* Stabs: [Zeal 2U stabs](https://zealpc.net/collections/switches/products/zealstabilizers?variant=27196398790) lubed with 205g0. Left shift and left space bar was a bit sluggish when I first built it, but after use, it got a lot better. As a heads up, they may not feel as super smooth as the right space, enter, and backspace. 


I built this because I wanted to try the Alice layout on the cheap without having to spend a lot in case I didn't like it. While I really liked the layout, I found myself using it less and less recently. I figured I would be able to pass this board to someone who may want to try the layout for themselves as well without having to invest a lot into it.

~~Hi selling some items that I'm not using since I just purchased some products from this community and would like to recoup some of the costs haha.~~

I believe I paid $220 for this GMK set NEW from another user, I would like~~ **~~$160 SHIPPED~~**~~, the caps will be in a bag and shipped in a box for clarification (Sorry I don't have the trays!)~~

~~As an FYI they are still able to be pre ordered on Drop and I believe they ship around end of November? For me it showed as total cost was $148.17 w/ free shipping to CA. If you're fine paying extra couple  bucks you could have this set way sooner!~~

**~~BDN9 Macropad~~**~~-   Has 2 rotary encoders with knobs, built with c3 tangerines 62g lubed with Krytox 205g0 in an Acrylic case. (COPY/ PASTED from Original Post). According to the owner who built this the SMD leds they soldered on does not work. My knowledge on soldering is at a bare minimum so I did not bother trying to fix it myself. Other than that it works perfectly! This is flashed with VIA so you can adjust things to your liking there! I originally paid $60 shipped from the original seller, I am wanting~~ **~~$40 SHIPPED. There's a darling in the franxx~~**

**~~KeyHive May Pad~~**~~-  Built with MX reds, lubed with 205g0, clipped in stabs. I added 205g0 to the stabilizers if you're curious. I originally paid $60 shipped. My asking price~~ **~~35$ SHIPPED~~**~~, I never changed any keymaps to this so it acts as a regular numpad.~~  **~~There's a darling in the franxx on the back of this. If you'd like me to remove it please let me know. Other than that if no mention I will just leave it on~~**

~~I have Hako Clears pictured first person to ask in their PM can take them as long as if you're purchasing an item, they're pre retooled so I don't know how it'll affect your keycaps. Back story I purchased a KONO Kira from another user and took them off since I didn't need them. There's a total of 99 I believe? But I'll just say 90.~~

~~I purchased these along with the mechlovin pcb in hopes of finding a near-endgame red tkl. However, that obviously didn't happen and I'm receving my R2 kuro shiro soon, so these gotta go! I mounted them once and typed to see the difference between epbt and GMK, other than that, never used. So the condition is near-new.~~

&#x200B;

**~~MechLovin' Infinity 87 Standard PCB - USD $50 + shipping~~** **SOLD**

~~Like the BoWs, the board I hoped to have by this time never happened, so I don't have a need for this PCB. Literally just took it out for the timestamp picture (hence the bubble wrap). I purchased this at $48 + $25 shipping, so I believe this price is fair?~~

&#x200B;

**SA Grab bags - USD $10 each, or $40 for all (shipping extra)**

Purchased from KBDfans earlier in the year, again, didn't know I wouldn't like the SA profile so here we are. I separated them by color/set (I think), so saves you some time i guess. Never typed on, just sorted after I received them.

&nbsp;

Detailed Photos: https://imgur.com/a/dAC4u1n 

&nbsp;

Background: Paid 150ish for the keyboard and 15 bucks for the GMK stabilizers back in January of this year. Stabs are clipped and lubed, PCB has bandaid mod, the casing has dampening foam at the bottom to improve sound. I’m vouched on FRBST and have 4 Trades on Mech Market, 3 Purchases on Apple Swap, & 2 Purchases on PhotoMarket.

&nbsp;

Details: **Selling the whole set for 90 bucks + shipping.** The reason for the cheap pricing is because there is a loose connection on the switch connector for the D key which needs to be replaced (Diagnosed in this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/he2lz4/gold_to_whoever_can_help_me_fix_my_massdrop_alt_d/). On the bright side it is a 10 cent replacement part (https://kbdfans.com/products/mechanical-keyboard-switches-kailh-pcb-socket) and I’ve estimated that the soldering should be around 20 bucks as well or free if you have a soldering kit lol. Aside from the D key everything else works perfect and the main reason why I’m selling is because I bought a GMMK TKL where I utilize the 75% keyboard more efficiently for work. Some light scratches from daily use but aside from that it's in amazing condition. Selling as is, just the keyboard no cords."

Hello, I'm selling [braided USB cables](https://imgur.com/iydpTDo) that are braided with a 4 strand round braid. I started making these to match a gmk set (Darling) and felt the match was better than what I could have made with coils. There are so many possibilities with colorways and patterns!

Shipping will be $4 USPS First-Class Mail CONUS only

All cables will be around 5 feet +/- an inch

They are also all USB-A to USB-C except for one. (check notes)

If you're interested please PM me the cable you want and your PayPal email, name, and shipping address, will send invoice as soon as possible.

I plan to use all sales to experiment and produce more cables of this style. Thanks for checking out this post!

*COMMENT BEFORE PM*

Hey MechMarket, I’m selling my ever first build in preparation for a new board I’m planning sometime soon. This originally cost me about $220 before taxes and whatnot, so I suppose it’s only right to ask about $175+ Shipping, but it’s always negotiable.

A point of notice in the keyboard is the enter key, which has a broken stabilizer, which I clipped off. The key itself still functions and feels normal, but has a little bit more wobble, but I found it to be perfectly tolerable. It’s also very possible to fix it if you wanted to. It has an acrylic case in great condition which definitely makes the RGB under glow look much smoother. The keycaps are also PBT.

If you’re in or near East Los Angeles, I would also consider a trade for GMK Vaporwave, a case, switches + cash, etc."

**Space65 dark blue (with brass badge)** : Its currently built but I have an extra sealed PCB + brass plate  so you will have a clean slate (I will keep my built PCB). Great condition, the brass badge has some light scratches near the USB-C port.

**Want:** White, Egg, or Red Space65, just the case is fine. I'm **willing to add $100 on top**. **No buy now price** because I really like this board, I just want a different color and I'm too lazy to get it cerakoted.

Both boards have a great thocc and are super smooth (as expected from the switches used).

Got to make room for future projects, so letting go of a couple of things today.  
1) Filco Minila Air - £55  
2) Cherry G80-8000 - £65  
3) SA WoB (Maxkey) - £75  
4) XDA Godspeed - MT3 godspeed

Description:  
1) Thought this one would be a fixer-upper but after I gave it a cleanup it was pretty nice! Probably the most solid stock keeb I've tried. As you may expect, the browns aren't the most tactile, but they actually feel pretty smooth and sound quite nice. Here are some sound tests: [with OEM keycaps](https://i.imgur.com/XTEXgUn.mp4) [with GMK keycaps](https://i.imgur.com/gqNuYLp.mp4) [with PBT XDA profile keycaps](https://i.imgur.com/QdDJlqG.mp4).  
There are [DIP switches](https://deskthority.net/wiki/File:Filco_Minila_backplate_1.jpeg) at the back so you can change a few things about the layout. Sadly I only have the OEM keycaps for the layout in the picture.  
I know layout compatibility can be a real issue with Minilas, so if you're planning to use it with Cherry profile keycaps I can include the ePBT 3u spacebars in the timestamp, as well as a 1u R4 Delete key, 2u R4 blanks for left shift. (I might have a couple of other suitable blanks as well like R2 1.5u backspace, let me know if you're interested and I'll rummage.) I'll also include some shorter Costar inserts, as the stock ones can be a fraction too long to fit in shorter keycaps. 

2) Cherry G80-8000LUVGB (ISO-UK layout) [in it's original packaging](https://i.imgur.com/4iRf5HL.jpg). I've only taken it out to check that it's working and to do a [sound test.](https://i.imgur.com/QOLBxLv.mp4) It's dated 2019 and has retooled MX blacks which feel quite smooth. It's PCB mount so if you want you can lube them without desoldering. There's [no wear on the lasered keycaps.](https://i.imgur.com/cNOYzOm.jpg)  
  
3) Finally got a dark set with UK-ISO support so I'm letting this go. Light use, faint shine on a few keys. Ships in original trays.  
  
4) Couldn't get used to the XDA profile. Kits are Supernova alphas + Apollo mods + ISO enters. Ideally I'd like to trade for MT3 godspeed solar alphas + UK ISO + paypal, but will also consider a larger bundle (as long as it contains those two kits).   

Prices include paypal fees but not shipping*. Also feel free to offer me trades, especially for interesting kits or keycap sets!  
  
(*Shipping is roughly £5 in the UK, for elsewhere PM me and I'll look it up.) Thanks for looking!"

Selling my TX108SE today as I don't use it anymore. Price reflects what I have invested into it. Comes with a separate removeable shelf liner cut to fit the case below the PCB.

\- Unbuilt, 1 PCB desoldered using FR301. All keys and lights tested working. Please check the album :)

\- Brushed brass plate.

\- Flawless finish. No defects on the aluminium or brass parts anywhere.

\- LED diffuser between top and bottom which takes advantage of the underglow on the PCB. Lights under the TX logo.

\- PCB is completely programmable using SUO software that usually comes with all TX PCBs.

\- Comes with a large TX bag and all the included accessories. I'll NOT be shipping without the bag as this board is very heavy and I don't trust it to not get damaged during shipping without the bag.

I've tried to price this as fairly as possible. But if it seems crazy high to you, please let me know.

First, quick disclaimer: my phone suicided the other day (mid text; super convenient), and the camera on my tablet is apparently hot garbage.

Good afternoon Mechmarket,

I am selling a lightly used GMK Oblivion V2 Assembly Base Kit which was mounted on my Prime_E for two or three months before being swapped out for another set and sitting in the tray in my desk ever since. This kit covers ErgoDox, Atreus, Planck, Preonic, Boardwalk, Percebe, and various 40% keyboards. There is little to no shine on this set with the exception of the homerow keys which have a little shine to them. I counted 121 pieces as described on the sticker for the set and you should find every key accounted for on the timestamp provided.

I am asking $200 shipped in a ziploc, +$20 if you want it shipped in the tray. Thank you for reading.

1. there's a slight mark on the edge of the bottom right corner of the keyboard
2. the brass plate some blemishes (small black specs, areas that look like water marks, small scratches from switch puller). It doesn't show with keycaps on though.
3. the anodiziation isn't perfect on the bottom piece, a few small, faint black marks. However I have replacement one that I will include. I just never switched it out because it was on the bottom and didn't show."

**Please read full description of board before messaging : )**

Hi Mechmarket!

I have a space65 built with yok holy pandas lubed w/ 205g0 and durock stabs, alu plate and black badge. The board is in great condition despite one (albeit quite large) flaw, when building the board I believe I lifted the pads on both my up and down arrow key as well as backslash so they do not work. I believe this is fixable but with my current skills and tools available I do not believe I am able to do so, so I would prefer to let the board go to someone who doesn't mind the arrow keys or knows how to fix it : )

**Asking $850 Shipped Bundled w/ GMK Analog Dreams**

**630 Without the keycaps**

Not really looking to sell the keycaps separately unless I have a buyer for both but if you have to have it I'll let it go for $290 shipped (priced high to promote bundle)

Open to any offers as well as trades for boards of similar value, not really looking for anything in particular

Happy Wednesday everybody,

I have been very active on mechmarket for the past two months after years of not buying or selling and also not touching my keyboard collection. After a few of years of some things collecting dust and two months of fun switch and layout testing, it's time to let go and thin out my inventory. Most of these were just dumb, fun purchases to try out new things and now I feel bad just letting it sit. I've priced everything to sell (please correct me if something seems high though!) and also in the hopes of tempting people to drive out to pick it up. Everything listed was bought from this subreddit unless noted otherwise. Some of the boards listed have minor problems such as loose fit or non-functioning keys but all of them function with majority of keys working. More detailed explanations are at the bottom (and also to make it easier to read instead of stuffing it all in a table) and prices reflect any problems. *Again, I will only be responding to buyers local to Los Angeles.* Comment before PM, no chats -- no comment will be ignored, as will chat. Thanks, everyone. Stay safe, healthy, and have a good one!

More info on keyboards:

* **Tofu65**: Burgundy case, RGB/hotswap, mounted with H1s (205g0 lubed, 105 on springs, Kebo films), switches are PCB mounted but will include alu plate with purchase. Switches feel somewhat loose whether they are plate or PCB-mounted, so proceed with caution if you intend to use this as a switch tester. I couldn't get VIA to work on it and the backspace doesn't work, unsure if it's a socket issue.
* **Klippe T**: R3 in Ultramarine, DZ60 RGB ANSI V2, brass plate, case **and** plate foam, stabs are lubed. I couldn't get the H key and Windows key on either side to work. I disassembled the board, dusted/cleaned the case and PCB to remove any potential dust and still had this problem. QMK worked like a charm on everything though.
* **GK64**: Stabs were clipped, lubed, and band aid modded by previous owner, mounted with Alpacas (205g0 lubed, Kebo films).
* **Vortex Core**: Resoldered with Vintage Blacks (unsure what batch), left spacebar doesn't work but everything else does. Fun board but man, relearning the layers was tough.
* **POK3R**: Resoldered with 67g Zealios R4, did a bootleg band aid mod on *some* of the stabs, emphasis on some since the board is a solder. Done mostly for acoustics.
* **Realforce 87u**: 45g, stock. Was my daily driver for over a year but I'm back on mechanical switches for now.
* **Leopold FC660M**: Gray alu case, steel plate, stock MX Clears, cable from 90N1NE. This board means a lot to me, I bought it several years ago at one of the Long Beach r/mk meetups. The cable is a throwback as it's from before 90N1NE even had a website. Comes with black blank PBT caps pictured. Still works perfectly, will probably sound great if you lube the switches or put case foam.
* **Clueboard**: 2.1 version, green alu case, stock 65g Zealios R1 (!), cable from 90N1NE. PCB is soldered in a split right shift layout. This was a dumb purchase several years ago I never used yet never got rid of for some reason. Comes with black blank DSA caps pictured as well as leftover caps and switches (i.e. what didn't fit on the board). The V1 Zealios are funny compared to what they are now but they're not bad still.

Hello all, I am looking to raise funds to donate after my uncle passed away from Parkinson's. Just feel selfish with the boards. I have/have coming. Just looking to get back what I paid for the items to give funds to family and continue donating to research. Only looking to break even according to the prices posted. Willing to negotiate a little bit but prefer not to since this is going to a good cause. Spend time with loved ones, or at least give them a call regularly.

&#x200B;

I'll also be selling my Think6.5 Schrodinger, Gaff60 (only 60 made) and GMK Masterpiece, GMK Bento and GMK Hammerhead when they arrive in the future. Keep an eye out (obviously not for a while).

|Alphakey Keyporas|Pretty much most, but especially these colorways: **Alpha Centauri**, Inverse No Face, Trident, **Dystopia**, Shinobi, Batratoxin, Spawn.|
|:-|:-|
|FrumpzKeys|Spite helms and OG Runeclack V2, other red and black colorways, and Sephora Borealis|
|Alphakey Salvador|Mostly just Bombay atm (ask me for cat photo tax and you'll see why), but also interested in Deadpool and possibly others.|
|JAK Pollinator Birb|I loved this colorway even more than I thought. I am content, but if you happen to have a birb to trade, it would go great with my bowtie birb :).|

Paypal on either end of a trade is fine with me. Trades will also be invoiced in both directions.

Thanks for reading!

Levinson 40% ortholinear split keyboard: Built with Holy Pandas (made with YOK panda housings, halo true stems, 67g springs, lubed with 205g0). The build has the tenting holes available and a frosted acrylic middle layer so the RGB is diffused very nicely. It had a super small crack on a couple of the corners which I've fixed with super glue. I've included images but you might not even be able to tell where it was lol. Top layer is black acrylic, and the input type is Type-C. Overall a great board, just don't use it as much as I've taken to other layouts lately. Bundled as: Left Half & Right Half with holy pandas soldered and TRRS Cable

Switches: Kailh Box Pink    
Stabs: GMK screw-in clipped + lubed with Krytox 205g0    
Caps: DSA Scientific    
Artisan: B.O.B. Gengar

Built for my wife. She tried it for one day and said she prefers full layout and asked me to build her a full layout keyboard with box pinks....... -\_\_\_-

I was very intentional about the aesthetics of this build. Nothing was bought in the aftermarket, so ideally I would like to keep everything bundled together. Board is in flawless shape, I basically just took it out of the packaging, soldered everything, assembled it, did 1 typing test, gave it to my wife, and she gave it back an hour later and said too small.

DSA Scientific was bought in the original group buy but not used much (no shine at all). It includes the Alphas, TKL + Specialty, and ISO kits.

B.O.B. Gengar was from like round 2 or something, I don't remember.

Asking $500+ shipping. In light of Covid, I would really like to keep shipping to ConUS only. (SOLD!)

*edit  
I've been getting a lot of requests to part out. I'm getting people requesting different parts of this setup, so if I get buyers for all the components I'd be willing to oblige."

Hi everyone!

Today I have up for trade my GMK Jamon Base Kit with original box and trays.

The reason for trading is that it really clashes more with the wood of the Kayak than I was expecting :(

I’m looking for a set to trade it for GMK Camping r1 or 2 with novelties. R1 much more preferred than R2 but I can settle for r2. I don’t care if used or not, just looking for a nice set to use. Not looking to sell at this time.

Hello everyone, up for sale is my used GMK Laser sets which I bought when I was first getting into the hobby. I used it on my gaming keyboard and so if there is slight shine it's on the usual suspects (WASD and spacebar).  Selling this set to a loving home because I switched over to SA Laser.

Here's a close up of the WASD, as you can see there's practically no shine. [WASD Closeup](https://imgur.com/Rnn3AB0)

The keys were [mounted on 60%](https://imgur.com/g8LB40U) so here are the ones that were used, all of the rest have been in bags ever since.

I'd prefer to sell everything in one big bundle but am open to splitting it all up if there's interest.

Brown paper from the Acrylic wrapping is still in tact. Looking to sell it mainly because I couldn't get used to the 40% layout after trying it for a month, and hence, I have left this unbuilt.

Moving sale! Looking to get rid of a few items from my collection that I no longer need before I move.  Prices  listed below are including shipping to CONUS ONLY.

* KBD67MKI   (NOT MKII): $235 shipped. Comes with hotswap pcb (split backspace),   lubed zeal stabs, brass plate, alum plate, and dampening foam. It is   blue, with the brass weight in the back. Great condition, only flaw with   it is one of the back screws will not fully screw in. The case is  still  fully secured without it, and I am sure it can be fixed, I just  have  not had a use for it in a while.
* ~~Realforce   R2 Ivory 55g: $230 shipped. Carefully lubed with 205g0 on the sliders,   and has silence rings installed. Board sounds and feels amazing. SOLD~~
* ~~GMK Mitolet: $170 Shipped in bags. Has some shine, as these caps were used for roughly a month. SOLD~~
* SA Calm Depths: $145 shipped in bags. There is decent shine on these, as I used them for about 2 months or so.

Full disclosure:

1) the difference in color between the final product and the renders is well documented. Look up pictures. In my opinion, the set in person under normal lighting conditions looks closer to the renders than a few of the pics floating around that are taken literally in direct sunlight are suggesting. Unless you are planning on typing outside in the sun with this set, it won't look like that. That being said, look at all available pics first so you can make a decision.



2) looking to sell them as a set. Please do not offer to buy one or the other.



3) after tax, my price from drop came out to $229.52. Looking for $300 including shipping. Yes, I would like to try and make a few bux on it. Times are tough.



4) this is a super long shot but I would also trade straight up for sealed GMK Yuri.

Hey guys! I'm trying to sell some things that deserve a better home.

I bought the Realforce R2 PFU TKL earlier this year and discovered that Topre is just not my thing. It's the PFU version that has uniform 45g domes, silenced purple sliders, and is able to control the volume and actuation point.

It's in excellent condition -- I opened it once to lightly lube the spacebar stabilizer (could use some more now). This keyboard comes with the original box and accessories: manuals, keycap puller, extra keycaps, and both dampening pads.

GMK Oblivion V2 is BNIB sealed and comes with the fixed keys."

If you need more pictures of anything below, please let me know.

**The Valve Index is up for trade and possible trade+PayPal depending on the offer.**

First, the keyboard stuff :) 

**GMK Space Cadet** - $225 ; Base set

~~**SA Blood/Shadow (Red/Black)** - $240 ; A seriously sexy keyset (a nice dark red) but I'm just not a fan of SA anymore. Here is a picture of what the keyset looks like laid out on a board [SA Blood Shadow](https://imgur.com/a/OxvN7vZ)~~ SOLD for asking

~~**Black KBD75** - $300 ; Recently purchased from mm but just not a huge fan of Blueberries. Not my style. It's built with a brass plate, lubed cherry screw-in stabs, lubed NK Blueberries~~ SOLD for asking

~~**60% Burgundy Tofu with a brass plate** - $90 ; A little scuffed because of a recent move from state to state. Comes with case foam, no PCB. [Pictures of some scuffage](https://imgur.com/a/AZXmXjl)~~ SOLD for asking

**CM Storm Novatouch** - $150 ; Bought this board for work but I've got some others I use instead now. Has KBDfans MX sliders so you can pop your MX keysets on it!

**And now the big boy**

I have a very new Valve Index kit. I had finally received it about 2 months ago. I'm selling/trading this because I was a very early purchaser of the HTC Vive and really loved it for some time. I grew from it and had stopped VRing as much. I thought buying a newly upgraded kit would do the same but unfortunately I didn't last very long with this new kit and found myself sticking to flatscreen gaming. Being that the wait time for this kit is over 2 months, I thought maybe someone else would enjoy it instead of this beauty collecting dust. It's an absolute phenomenal experience and is just perfect for someone who may like VR more than me.  **This does NOT come wit Half-Life Alyx and does NOT come with the Base Station camera stands that I bought separately and can be seen at the bottom of the timestamp. They were purchased online so I didn't have to screw holes into my apartment walls. I can include these for a cost.**

I will be willing to trade it for a high end board. Or a pristine board + PayPal. I'm mostly into TKL or 75% and have a preference of black or red boards.

Thank you and have a great day!"

Got to make room for future projects, so letting go of a couple of things today.  
1) Filco Minila Air - £55  
2) Cherry G80-8000 - £65  
3) SA WoB (Maxkey) - £75  
4) XDA Godspeed - MT3 godspeed

Description:  
1) Thought this one would be a fixer-upper but after I gave it a cleanup it was pretty nice! Probably the most solid stock keeb I've tried. As you may expect, the browns aren't the most tactile, but they actually feel pretty smooth and sound quite nice. Here are some sound tests: [with OEM keycaps](https://i.imgur.com/XTEXgUn.mp4) [with GMK keycaps](https://i.imgur.com/gqNuYLp.mp4) [with PBT XDA profile keycaps](https://i.imgur.com/QdDJlqG.mp4).  
There are [DIP switches](https://deskthority.net/wiki/File:Filco_Minila_backplate_1.jpeg) at the back so you can change a few things about the layout. Sadly I only have the OEM keycaps for the layout in the picture.  
I know layout compatibility can be a real issue with Minilas, so if you're planning to use it with Cherry profile keycaps I can include the ePBT 3u spacebars in the timestamp, as well as a 1u R4 Delete key, 2u R4 blanks for left shift. (I might have a couple of other suitable blanks as well like R2 1.5u backspace, let me know if you're interested and I'll rummage.) I'll also include some shorter Costar inserts, as the stock ones can be a fraction too long to fit in shorter keycaps. 

2) Cherry G80-8000LUVGB (ISO-UK layout) [in it's original packaging](https://i.imgur.com/4iRf5HL.jpg). I've only taken it out to check that it's working and to do a [sound test.](https://i.imgur.com/QOLBxLv.mp4) It's dated 2019 and has retooled MX blacks which feel quite smooth. It's PCB mount so if you want you can lube them without desoldering. There's [no wear on the lasered keycaps.](https://i.imgur.com/cNOYzOm.jpg)  
  
3) Finally got a dark set with UK-ISO support so I'm letting this go. Light use, faint shine on a few keys. Ships in original trays.  
  
4) Couldn't get used to the XDA profile. Kits are Supernova alphas + Apollo mods + ISO enters. Ideally I'd like to trade for MT3 godspeed solar alphas + UK ISO + paypal, but will also consider a larger bundle (as long as it contains those two kits).   

Prices include paypal fees but not shipping*. Also feel free to offer me trades, especially for interesting kits or keycap sets!  
  
(*Shipping is roughly £5 in the UK, for elsewhere PM me and I'll look it up.) Thanks for looking!"

Hey r/mm, have some items looking to part with:

Keyboards: 


Item | Price | Description
---|----|----
~~Austere~~| ~~$700 shipped~~ SOLD for $650 + shipping | ~~Black color with Aluminum Plate, and FR4 plate. Great sounding board, and only 20 of these were made. I did not end up liking the bigger bezels that it has. Otherwise loved it. PCB is TGR Alice PCB that has been desoldered twice with an Hakko FR301. Also is compatible with Project Keyboard Alice PCB if you have one of those (USB Mini version that is.)~~
~~NK65 v2 Aluminum (Black)~~ | ~~$225 shipped~~ SOLD for asking | ~~Got this to be a hotswap tester board, and have ended up only using one set of switches in it, and then haven't touched it since. Stabs are lubed with 205g0 on the housing, and then wire is with dielectric. Wire has been swapped to Durock gold wires. Has one layer of box liner in addition to the silicon sheet in the bottom for noise dampening. Note there will be a restock of this board soon in E-White, and then Novelkeys will be holding a Unlimited GB for the Milkshake edition with Blip. However, this is Black which has no current noted restock time.~~ 

Keycaps:

Item | Price | Description
---|----|----
~~GMK Pulse Bundle (Base set, Arabic alphas, and Micons)~~ | ~~$385 shipped~~ SOLD all | ~~This is a ton of keys for Pulse and why I'm looking to bundle it all. Will be as follows: Base set that does have a good amount shine as it got used heavily by me when I first got it $155 + Arabic Alphas I did not use besides mounting one time and typing for about 30 mins $100 + and lastly the Pulse Micons that I used in addition to the Arabic Alphas for a short time $130. So all together for $385. I may possibly be willing to separate the kits, and sell them separately. Shoot me a question regarding this and we can go from there.~~

Miscellaneous (Case/PCB/Plate):


Item | Price | Description
---|---|----
5 Degree Case | $70 shipped | Black color, and only used once as made a quick and cheap build for it, but didn't end up doing so
~~DZ60 Rev 2~~ |~~$35 shipped~~ SOLD! | ~~This has been desoldered twice with a Hakko FR301, and tested for full functionality. Will also include a PC half plate i had intended to use with it, but never did from KBD Fans.~~ 
~~5 degree w/ DZ60 bundle~~ |~~$95 shipped~~ Bundle now void since I sold the PCB | ~~Will take $5 off both items and sell them as bundle with the included PC plate.~~ 
 
With this would like to keep it to CONUS only, but will also consider a US Proxy if that is listed as your PayPal address only. Please drop a comment before PM, and no chat please! I will not see it. As well thanks for stopping, and taking a look. Thanks everyone!"

[Order Form](https://forms.gle/FZu6U1m9fkQtEWS37)

More details/FAQ/photos are on the order form so that this post doesnt end up being 5 pages long. Please read there. Any questions, please join the discord server for fastest reply.

If you miss this round and want to get the heads up on the next one, please fill out the [Notification Form](https://forms.gle/m5HEEXna7yMRCWdX6).

Timeline:

\-Form open: Now until 8pm Monday Sept 7th, unless demand is obviously greater than what I can cut for

\-Invoices will go out between form close and 10pm EST, Sept 8th.

\-Shipping no later than Friday Sept 11 - usually your stuff will ship in <24 hours from when you pay your invoice

If you are unwilling/unable to make this timeframe, please do not order.

Note: For the Mysterium and Discipline PLATE foam, these are now using 3mm to allow for flexier builds given the FR4 plate that is typically used on these builds. Case foam remains 6mm.

Sorry, one final thing. Because of the new [r/mm](https://www.reddit.com/r/mm/) rules on bulk selling, I CANNOT confirm trades for rep for foam stuff. Mods kindly clarified for me and I WILL follow the rules.

Update 4:45pm EST Sept 7th 
Closing the form early.  All but two invoices already sent out.  The two that haven't been, there's some flaw in your order or address, so I've sent you a message to confirm.  If you were expecting an invoice and didn't receive one, means the form didn't capture for some reason, please shoot me a PM.

2.	~~Cannonkeys Savage65 Black Anodized | [Sound Check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPCelPqPsgw) | This board needs no introduction. 65% from Cannonkeys’ Brutalist line. Built with C3 Tangerines 67g lubed with 205g0 and transparent purple Durock stabs. In contrast to other Savages, somehow, this one sounds damn amazing. It’s the same PCB, same FR4 plate, same aluminum chassis, same polyfill, but this one has an almost gasket-like sound quality to it. Have yourself a [listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPCelPqPsgw) and tell me what you think. Flawless condition. Comes with spare 7U FR4 plate, allen wrench, and extra O-rings for the burger mount. No keycaps included. Asking for $580 shipped~~ **SOLD for $550 locally shipped**

It has been a bit since I've done a selling post and I'm here with something a little different.

[Keyboard Timestamp](https://imgur.com/rLGPeDM)

[Valve Index Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/rhoVBgD)

If you need more pictures of anything below, please let me know.

**The Valve Index is up for trade and possible trade+PayPal depending on the offer.**

First, the keyboard stuff :) 

**GMK Space Cadet** - $225 ; Base set

**SA Round 6 (Red/Black)** - $200 ; A seriously sexy keyset (a nice dark red) but I'm just not a fan of SA anymore. Here is a picture of what the keyset looks like laid out on a board [SA Round 6](https://imgur.com/a/OxvN7vZ) 

**Black KBD75** - $300 ; Recently purchased from mm but just not a huge fan of Blueberries. Not my style. It's built with a brass plate, lubed cherry screw-in stabs, lubed NK Blueberries

**60% Burgundy Tofu with a brass plate** - $90 ; A little scuffed because of a recent move from state to state. Comes with case foam, no PCB. [Pictures of some scuffage](https://imgur.com/a/AZXmXjl)

**CM Storm Novatouch** - $150 ; Bought this board for work but I've got some others I use instead now. Has KBDfans MX sliders so you can pop your MX keysets on it!

**And now the big boy**

I have a very new Valve Index kit. I had finally received it about 2 months ago. I'm selling/trading this because I was a very early purchaser of the HTC Vive and really loved it for some time. I grew from it and had stopped VRing as much. I thought buying a newly upgraded kit would do the same but unfortunately I didn't last very long with this new kit and found myself sticking to flatscreen gaming. Being that the wait time for this kit is over 2 months, I thought maybe someone else would enjoy it instead of this beauty collecting dust. It's an absolute phenomenal experience and is just perfect for someone who may like VR more than me.  **This does NOT come wit Half-Life Alyx and does NOT come with the Base Station camera stands that I bought separately and can be seen at the bottom of the timestamp. They were purchased online so I didn't have to screw holes into my apartment walls. I can include these for a cost.**

I will be willing to trade it for a high end board. Or a pristine board + PayPal. I'm mostly into TKL or 75% and have a preference of black or red boards.

Thank you and have a great day!"

~~**[E-White Klippe T R4](https://i.imgur.com/DWdpAqE.jpg)**~~

Bought from 1up (@ $165) and used for about a day. Removable standoffs are great for sound and flex but I'm not too into tray mounts anymore, even at Mekanisk's quality. Plus I've joined too many GBs recently...

Flawless condition, will ship in Mekanisk's original packaging. I forgot to picture it, but it will come with the case screws and removable standoffs.

I can also optionally add on [stupidfish1's dz60 ansi plate foam](https://i.imgur.com/v2KMB1j.jpg) and some [""case foam"" I cut](https://i.imgur.com/TzO8nIl.jpg) for **+$10**. Please lmk in pm if you are interested.

Asking: ~~**$170 shipped**~~ **sold**

&nbsp;

~~**[E-White Tofu 60%](https://i.imgur.com/tDA36sg.jpg)**~~

Very good condition aside from a few defects on the back (**see: [1](https://i.imgur.com/w9QTueV.jpg) || [2](https://i.imgur.com/SptWAtZ.jpg) || [3](https://i.imgur.com/MVufZRW.jpg) || [4](https://i.imgur.com/E2CVtZR.jpg))**. I forgot to picture it, but it will come with the case screws.

~~I can also optionally add on a set of [stupidfish1's tofu case and ANSI plate foam](https://i.imgur.com/brMlVOo.jpg) for **+$20**. Please lmk in pm if you are interested.~~

Asking: ~~**$108 + shipping**~~ **sold**

&nbsp;

~~**[60% Brass Plate (2.25u left shift)](https://i.imgur.com/MxRH5mW.jpg)**~~

From KBDfans, 2.25u left shift layout. Used a few times with a hot-swap PCB, there are a few scratches where switches have been pulled out that I've tried to picture as best as I could (see album). Otherwise in good condition.

Asking: ~~**$35 + shipping**~~ e: not avail anymore

&nbsp;

~~**[Fake Sushi PBT](https://i.imgur.com/ulPdfMH.jpg)**~~

Used for a few days (keys for 60% and numpad). Some wear/smoothness on the right side of the spacebar where I hit it, but no shine on any other keys.

Thick PBT, dye-subbed, Cherry profile. *This only has 6.25u space layout*. If you are more curious about other misc. info about these keys, [please check the caption in the imgur album](https://imgur.com/ulPdfMH).

Tray is for display only - these caps will be shipped in a bag.

Asking: ~~**$35 + shipping OBO**~~ **sold**

~~**[100x Re-Tooled Cherry Blacks (Lubed and Filmed)](https://i.imgur.com/Dg4jMrj.jpg)**~~

* housing & stem lubed with 205g0
* springs lubed with [hbheroinbob's krytox blend #3](https://www.reddit.com/user/hbheroinbob/comments/edlx0q/about_lubing_and_assembly_linears_and_tactiles/)
* filmed with black TX films (the old ones that had the bar in the middle)

Typed on for about a week on a hotswap board.

Lubing process is [pretty much this](https://imgur.com/a/U3qCbh9) but donut-dipping springs instead of oiling, as well as adding films.

Bought from NK_, so 5-pin. Smooth feel and deep, thocky sound.

Asking: ~~**$100 shipped**~~ edit: nvm, these are priced way too much. I'll be keeping these instead...

&nbsp;

~~**[Blue Bento Deskmat](https://i.imgur.com/VZwyK0V.jpg)**~~

I think I had it on my desk for a day. Otherwise it's been in its sleeve on my shelf. Very good condition.

Bento GB ended a few days ago. NK_ should have extra bento deskmats in a few months if you can wait.

Asking: ~~**$60 shipped**~~ **sold**

&nbsp;

~~**[Zambumon Hexagon Dark Deskmat](https://i.imgur.com/peH53RI.jpg)**~~

Unused, new condition.

Disclaimer: Serika 2 is happening sometime later this year and the hexagon deskmats (blue, red, light, & dark) will return with it, so if you can wait, I suggest waiting for that.

Asking: ~~**$60 shipped**~~ edit: nvm

Built for my wife. She tried it for one day and said she prefers full layout and asked me to build her a full layout keyboard with box pinks....... -\_\_\_-

I was very intentional about the aesthetics of this build. Nothing was bought in the aftermarket, so ideally I would like to keep everything bundled together. Board is in flawless shape, I basically just took it out of the packaging, soldered everything, assembled it, did 1 typing test, gave it to my wife, and she gave it back an hour later and said too small.

DSA Scientific was bought in the original group buy but not used much. It includes the Alphas, TKL + Specialty, and ISO kits.

B.O.B. Gengar was from like round 2 or something, I don't remember.

Asking $500+ shipping. In light of Covid, I would really like to keep shipping to ConUS only."

|[NOS Torch keyboard](https://imgur.com/gallery/YNHktft) (Green Alps)|This is a new old-stock keyboard for a [Torch Triple X](http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/3123/Torch-Triple-X-with-Monitor-Keyboard-and-Mouse/) system launched in 1985, it features SKCL Green Alps linear switches in new, very smooth condition. There is a dent in the bottom of the chassis but otherwise the board is in immaculate condition. Don't ask me about protocols, I haven't bothered to make a converter for the connector, it's probably XT or AT. This board is actually very sturdy and heavier than it looks, but I'll understand if you're just buying it as a donor ;)|£175+shipping|
|SKCM Cream Alps switches x52 (Undampened)|Harvested from a Canon AP360 typewriter, not to be confused with the shitty dampened kind, these guys are the real deal, nicest alps tactiles. OK condition, not perfect but I haven't bothered to clean and lube them myself, I'll leave that to you. I would use them myself but I'm hopping off the alps wagon for now (Comes with a bonus 15x green alps switches harvested from the same typewriter)|£70+shipping|
|[WEY Modular Keyboard HK2000C](https://imgur.com/gallery/P0sshQe)|Big industrial board made by GMK for Weytec, afaik these were quite pricey boards in their day. Board is used condition with a good few scuffs on its chassis but no significant damage, caps are mostly shined, with some minor damage to the Enter and both shift keys (see imgur album). You'll need to source yourself the specific powered KVM unit if you want to use this board, which I can maybe help you track down. GMK caps, stock MX Clears.|~~£150+shipping~~ SOLD|
|[Apple Mac Portable numpad unit (?)](https://imgur.com/gallery/BuTbG9C) (Orange Alps)|I'm assuming this is a numpad unit for a Mac Portable, which usually came with trackball units instead. Comes with SKCM Orange Alps and apple pbt dyesub caps both in great condition and likely never used.|~~£20+shipping~~ SOLD|
|[Siemens Unity 2 keyboard](https://imgur.com/a/QaPqEss)|75%-ish board made by GMK for Siemens' Unity 2 hearing aid calibration systems. This board is fully usable with NKRO over ps/2 or usb, you'll need either a male-to-male ps/2 or male-to-male usb2 typeA, it actually feels and sounds fantastic imo, I used one of them for months myself. As you can see from the pictures the chassis has taken quite a few scratches and scuffs and could do with a new paint job, and the caps are fairly shined. GMK caps, stock MX Blacks.

Hello and thanks for stopping by,

I have a Discipline65v2 that I finished building just last night. This kit has StupidFish Foams between the bottom and PCB as well as plate foam between the PCB and plate. This was built with lubed Gat Milky Yellows. Lube used was GPL 105 in springs and 205g0 on the stems and housings. Very smooth. This has a 7U bottom row spacebar and stepped Caps. If the stepped Caps isn’t your still, something could be done for that. I used GMK screw in stabilizers all lubed with 205g0 with dielectric grease on the wires. Caps are ePBT ABS WoB. Brand New. Zero Shine

Edit: **Discipline Still Available**

Asking $185 shipped for Discipline65v2 w/o caps.

Asking $280 shipped for Discipline65v2 w/ caps.

* GMK Mitolet: $180 Shipped in bags. Has some shine, as these caps were used for roughly a month.

|:-|:-|
|FrumpzKeys|Spite helms and OG Runeclack V2|
|Alphakey Salvador|Mostly just Bombay atm (ask me for cat photo tax and you'll see why), but also interested in Kaonashi and Deadpool.|
|JAK Pollinator Birb|I loved this colorway even more than I thought. I am content, but if you happen to have a birb to trade, it would go great with my bowtie birb :).|

Paypal on either end of a trade is fine with me. Trades will also be invoiced in both directions.

Hey MM!

Today for sale I have some tangies and some doubleshot PBT keycaps in the  WoB colorway. These come from the same molds and manufacturer as the widely popular NovelKeys BoW and Vaporwave. These are excellent, thick, doubleshot PBT keycaps that have really nice, crisp legends. They also feature [0 warp](https://imgur.com/a/MXUFvRP), unlike a certain GMK WoB keyset. The WoB have the following compatibility, and will include all caps and the keycap puller shown in this pic: [https://imgur.com/a/yNOpYmT](https://imgur.com/a/yNOpYmT)

This includes 1.75u rshift, 7u, 6u, 2.25 and 2.75u spacebars, 1u mods, 1.5u mods, 1.25u mods, and 65% keys. should fit most boards.

Note: These are not keycaps from Novelkeys, but are from the same molds and same factory and are the same quality.

848,/r/mechmarket/comments/ikt0e3/usdch_gmk_blue_alert_base_kit_w_good_vibes/,1598994666.0,[US-DC][H] GMK Blue Alert Base Kit [W] Good Vibes,"Hello everyone! I am helping my friend give away a new, unused set of GMK Blue Alert!

&#x200B;

Winner has been drawn and contacted! Will draw this tomorrow afternoon if I haven't heard back from them. Thank you everyone for your comments, I enjoyed reading as many as I could. Everyone has something to be thankful for and thank y'all for taking the time to remember that!

&#x200B;

[Free-stamp is best-stamp](https://imgur.com/a/aSgcZQg)

&#x200B;

Some  backstory: Last year I convinced my friend who was already into  mechanical keyboards to buy his first GMK set. He decided to go with  Blue Alert and purchased the last in-stock set from Originative's  website. A couple weeks later, he got his notification that it had been  delivered, but there was no package to be found. He reached out to  Originative about his situation and after looking into it on their end,  it was determined that the package was stolen and so they offered to  send a replacement. However, there were no more sets of Blue Alert left  in stock, so my friend opted for a set of True Olivetti (which he  greatly enjoys!). Fast forward half a year to now and a surprise  package from Originative arrived at his door. Inside he found a brand  new set of Blue Alert! Being content with his current board and True Olivetti, he decided to pass on the good vibes and sponsor this  giveaway!

&#x200B;

How to enter: Comment on this post  with a number 0-10000, what board you plan to put this keyset on if you  win, and something that has kept you going or happy over the past 6  months!

&#x200B;

Bonus: Show Originative some love for great customer service and going out of the way to try and make things right!

&#x200B;

The  winner will be picked via RNG in 72 hours. Shipping covered for CONUS,  otherwise will invoice the winner (sorry rest of the world :/)

&#x200B;

This  giveaway is intended to give someone who hasn't tried (or can't afford)  a GMK set the chance to experience it, let someone add a classic set to  their collection, and generate some general good vibes for everyone.

&#x200B;

It  should go without saying, but this is NOT so the winner can cop an easy  flip. While I can't stop anyone from doing as they please, know that  doing so is contrary to the spirit of this giveaway and is taking  advantage of the communal generosity and comradery that has made this  community what it is. Also I will consider you a meany mc'jerkface from  here on out.

&#x200B;

Good luck everyone!"

The typical timeframe is 1-2 weeks, including domestic shipping to the proxy, their processing time in HK (3 days usually) and time that cargos waiting for pick-up at bay. It is pretty reliable since COVID-19. [Here's some DHL tracking after they pick up the package.](https://imgur.com/a/czxgagT)

Timestamp: [https://imgur.com/a/SCGksaU](https://imgur.com/a/SCGksaU)

This is a green KBD8X MkII built with lubed Tangerines R2 and GMK Boba Fett by Taeha Types. Here's his build video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gqWv2BpEPI&t=9018s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gqWv2BpEPI&t=9018s)

I've added the kbdfans 8x mkII dampening foam, so the board sounds slightly lower pitched than it does in Taeha's typing test. I personally really like how this board looks and sounds with the foam, but I've got another build in the works and am trying to funnel some of my keyboard stuff into audio equipment. I'm of course also including the rest of the GMK Boba Fett set with this, all of the caps not shown in the timestamp are completely unused.

I've been using this as my primary keyboard since it was built, so there's some shine on the keycaps that should be visible in the timestamp. Otherwise, the 8X itself looks the same as it did when it was built, which does include some minor streaking in the anodization on one side and a very subtle dark spot towards the lower right of the top piece. These should be visible in the build video.

I'm looking to get ~~$700~~ $650 shipped to the US, though I'd consider other offers. Thanks!

Edit: Closed. I've decided to keep the board. "
