Hello Mechmarket,

&#x200B;

I am looking to sell my built Discipline65 and Discipad.

It comes with T1s lubed with 3204 and switch films.

The Discipline was built with C3 stabs and the Discipad with GMK screw in stabs, lubed with 205g0.

One of the C3 stabs has a little egde broken off, doesn´t affect it in any way and the remaining stabs come with the kit. It´s shown in the Album.

It currently has a 7U bottom row, the 6.25 wire is included for you to switch it though.

The Acrylic has a few tiny scratches, nothing major and not even visible on pictures. For pictures of it with caps on look at my latest posts.

&#x200B;

What you get:

    Discipline65, Discipad, all in all 90x T1´s lubed with films, remaining C3 stabs, extra screws/standoffs.

Price:

    SOLD

This i what the parts are worth, not factoring in lube, films, time and GMK stabs.

&#x200B;

Notes:

I need 2 to 3 days to get it shipped, keep that in mind please. I am posting this today because that way i have more time to answer questions and so on.

I can´t go any lower with the price, so i can´t accept any offers unfortunately.

I might have 3 built kits without switches and stabs in the coming weeks, so if you are more interested in these wait for them. No ETA though and might or might not happen.

Please comment before PM and please don´t use the chat, it gets buggy for me sometimes and then people hate me because i don´t answer their messages xD

Thank you for taking a look!

~~I am now leaning more towards the possibility of selling this -- my WPM is a bit lower on this because I can't comfortably cross over for my left hand to reach Y, and also -_ is further which personally isn't ideal for coding:(. Mainly looking for trades however — nothing particular in mind, however I would be likely on trading for a wonderland pcb + cash. Right now I am on the fence about selling so that is why my price is a little high. It will come down eventually.~~

~~**Here are build details:**~~

- ~~Clear Lubrigante case (good condition and only a few days old, though note that the clear acrylic is insanely prone to scratches so I have no guarantees on that. Also putting it together without small bits of dust / markings in the layers is super hard unless I have a dust-free environment, which I do not). So there may be some signs of dust as well.~~
- ~~Black Wonderland PCB (USB-C)~~
- ~~Mauve Sky Switches (mauve bottoms, mauve stems, mauve springs, Outemu Clear no-slot tops) lubed with 205g0 — no films needed / possible due to very high tolerance of Outemu tops. Had stock mauves, didn’t like the way they sounded, built these and sold the rest of my stock mauves. Outemu no-slot tops eliminate all stem wobble COMPLETELY, in addition to making the sound much deeper ([small example, not worth much but noticeable diff](https://i.imgur.com/verGOOz.mp4)). I can include the stock Mauve tops.~~
- ~~Everglide / Durock stabilizers. 2u Gray Everglide stabs on the two spacebars, 2u Purple Durock stabs on the enter / left shift. Lubed with 205g0 and dielectric grease, bandaid modded.~~

&nbsp;


~~[**JTK Aqua Alphas / accents - $25**](https://i.imgur.com/GDMt6T9.jpg)~~
-

~~Comes with the keys you see ( that aren't the GMK metropolis spacebars :P). For $25, you can have an alternative alpha set to swap in if you have some mods to go with em. That being said, getting these has definitely made me open to buying more JTK in the future -- **the legends are super sharp, even sharper / crisper than my GMK set.** See the pics for example. There is a scratch on the B key. You get the 7u white spacebar, as well as 7u / 6.25u teal spacebar. TBH, it might even be a nice buy if you have a monochrome kit and want to just use the teal ESC / ENTER accents!~~

~~[**GMK Metropolis Spacebars - $25**](https://i.imgur.com/FqKEuXK.jpg)~~

~~Metropolis spacebars. Used the mint 7u for a few minutes, as well as the 2.75u. Others unused.~~

**Norbaforce:** [Album](https://imgur.com/a/rPcy37r#gcjVJc7) I really enjoyed the top mount topre experience, but the front height of the board is too much for my wrists. Case is almost in perfect condition, only defects being a very thin white streak on the bottom right of the case, and some marks on the aluminum backplate and around the screw holes. **Looking for $320 shipped**

**Realforce:** [Album](https://imgur.com/a/T6zqZY7#1UeqJsi) The 10th Anniversary Edition. Has the grey-blue color scheme with a dark navy blue case. Has BKE ultralights and lights installed (see album for configuration). ***Does not include stock domes.*** Slider rails are lubed with mechlube 2 and the stabs have been greased to reduce rattle. The previous owner stripped a screw of its head and messed up the screw heads of 2 others. Got some replacements from McMaster and put them in, and while the screw head is a bit smaller, they still work fine. The missing screw does not affect keyfeel or operation at all. Will include 10 additional screws, as well as the included keycaps (ctrl-caps swap, red esc, blue wasd cluster) **Looking for $195 shipped**

**GMK Oblivion Cadet:** Used for less than an hour **45 shipped**

~~**Fujitsu:** [Album](https://imgur.com/a/h98BrLn#je44eB7) Has the rare varient of 3rd gen fujitsu leaf spring, that being the clicky version. All in a Tandy 3000, which can easily be converted for use on modern systems. Cleaned the case, keycaps, plate, and the innards, though a lot of scratches and marks still remain on the case. Unsure if there's any binding. Only case I've found is the 'T' key, but pressing the key in the exact same position doesn't lead to any binding. Otherwise keyfeel is still fine, even for the well-used alpha block to which the keycaps have shine to them. **Looking for $110 shipped CONUS**~~ **SOLD**

Just not getting enough love for the moment. Figured someone else might like it, so here it is. 

Last chance for this one. 

Built by /u/LightningXI, has lubed vintage MX Blacks with 58.5g springs, they were aftermarket purchases so I'm not 100% sure on the lube used but they feel perfect. No scuffs on the board itself, handled with care so except for the stray markings on the polycarb because thats the nature of polycarb. [Only slight markings on the weight, nothing crazy they look very shallow.](https://i.imgur.com/DCSSQXp.jpg) 

Only comes with the board + the extra pcbs/plates, no keycaps. 

* GMK Modern Dolch - ~~$400? idk, super OBO~~ pending

Used for about a week, cemented that I don't like how abs feels or how it gets shiny kinda fast especially with how much i use my WASD and such. 

All kits included, shipped in bag unless requested otherwise.

* Sticky Grape Mulder - $60
* ADAMSKI ""Starcluster"" Gamer - $220

* Tokkipee ??? Gamer - $30

[These are the Tokkipee gamers, sorry for bad lighting in timestamp, can't do much about required lights in apartment complex.](https://i.imgur.com/5QxCzNn.png) They come with Esc, WASD and an Fn. 

ADAMSKI Gamer doesn't have a name, but they look *very* similar to Bro's Starcluster/Starclusterfuck colorway so that's what I'm calling them. Comes with Esc, WASD and two Fns. These are Cherry profile, but they sit high on switches, its not an OEM profile because the angles match, they probably were prototypes of some sort.

 - ~~NK65 - Honestly just not a fan of the layout and there are some upcoming boards I am much more interested in. Will come with 205g0 lubed black inks (There is one red ink for the escape key because I ran out of black inks). All switches have been filmed and spring swapped to 65 gram TX springs. There are a couple nicks along the top and bottom bezels from trying to take out the switches without a good switch puller, but they are barely noticeable, especially with caps installed. I bought a rama puller to help take the switches out easier and this will be included as well. Stabs have been lubed with 205g0 and have everglide wires and clear stab inserts because the stock cherry ones just felt off no matter what I did to them. -> Looking for $250 shipped and insured.~~ Sold.

Sadly it's time i sell my precious TGR Alice. Bought back in (August?) 2018 when the B-stock kits were available. Also included a Purple Heartwood wrist rest from Aeryxz's group buy. 


See album for full details
Condition of the board is pretty good; It's been barely used this last year; stored in the packaging it was shipped in. But the brass plate, not so much its tarnishing pretty badly and I dont have the facility to clean it up anymore (see photos).

Switches are Tangerines (62g iirc).





It's hard to get a gauge on the value of these right now; I price-checked but got no answers. Therefore list price is ~~$2400 OBO+shipping~~. **SOLD**

Not FCFS. Will prioritize any buyer in Japan, especially if they can meet in person in Tokyo. Obviously prefer JPY instead of USD in this case.


I'll also throw in the pictured GMK Lazer keys and cable pictured for free (unless not wanted) since I would no longer have use for them.","[JP] [H] TGR Alice B-stock Pink+wrist rest [W] PayPal, Cash"

Hello All,

As the description states I have some items for sale.  I purchased everything within the last 3 months.  It has seen little to no use.

The price is shipped to CONUS only.  Will not be shipping outside US at the moment.  Not FCFS.  I will be out of town this weekend with my sons basketball team.  All items will ship USPS on 3/2

**TOFU 60% Aluminum Purple Case**

**~~Nano Bento by Keebwerk~~**

*Asking $190 (sold for $180)*

This is an incredible, chonky little USB-C QMK-enabled macropad with programmable MIDI slider. It comes with Cherry browns, but IS hot-swappable. I clipped+lubed the stab under the 2u key. Please note it will ship with its original packaging, but no USB-C cable is included.

With the exception of a small scuff beneath the slider (see pictures), it's in very good condition. The scuff is hardly visible in person, and I did my best to accentuate it in the photo.

&#x200B;

**~~Acrylic Tofu 60% with Dz60rgb v1 Hotswap PCB, Brass Plate, PC Plate~~**

*Asking $150 (Sold for asking)*

I was honestly surprised by how much I love this little guy. I threw some lubed gat inks on the PC plate, and the thocky sound it produced was on par with some of my higher end boards. The brass plate also produces a pretty satisfying, deep clack.

The PCB is USB-C, hotswap, and includes per-key RGB. Includes lubed and pre-clipped C3 Equalz stabilizers. Pictured switches and cable are NOT included.

&#x200B;

**~~Built Discipline 65 with Lubed Everglide Jades (with or without SA Foundation)~~**

*Asking $120, $200 with keycaps (sold with keycaps for asking)*

Great little board with Jade tactile switches, lightly lubed with Krytox 203. Very rounded tactile bump, producing a deep thocky sound (especially with SA caps).

The PCB is USB-C, and is programmable via QMK. Stabs are GMK screw-ins, clipped and lubed.

I can throw in [SA Foundation (base kit and kit 4)](https://kbdfans.com/products/in-stockmaxkey-foundation-sa-keycaps-set) for an additional $80, as priced above.","[US-IL] [H] Acrylic Tofu 60% w/Dz60rgb hotswap, Bento Nano macropad, white Discipline 65 build [W] PayPal"

Bot sniped my last post due to bad title format,

Looks like I am going to be long distance moving in the mid-term future, so going to clear a majority of my collection so I don't have to take too much stuff /fear of something being damaged/would need the money more.

This is not FCFS. Prioritizing trades. Prices are not firm, if you feel something is expensive and you’re interested, lmk and we can work something out. All of my items are insured for the full price when shipping USPS ( flat rate box, so like 10-15$ for shipping with insurance?) , for international we can discuss if you want me to declare lower value. If you don't see a '+shipping' next to the item, the shipping is on me .

SP SA Bee: Base kit, Novelties, LED kit, and yellow space bars : Not available

SP SA Hunter Killua: $375 + Shipping

Mercury Rocketeer Metal Enter key Artisan, never used, this thing is HEAVY...may need to spring swap your enter switch, the weight makes it mushy to use if your spring game is weak. $120

Mt3 Godspeed Ares: Alphas and Ares mods, has a good amount of use, but since it's PBT there is no shine. AvailableFOR 99, buyer cancelled

GMK Bento: Brand new , never used, never removed from Packaging. ( Except the macro pad, i took it out to check for damages, never plugged it in ). Treat everything as + shipping , but depending on bundle options, shipping will vary.

TX CPv2 **SOLD** Vint Black **SOLD**

Here is the third harvest. This time it's a 1988 Wyse Terminal.

First harvest found here ([First Harvest](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/f5m3oq/usmih_vintage_mx_black_switches_from_1988_wyse/))

Second harvest found here ([Second Harvest](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/f6n4ot/usmih_vintage_mx_black_switches_from_1986_wyse/))

I will try to be transparent as possible, so please read carefully before purchase.

These switches, about **x102 ish** of them, were desoldered from a single 1988 Wyse Terminal Board. I used Hakko FR301 to desolder, so it did a nice job.I ultrasonically cleaned each of the components separately.I dried and assembled 10 switches to test on my hotswap board and all 10 switches worked.\*\*But that is not to say all of them will work. I do not guarantee this!\*\*I then lubed (205g0) and filmed (tx film) two switches, and it feels amazing like the first two harvest!!! (I will include these two sample as assembled in the purchase)And as I did before, I tested with creams, and black ink v2s.And I like it more then both of them.

You may also have a missing spring, stem, top, or bottom housing, but I really tried to make sure I got all of them in the ziplock bag.

**SOLD** I am looking for $145 shipped OBO for the switches only. (Priority Small Box)

\*\*IMPORTANT PLEASE READ\*\*As these switches are 32 years old, I would take caution when handling these. When I assembled the 10 switches, I noticed a housing wobble, but films took care of it perfectly! So I would say films are a MUST!!! Also, the springs that come with these work perfectly fine, but I would recommend using new springs as well, 65g would go perfect with these. If you do so, you'll have one of the smoothest linear you had the pleasure of trying.

**SOLD** I am also selling my beloved TX CPv2, this was my first custom board, that I never got around to building. I tested the pcb to make it works, but other then that, it stayed in the bag it came in.I really hope this goes to a good home. Looking for $725 shipped, don't be afraid to make an offer, as these are relatively rare. Or I will be interested in a 75%, TKL or other interesting CP layout boards.

Thanks for reading this long post! And I'll happy to answer any questionsPlease comment before PM.","[US-MI][H] Vintage MX Black Switches from 1988 Wyse Terminal Board, TX CPv2 Black Brand New Unbuilt [W] Paypal, GMK Set, Keyboards (75%, TKL, CP Layout)"

Hi all! I have a few things for sale/trade today.

**70x Gateron Inks** - Got these with the NK65, used them for about a month and switched them off the board. Completely stock, V2, but like I said they came with my NK65.

**Drop x Red Samurai Ortho Kit** - Unopened. Bought from Drop and then sold my ortho board since it wasn't for me. Will ship in bags, can ship in box, but will cost more to cover shipping.

**Space Caps Chief Artisan + Blank**

**Glown Off KiBuu Artisan**

**Mango Canoe built w/ Healios lubed 3204** - Used for roughly two months Looking to trade this or towards for a PC Think 6.5. Preferably an unbuilt kit. Willing to include GMK Bento (**but not the artisans**) if the trade is right. If no trade comes through, I'll set a price, but right now this is strictly for trade. IF more pics are needed, I can surely provide then.

+ **Blank white HHKB Type-S Professional 2 - $SOLD shipped CONUS**

  I got this board last year, used it for about about 2 months then put it away to use some of my other keyboards. I just don't use it too often anymore and do prefer linear switches for my day to day typing and work. I will include a full set of Topre-MX sliders from 1UPkeyboards. I am missing 2 of the original sliders though, one I gave to a friend and the other one I have no idea where it went, but I always put some artisans in those spots anyway. The alphas all have Deskeys silencing rings on them as well.

70,1582736612.0,/r/mechmarket/comments/f9wcop/au_h_gmk_bento_basespacesalmon_rama_caplarge_blue/,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking to trade my [GMK Bento collection](https://imgur.com/a/wCYgY35). This consists of a base kit, space kit, salmon Rama cap and large blue bento deskmat.

The base kit has been used minimally for approximately one month, with little (if any) shine visible. The space kit has been opened but only the white Alice bars have been used. The RAMA cap has been mounted on a board and the stem feels a little tight, but it is in perfect aesthetic condition. The deskmat has been opened to inspect, but never used.

I've been on a bit of a Wes Anderson kick lately, so I'm hoping to trade this bundle for either SA Grand Budapest (alphas+modifiers) or SA Kobayashi (alphas+modifiers). However, I'm always on the look out for interesting trades. I will consider keycap sets, modern boards and vintage boards. Feel free to make a trade offer, the worst I can do is say no :) Additionally, I am more than happy to post worldwide.

Thanks for taking the time to look, hope to hear some offers soon.","[AU] [H] GMK Bento Base+Space+Salmon RAMA Cap+Large Blue Deskmat [W] SA Grand Budapest, SA Kobayashi, Interesting Trades"

Hi mech market

**SELLING**
-

Today I am selling various goods once again.

~~**GMK Oblivion v2 Base Kit**~~ **SOLD**

Oblivion v2 Base Kit was the very first GMK set that blew my mind when I got into keyboards. Now that I’ve finally obtained a set, I actually realize that I don’t like it too much on the boards I have — I would love it if I had a black or gray board. Mounted once, typed on for 5 minutes, unmounted. I’m too lazy to put all the keys back in the tray and such, so I will sell it shipped in ziplock bags. Comes with the entire base kit, fixed “Hello, World!” Key. There is also a cardboard tray containing 12 keys that has never been opened, still shrink-wrapped. Just goes to show that I have not really used this set. **I am looking to sell this for $178**. I’ll probably prioritize good feedback / trade history.

[Pic3](https://i.imgur.com/YgLPCk8.jpg)

[Pic4](https://i.imgur.com/VnvCrNu.jpg)

[Switches](https://i.imgur.com/rW0EvfE.jpg)

Kind of a light IC on this one, I do not plan to sell. Quite literally just built it, just a day old. It’s my first Alice style keyboard and I am really enjoying the layout. Mainly looking for trades — nothing particular in mind, however I would be likely on trading for a wildcard lubrigante kit, or wonderland pcbs + cash. Not looking to sell but you can PM me if you are interested. Will definitely be joining the R2 for these. Also recommend those interested in this layout to join the HR round 2 for these since they are an affordable way to give it a shot :) Details on build:

- Clear Lubrigante case (good condition and only a few days old, though note that the clear acrylic is insanely prone to scratches so I have no guarantees on that. Also putting it together without small bits of dust / markings in the layers is super hard unless I have a dust-free environment, which I do not). So there may be some signs of dust as well.
- Black Wonderland PCB (USB-C)
- Mauve Sky Switches (mauve bottoms, mauve stems, mauve springs, Outemu Clear no-slot tops) lubed with 205g0 — no films needed / possible due to very high tolerance of Outemu tops. Had stock mauves, didn’t like the way they sounded, built these and sold the rest of my stock mauves. Outemu no-slot tops eliminate all stem wobble COMPLETELY, in addition to making the sound much deeper ([small example, not worth much but noticeable diff](https://i.imgur.com/verGOOz.mp4)). I can include the stock Mauve tops.
- Everglide / Durock stabilizers. 2u Gray Everglide stabs on the two spacebars, 2u Purple Durock stabs on the enter / left shift. Lubed with 205g0 and dielectric grease, bandaid modded.

[**Typing on Lubrigante**](https://i.imgur.com/XJGwinu.mp4)

**WANT**
-

**Gateron Milk Black**

Looking for ~70 of these. May buy a couple more if you have them and don’t want to split them. Ideally I would like the black bottom milky top variety. 1upkeyboards is the only place in the US that has these in stock, but they are $0.40 each versus NK’s $0.24 each, not to mention NK’s has black bottoms. If you are willing to part with a set for a decent price let me know.

**Alice-style suggestions**

I want a metal Alice-style board in USB-C, preferably aluminum. I did some brief searching online and options seem extremely limited. Any suggestions that I may have missed would be cool. Thanks

**Springs** If you want to get rid of unused bags of springs, I would be interested in TX / Sprit 65/70/63.5s. Also interested in picking up springs from Mauve / Lilac switches if you’ve swapped yours out.

**Wonderland USB-C PCB**

want it ^ 

**HHKB Pro Classic?**

Mainly looking for a USB-C variant.. almost bought one straight from Fujitsu for $229 the other day but changed my mind. If you can offer a price that I cannot really decline then I may take it :P

[Typing Test](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uM2V2wD_p_8gw85Qrabxj5AjXGtLJQDC/view?usp=sharing) \- Different keycaps, but sounds almost identical

Hello Mechmarket, today I will be posting one of my favorite pieces in my collection, but its time to move on as I have more important things to spend time on.

I have a blue FMJ Poker 60, which was a group buy years ago. Stainless steel bottom weights. One of the best looking tray mounts, in my opinion.

Aluminum Plate - Matches the grey/blue scheme well. This was used prior to me rebuilding the board, excellent condition.

Waldo 60 PCB - Greenwald designs makes a great product, and I had to put this pcb in it. Hunted for this pcb for months after they sold out. The Led's are on the bottom so there is no lighting that is visible.

Massdrop Holy Panda switches - brand new switches prior to this build, used as much as the keycaps.

GMK TA90 Keycaps - I bought them brand new to complete the board, used them in a couple typing tests, but nothing else. I have the complete base set as well as the icon mods, which will be shipped in baggies, besides the typing tests on the caps that are on the board the other keycaps are unmounted/unused

This was my dream keyboard build, but its too nice for me to use. It was more of a show piece for me as I invested a lot of time and money into it. I just want it to go to a good home with someone that will use it and take care of it. I know compared to some enthusiast's keyboards on this Reddit group it doesn't compare, but it really is my favorite build. Everything in this build is in mint condition, besides the case which has the couple minor blemishes as addressed below.

Note: There are a couple minor blemishes in the case, just from its age, not because of lack of care. The bottom left corner has a very small mark in the paint, and the diamond in the bottom had a small mark in it from the previous seller, and I tried to fix it by sanding it a bit, it helped but it is still noticeable. I WILL NOT part this out/sell parts individually, just looking to sell this as a complete build. **The last picture in the album is prior to the Waldo PCB, it initially had a GH60 PCB, and no sorb.**

Asking **750** including shipping (within the US), as I have at least that much into it, without including the labor. However, if you are seriously interested, PM me. Thanks for looking!",[US-MI] [H] FMJ Poker 60 [W] Paypal

~~**89 Holy Mint Pandas lubed with 3203 and spring-swapped to 63.5g $140 shipped SOLD**~~

~~These are Mint Holy Pandas swapped with 63.5g Sprint springs and lubed with Tribosys 3203 by another user with the Nathan Kim method, with no lube on the legs to retain tactility. 67 of them were mounted on a hot swap board briefly for about a week, and none were ever soldered. From the 89 switches, 80 has the Halo True stem (salmon color), and the last 9 has the Halo Clear stem (clear color). With the 63.5g springs, these holy pandas bottom out almost immediately after the tactile bump, and I always bottom out while typing so it’s satisfying for me. For those who don’t like bottoming out, maybe these aren’t for you.~~

All of the kits have been opened at least once because I received a second set of caps from Massdrop due to legends being offset or not straight.  I mixed-and-matched the two sets until I had one full set that had perfect legends.  If it says unused, it means that I've never typed on them or put them on stems.  Even the kits that I've typed on show no signs of wear, they were used very minimally as I rotate through many keyboards.

I know the Godspeed price is high because I have a lot of kits.  I will break apart the bundle if I can find people to take all the pieces.","[CA-BC] [H] GMK Pulse Mitolet + Ergo, Godspeed MT3 (lots of kits) [W] PayPal"

Hi all,

Got a few things to sell - all  **CONUS** only:

1. **Sold -** Leopold FC750R Dolch Keycaps. I took them off right after I received the keyboard so they are brand new. Looking for $55 shipped. Please note keycaps only, the tray in the photo will not be included.

3. **SOLD** \- GMMK TKL Barebones (Keycaps and switches in the photo not inluded). Bought 4 days ago. It works fine. I just don't like it that much aesthetically. I bought it for $70 so I am selling it for $65 shipped.

Hey everyone!

Before we get started, I'm looking to purchase V1 Zilents/Zealios and Black Ink switches. Specifically V1 Zilents/Zealios though as I find the bump more pleasing.

Also looking to purchase an HB85. Maybe a Matrix 1.2 if its the dark blue color or black (extra points if its qmk pcb). And a Duck lightsaver pcb/plate.

I'll purchase or trade for any of the above. 

***Today's for sale items are....***

\- GMK Pulse - Micons and Hangul -> not looking to split at this time unless there are 2 buyers. Excellent condition. Used for maybe 4-5 hours total. $180

Standard shipping terms and conditions below:

\- **$10** for artisans / **$15** for keysets (shipped in ziploc bags) / **$25** for keysets (shipped in tray) via Singapore Post registered (6-10 working days usually; please check your tracking arrangements - [for example](https://www.singpost.com/services-announcement/usa-%E2%80%93-registered-letter-mail), any registered mail going to USA will not have detailed tracking after it crosses the border and is handed over to USPS).

If you require more security and / or insurance, I can ship via DHL Express (*2-3 days and fully trackable*) at a significantly higher price - let me know and I'll quote actuals for you, but it's probably around **$30-40** for artisans/keysets before insurance costs. I prefer this for more expensive artisans or trades (for trades, I'll arrange DHL for you as well - all you need to do is print out the waybill/invoice I'll generate for ya on your end and schedule a pickup).

\- For boards, I strictly ship via DHL Express only. Shipping is **$55** worldwide (actually a bit more than that actual cost-wise as aluminium and brass are p. heavy, but I'll eat a bit of the expense for ya).

3. I will declare your item at full value and with no additional insurance beyond default registered post/DHL coverage, unless otherwise explicitly instructed.

4. Please comment before PMing. I can be reached on Discord at kronograf#0001 too - feel free to hit me up!

I bought these from the latest drop. They are my first GMK set and I thought they covered my 4x12 split board well enough. It turns out they don't cover the board to my liking and it also turns out I really dislike GMK caps. :(

I paid $135 shipped for these from Drop. I'm willing to sell them for the same price even though I'd lose a little bit on the shipping.

These are OPEN but have literally only 30 seconds of typing time on the alphas. They were put back in the box as soon as the picture was taken.

I would prefer to trade these. I'm interested in:

* SA Leviathan (the full set but only need the ortho + alphas and preferably mac kit for now).
* MT3 /dev/tty ortho set
* XDA ortho sets
* The new MDA Big Bang set
* Anything you think might look good on an acrylic Levinson

Plus/minus money on top depending on the trade. Let me know what you have. Thanks!","[US-FL] [H] GMK Oblivion v2 Assembly Base Kit [W] PayPal, SA Leviathan Ortho, or other sculpted ortho keysets"

PC Singa v2 - ~~$650 + shipping~~ SOLD

 * [Typing Test](https://youtu.be/H-FkDl7QZMM)
 * Built with Kailh Creams, lubed with 205G0
 * Pre-retool GMK stabs, lubed and bandaid modded
 * As far as the exterior goes, the case is in perfect condition. I didn't see any noticeable imperfections
 * Brass plate is starting to patina slightly, you can see it a bit in the pics.

Duck LSv3 - ~~$550 + shipping~~ SOLD

 * Aluminum plate
 * Interior brass weight (i had to cover it in electrical tape as it doesn't sit flush w/ the case, which causes it to touch the pcb and short it)
 * Built with Kailh Pro Burgundy stems in Cherry retooled black housings. Lubed with 205G0 & Kin Switch filmed
 * Pre-retool GMK stabs, lubed and bandaid modded
 * Case also seems to be in perfect condition to me
 * Plate has some weird cosmetic markings in the bottom left. Doesn't affect the plate at all, and you can only see it when the caps are off.

SA Foundation - ~~$80 shipped~~ SOLD

 * Comes with base, kit 1, & kit 4
 * Mild use, I didn't notice any shine

SKCM Pine Black Alps x101 - ~~$60 shipped~~ SOLD

 * Disassembled and ultrasonically cleaned
 * Springs lubed with GPL-106
 * Stems lubed with PTFE Spray
 * Paper modded
 * Very good condition, I'd give them an 8.5/10

SKCM Brown Alps x32 - ~~$120 shipped~~ SOLD

 * Leftovers from a 5140
 * Extremely good condition, maybe a 9/10? 
 * I noticed a bit of spring ping on some of these, but I'm sure a bit of lube would solve that.

SKCL Green Alps x60 - ~~$60 shipped~~ SOLD

 * Very smooth, don't think you'd need to clean these, also maybe 9/10?

I'm local to Orange County if anyone is looking to pay in person.

I can ship internationally, but I'd have to add a shipping fee.

~~**Dark Grey KBD75v1 w/ Holy Mint YOK Pandas $235 shipped SOLD** [Extra pictures](https://imgur.com/a/jSHMvPy)~~

~~This is the Dark Grey case with an aluminum plate installed with stock Holy Mint Pandas I bought from another user on r/mm. Uses the stock YOK Panda springs and are un-lubed. The PCB is a solder KBD75v2 PCB with the USB-C, complete with under-glow and per-switch RGB. The stabs are GMK screw-in which are lubed and clipped. The case is in largely good condition, with tiny nicks that are basically invisible. However, there is an anodizing blemish on the left side as shown in the extra pictures, which was not disclosed to me by the original seller. If you want a demonstration of the RGB over the typing sounds, [here’s the link to the typing test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7ekG8Uyph0) (Keycaps not included). All pictures, video, and sound are taken on a phone. The extra pictures also show what layout is currently flashed on the PCB through QMK.~~

From the 89 switches, 80 has the Halo True stem (salmon color), and the last 9 has the Halo Clear stem (clear color).~~","[US-TX] [H] KBD75 built with Holy Pandas, 89 lubed Holy Pandas [W] Paypal, nice TKL boards"

I've acquired a few GMK Laser Kits and since I'm not using them, I'd rather not have them just ""sitting around"". Most keys have no visible shine.

2. GMK Laser Blocknet (No missing keys)
3. GMK Laser Mitowaves Novelties - What you see is what you get. The TRUENO key is not in the pic but it will be included. Also including a special SALTY key. 
4. GMK Laser Cyberdeck - Lots of extra keycaps that were unused. Several spacebars. What you see is what you get. Kind of a mixed bag of really good keys.

170,1582332381.0,/r/mechmarket/comments/f7kueo/usfl_h_tada68_hi_pro_build_with_epbt_keycaps/,"Hello,

Selling this keyboard I purchased as a kit from KBDfans back in November and then had rebuilt. It is lubed flawlessly and has a very nice sound. Its only issue is that the stab wire on the spacebar keeps hitting the plate upon the key returning back up. I feel this is an easy fix for anyone able to tinker with it. It appears the stainless steel plate that came with the kit does not play nice with the everglide space bar stab wire. I can throw in a bag of Cherry screw in stabs that were ordered at the same time as the keyboard. There is a chance these are not as good as prior manufactured cherry/GMK screw ins. Other than that, it works extremely well and has a full set of white LEDs. PM with any questions!

Personal reasons -- I want to sell this now, along with a lot of other keyboard stuff I have coming in. So this will go, even though it sounds amazing and feels great to type on (arguably the favorite out of my boards).

This is a Sirius 60 in HHKB layout. It is notable for its acoustics -- the entire case is manufactured from POM plastic. It is compatible with any universal left-exit PCB. It is fully built with:

- Internal Weight
- POM Plate
- Novelkeys_ x Kailh Cream switches (lubed w/ MCG 129 & spring-swapped to 62g)
- [Waldo 60 USB-C PCB](https://store.projectkeyboard.com/products/waldo-pcb-60)
- GMK Stabilizers (lubed, clipped)

The case itself is in good condition with light signs of use. It is similar to polycarbonate in the way that it picks up light scuffs and markings on its finish, though these markings are more difficult to see due to it being opaque. There is also a very slightly 'dim' spot to the left of the left shift. See photos for condition (note that all marks are only visible from a very specific, specific angle that was difficult to pick up on camera). **If you put in a few minutes and have the tools (a fine sponge), you can essentially make the entire case brand-new again.**

I am selling this as a full build as I don't have the time, energy, motivation, or resources to desolder the build and get the plate out for you.... sorry. ~~**I am looking for $369 for the case, PCB, switches, and plate.**~~ SOLD Only shipping CONUS for now. Keycaps are not included. I have two typing / sound tests included in the imgur album. Check the space bar sound!

**GMK Space Cadet Base**

Light use, with little to no shine. I've only used the TKL keys, so a lot of them remain unused.

These will be shipped out in bags, not trays.

The reflected lighting in the pictures may overemphasize or create the illusion of shine.

Here is the second harvest. This time it's a 1986 Wyse Terminal.First harvest found here ([First Harvest](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/f5m3oq/usmih_vintage_mx_black_switches_from_1988_wyse/))

I will try to be transparent as possible, so please read carefully before purchase.

These switches, about **x98 ish** of them, were desoldered from a single 1986 Wyse Terminal Board.I used Hakko FR301 to desolder, so it did a nice job.I ultrasonically cleaned each of the components separately.I dried and assembled 15 switches to test on my hotswap board and all 15 switches worked.(This time, since it's an older board, I increased the sample size to 15, first time was 10)**But that is not to say all of them will work. I do not guarantee this!**I then lubed (205g0) and filmed (tx film) two switches, and it feels amazing!!! (I will include these two sample as assembled in the purchase)And as I did before, I tested them to creams, and inks. And I like it more then both of them.

You may also have a missing spring, stem, top, or bottom housing, but I really tried to make sure I got all of them in the ziplock bag.

**SOLD**   
I am looking for $130 shipped OBO for the switches only. (Priority Small Box)

\*\*IMPORTANT PLEASE READ\*\*As these switches are 34 years old, I would take caution when handling these.When I assembled the 15 switches, I noticed a housing wobble, but films took care of it perfectly!So I would say films are a MUST!!!Also, the springs that come with these work perfectly fine, but I would recommend using new springs as well.If you do so, you'll have one of the smoothest linear you had the pleasure of trying.

# What I got:

SA 1976 is in excellent condition, used on one board, maybe used two days total.  There are some minor scuffs on a few keys incurred from shipping from Signature Plastics, most noticeable on the space bar.

SA Carbon Salty was never used.  I forget I even had them!

So for the weird stuff... I am selling my ""extra plastic"".  I only use ortho 1u keys, so I have a lot of extras that are just sitting in storage.  I know some folks might want to try cobbling together something, or needed just a few more keys in a row to really make their set work.  With that in mind I'm selling my spare GMK Laser and GMK Yuri keys.  I won't send them in trays unless the seller is willing to pay the extra for shipping (USPS charges a lot for boxes > 12 inches).

GMK Laser extras includes some keys from [GMK Laserwave](https://drop.com/buy/53110) , Blocknet, Spacebars, and Mitowaves.

~~hello mm today I have a noxary 268.2 for sale that I do not use enough to justify keeping but I still want to keep it because it is very nice board but I simply cannot because I am going to go poor if I do.~~

~~Anyways the keyboard is in great condition besides some minor problems or maybe major depending how you look at it. The first most obvious defect is the crack at the stabilizer screw on the back of the board from over-tightening. It does not protrude out of the case but it is visible but should not affect performance at all. It is only cosmetic. There are a couple of pictures of it in the timestamp. There is also a scratch that is inside the case but is visible from outside that is medium-sized near the crack and this occurred from a screwdriver. Pictures of that are also in the timestamp. There are also some very minor scratches on the brass weight which again are included in the timestamp. Other than than that I have included all sides of the board and there are no more problems that I could find.~~

&#x200B;

~~It comes with 2 pcbs which one is soldered on with a pc plate and tealios. The teals are lubed with 205g0, filmed with white tx films and spring swapped to 60g tx springs. The GMK Screw in stabs are both clipped and lubed on both pcbs. the second pcb comes with a 5mm brass plate. The PC plate is 2.5mm I believe. The second pcb has been desoldered before but it is tested on switch hitter and everything is working. If you have any questions, pm.~~

Hey guys.  Unfortunately I'm not a millionaire so to keep this hobby somewhat sustainable I have to let some things go.  This is a cool grey zephyr with a mill maxed pcb.  I currently have it built with lubed and filmed black inks and gmk striker.  The board will be sold **without** switches or keycaps but if you want the switches we can work something out.  If you have any questions, want more pictures, or just want to talk about keyboards, feel free to PM me.  Thanks!

Hi all, I'm looking to clear out a few things of mine that do not get as much use anymore. More images can be provided upon request.


I'm also interested in trading N:1 +/-PP for or purchasing artisans from [this wishlist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PcALLwiRSyE1LwRWHkpiKqtLO8US5q_RvTa0s9LX7PY/edit?usp=sharing). I will also look at other offers, worst I can say is no. Trades can be +/- paypal.

I prefer to ship within CONUS, shipping not included in prices, $5 shipping for artisans. Bundles will be prioritized and discounted with each additional item.

Please comment before PM and please do not use chat, it never seems to work on my end. Thanks for looking!

Hey there, I have a pink Unikorn I may consider trading. It's currently built up with a brass plate, Sakurios, 62g Sprit springs lubed w/ vpf 1514, switches w/ Christo 129, gmk clip in stabs (clipped + lubed w/ 205g0). I also have two extra new and functioning PCBs, no extra gaskets or plates. No external marks to note, there are marks internally as the anode hooks were huge. They're not visible built. The weight is getting a good patina on it because I don't clean it. You probably could if you prefer it that way.
Can include bento set and spacebars if necessary. 


What I’m looking for:

[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/f2v2bq/euee_h_rama_olive_enter_keycap_yok_holy_trash/)

So my spring cleaning reached a point of no return when I'm starting to sell stuff I was originally hesitant to sell. Heh, so much for trying new things!

Short version of boring notes:

1.	Prices are lower or on par with what I've paid for the items I'm selling. If you feel like it is not the case, do let me know!
2.	Not FCFS, bundles, local buyers and EU buyers are preferred
3.	All items can be traded
4.	Shipping rates are around 5-25€ for EU, 12-30€ for international
5.	**No Reddit chat please! User page -> More options (under Follow/Chat buttons) -> Send a message.**
6.	**Please comment under this post before DM-ing me**

Trades I'm looking for:

1.	ePBT Kuro Shiro
2.	Other ePBT keysets
3.	Any MX HHKB keyboards that are not integrated plate
4.	Artisans (high quality sculpts only)

So, now to an updated and dare menu for today:

---
-	**Item**: HHKB Professional 2 Sachiel Edition (modded)
-	**Price**: 500€ (easy OBO)

This is an extremely hard sell for me, both in a sense that I do love this build and it is very much ""unique"" to the point that I doubt anybody will like it lol. But well, have to let it go to buy even more keyboards.

Specs and what comes with the keyboard:

* HHKB Professional 2 black
* Vibration absorption mat glued to the outer bottom of a case (the one you can get from Smart Imports website)
* Silver HHKB sticker applied
* Redux Heavy / Light domes installed emulating variable domes of Realforces, thus heavies for stronger fingers, lights for pinkies and ring fingers. I can provide a pic with exact positions of the domes on request from a potential buyer.
* Everything lubed with Tribosys 3204, not over lubed from what I can tell
* Hasu controller (bluetooth) + 2000mah  battery installed. Lasts for about a day and a half on battery.
* Foam inside a case, like the one you get for camping mats
* KBDFans silence o-rings installed
* KBDFans JTK MX slider on ESC key with Sachiel metal artisan
* Custom dyed blanks themed after Neon Genesis Evangelion angel Sachiel
*  Comes with a decent MechFashion sleeve (black, wine red fleece inside, logo of Neon Genesis Evangelion Seele  organization on both sides) 

Gotchas:

* Vibration absorption mat glued a bit misaligned
* Sticker applied a tad bit misaligned
* Spacebar spring does its springy rattly thing, was trying to fix a couple of times but in the end just sucked it up. Should be still fixable with enough love. 
* To install the battery for a controller I had to remove a part of a standoff inside the case (middle one on the top side of a case). Does not affect anything but it's FYI.

Notes:

* Typing video can be provided on a request of a potential buyer. Bear in mind that phone microphone will be used thus sound won’t be 1:1 with how it really is
* From my last estimation, this build costed me around $800. I realize nobody would buy it for these money so I want to recoup at least a part of my original investment.

-	**Item**: SKDC Topre blanks (A1-A3 on a timestamp)
-	**Price**: 10€ each, 25€ for all three + shipping

All of them are ESC row (top row). Scarcely used on my HHKB Professional 2. Look stunning, nice caps I just can't find any use for them.

-	**Item**: Various Topre blanks (A4-E1 on a timestamp)
-	**Price**: 5€ each, all 23 for 60€ + shipping

A4-B4 are ESC row (top row). B5-B7 are backspace row. C1-C6 are home (enter) row. C7, D1 are shift row (FN key). D row blue caps are backspace/tab and right shift (HHKB), grey cap is control, cyan cap is enter.

All of these are used scarcely for around 2 month.

-	**Item**: KeyForge Mulder V3 Sakura (Purge sale 2019)
-	**Price**: 65€ + shipping

Never used, never mounted. As new. Shipped in KeyForge bag.

*If you're wondering which keyset this cap will match, its upcoming GMK Daring obv (I'm no expert but it should be almost 1:1 to a colour of darling alphas thus will easily go on a top right corner for keebs with split backspace)*.

[Fixed timestamp](https://i.imgur.com/C75qv7b.jpg)

I'm selling my beloved Doro67 finished in e-white with an e-white bottom weight — I have too many keyboards at this time and need to let something go. The case itself has no visible scratches or flaws (that I saw, just examined it now). It's built with Gateron Yellows and GMK screw-in stabs. The daughterboard had resoldered feet because they were loose (common problem in this GB; this was months ago). I am including a magnetic USB-C to USB-A cable (black, braided).

The keyboard will come in its original packaging with everything that was inside the box. Please see the gallery below for more pictures.

I paid 430 USD for the Doro67 + shipping + import tariffs and that's what I would like for it. Shipping will be extra (around 20-25 EUR in EU, depending on the country). If you have a reasonable offer, I will consider it.

Please comment before sending a PM.

I would prefer EU shipping via DHL Parcel. Will consider other countries but it might get a big expensive.

*For full transparency:* ~~Apparently, the PC Canoe (non-bt only) is back in stock on Percent.studio's website. I'm not sure if these are extras/limited stock, but they're available as of now. Last I checked, the total comes out to be $249 + $38 shipping to US = $287.~~

I know saying this will probably drive people away from buying here, but I'd rather it be known than try to grease around and have someone call me out on it.

Asking: ~~**$400 shipped/trades**~~ **sold**

AKA the ""MiniVan Hacking Keyboard"".

From [KeebTalk](https://www.keebtalk.com/t/mhkb-from-the-van-keyboards/5989):

> The MiniVan Hacking Keyboard, or MHKB for short, is a premium case designed specifically for the MiniVan keyboard system, with a respectful nod to the greats before us. The components are CNC machined out of solid aircraft grade aluminum, ensuring...

From a [mechmarket post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/cu14bm/usga_h_mhkb_eseries_w_pearl_40_keyboard/):

> For those of you that don't know, this board is a all aluminum, 4 piece case, with a 5.1MM switch plate. The bottom piece is an integrated ""SHU"" that can be removed if you don't want any angle on the board. This is a hefty little board and looks fantastic.

This version of the MHKB (Type-E) in particular has two blockers on each side to give it an HHKB style layout.

The PCB is hot-swappable meaning no soldering is required. [It also supports QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/thevankeyboards/minivan).

&nbsp;

Includes:

* USB-C Hotswap PCB
* PCB-mount (clip-in) stabilizers, lubed with PTFE grease on the stems of housing the dielectric everywhere else
    * ~~Can replace with stock/lubed (at request) Pink C^3 Equalz screw-in stabs~~
* Bottom filled with shelf liner

Can ship with the original box if preferred.

Asking: ~~**$310 shipped OBO/trades**~~ **sold**

&nbsp;

# ~~Bundle~~

~~If anyone is interested in both the boards, I can bundle for **$620 shipped**. This can be split amongst different people if desired.~~

    * I know it's up for pre-order on Kono, but my feelings about this set have flip-flopped so many times. Ideally I would want to trade.
    * Any condition is fine, as long as it isn't super shiny on 'wasd' or something
* Dixie Deskmat (Bag)
    * I accidentally wripped my carrying bag for my Dixie mat :(
    * If you're willing to sell just the carrying bag I'd gladly buy, but I could also buy a deskmat together with one. I'm open to any of them.

The Lunar was B+ stock with the major issue being the anodizing. It has since been cerakoted in gray which fixed the cosmetic issues. There is minor pitting in one area on the bottom of the board and a very small dent on the bottom plate by the usb port. Pictures are included of both issues. The board was built with green alps that were spring swapped to a heavier weight of 70 cN. I would prefer to sell the board as is but am able to desolder the green alps and knock $50 dollars off the price to not include them.

I have 7 sets of caps from ultratec minicom iv's and superprints. Some of the caps have a degree of yellowing to the legends so I included pictures of each set next to 4 modifiers from a bnib set of gmk wob. None of these will include the bnib mods I included for reference, only the caps pictured (alphas and some 1u mods) as well as an 8u spacebar that came with each board.

Ergodox-EZ Glow w/ tenting kit. Has lubed Kailh speed copper switches, and I added sound dampening foam to the inside case. This board sounds really good now, very solid, instead of the hollow quacking as stock. It's a joy to type on. Comes with original box. I purchased this new from Ergodox-EZ in Oct 2019, and decided that I am much more interested in tiny split keyboards instead. So it's barely used, other than the mods. ~~$275 + shipping $250 if you don't want the switches.~~ SOLD

**SOLD**

Hey all, 

Selling my Tofu 60% with the DZ60 RBG hotswappable PCB. 

Comes with GMK screw in stabs (lubed but not clipped), brass plate, PCB, USB-C to USB A cable and the case (bought as Navy blue but it's in between a navy and light blue)

Board is in almost perfect condition. There are some discoloring around the ports and open holes from manufacturing but other than that, I have not put any keycaps on this board, just switches for testing.

It will NOT come with the switches.  

Looking for $180 including shipping with the US. Not looking to ship this international please

No trades either.

I am looking to part ways with my PolyCarb E6.5 WKL board. The buttery smackdown that this board offers has treated me so very well. The board is gasket mount with Lubed Gateron Black inks with 25g0. Likewise we have lubed Zeal stabs with 25g0 as well. All LEDs are in working order, see timestamp.

As amazing as this board is I find myself striving for more THOCK in my life and dont want to dismantle this beaut.

Happy Valentines day r/mm. I'd like to sell some boards that I don't want. CONUS only and comment before pming.

**~~KBD8X MKii SOLD~~**

* Some marks due to it being polycarbonate and on the brass weight as well, none of it is visible during use. It is also missing a screw on the bottom left, but that also does not affect usage in any way.
* I built this with Mint Holy Pandas lubed with 3204 without lubing the legs and GMK Screw in stabs with 205g0, clipped and lubed. 
* Does not include keycaps but I can include it if you want.
* Board types and sounds like a dream. Sadly I've realized I'm not a tactile guy ://.

**EDIT #2: The keycaps are still on sale if you want them for $160 shipped!**

**EDIT: I forgot to mention that you will need to flash the keyboard if you want to utilize different colored rgb.** 

**Asking $550 + shipping (no shipping if local) without the keycaps or $700 ($670 local) shipped with the keycaps (GMK Olive Base Set)**

* If no one buys the keycaps with the board then the keycaps alone would be **$160 shipped**

* A flawless board with no scratches or scuffs

Prices include fees and shipping within the CONUS. $5 discount for every additional cap in a bundle e.g. buy three save $10. Not FCFS, priority to trades and bundles. Can also trade for or outright buy the caps that I am looking for at the bottom.

The gamers are for trades for other gamers. I'm really picky so I probably won't agree to trade for anything not on my wants list.

And as always, please leave a comment before PM'ing. Thanks!

It has been for only about a day; no shine. I also have an unopened set of the Pale Blue Accent Mods. I will be shipping this set in bags.

2 Things up for sale today:

**Red Pearl 40% Keyboard**

~~Unintentionally I've kind of become an expert on these boards as I've owned 5 different ones now.  This is board #68 and I purchased it about 8 months ago as a desoldered board.  I cleaned it up a bit and rebuilt it with Lubed Gateron Black Inks and a Lubed Zeal Healio in the spacebar.  The switches were lubed with Krytox 205g0.  It has a screw in GMK Stabilizer for the space bar that's been lubed with Christo-Lube MCG 129 (I like how thick it is for this) and Dielectric grease on the bars.~~  

~~For those that don't know, there were 146 Pearls made in the GB.  There were only 7 red ones, and of those 7 only 5 had brass plates.  This case is FLAWLESS.  This is one of the cleanest and best condition pearls I've ever owned.  There is not a single scratch or nick in this case and the red color is FANTASTIC.~~  

~~I'm selling it since I rarely use it and my other Pearl is what has been my daily for a few weeks now and I'm looking to fund other purchases.~~

~~I'm asking $395 shipped with Paypal fees included to CONUS.~~

**DSS Honeywell**

~~Originally purchased to go on to the Red Pearl, this keyset has seen very little use.  If you don't know what this keyset is, it's for 40% layouts only.  This will not cover a 60%!!  Just want to make sure you know which set this is.~~  

~~Again this set has seen maybe a total of 5 hours of use and it's got no shine on it or any blemishes.~~  

~~I'm asking exactly what I paid for it which is $120 shipped CONUS with PP Fees included.~~

Hey there

Selling my GMK Penumbra set. Alphas have been barely used as I used the alphas from a 9009 set. The mod keys have been used casually for about 18 months.


Looking for $120 USD shipped in bags. Add 15 extra if you want the tray. Shipping is free in Australia and as such price is $110 USD tray or bag. Also open to offers. Feel free to PM me

Hey gang,

Just doing some early spring cleaning and decided this was one of the items I no longer need. Trying to gather funds for future projects. Brand new, still in packaging Metropolis Base Kit and signs. Looking for $230. This covers all paypal/shipping fees. Really would like to keep this within the CONUS to keep shipping costs down, but let me know ahead of time if this is an issue and we can work something out.

As always, comment before PMing and thanks for checking out the post. Not interested in selling the base kit/signs seperately at the moment.

All sold! Thank you! :) 

A few things up on the block today, hoping to recoup from a recent purchase! 

TGR 910 - amazing condition. Brass weight is perfect. No scratches, dings, or dents on the board. There are a few tiny scuffs on the pc, but they’re very minor. I can send more detailed photos if interested! It’ll come built with retooled blacks lubed with 205G0 and spring swapped to 55g springs on a brass plate. The thing looks, types, and sounds like a dream. Hoping to get $1800 here // willing to accept DMG/Spacebars + cash! SOLD

100 unused stock Sakurios - $95 SOLD

GMK Paperwork - $100 shipped in a bag. Lightly used, Great shape here too. SOLD

> Again this is a slightly updated version of my previous post. Prices were not changed much but I do have more  Rama (tm) stuff for sale/trade now.

So my early spring cleaning went quite well! Still have some items to sell though, hence I'm back. A couple of notes before that:

1. **I did my best to specify a fair price for each and every item**. All of the below items are sold for about the same price I spent to acquire them (including shipping of course). I do not want to be a dick so if you feel that some prices below are inflated - definitely let me know.
2. All items can be traded
3. Not FCFS, bundles, local buyers and EU buyers are preferred
4. Bundles of 200€ or more (in total) get a free worldwide shipping
5. Shipping rates are around 5-15€ for EU, 12-20€ for international (depending on an item). All items are tracked across European Union. For shipments to US they will be tracked only until they enter US (because USPS does not provide tracking to Omniva, which is a local post company). You'll get a tracking number nevertheless, as well as a link where you'd be able to verify that recipient of the package is indeed you.
6. **No Reddit chat please PLEASE NO REDIT CHAT ONCE AGAIN.**
7. **Please comment under this post before DM-ing me**

As mentioned, most of the PBT dye sub keycaps are Cherry MX compatible. Technically they all are, but some have odd shapes and sizes so they will likely not be used on a normal keyboard layout.

2 Things up for sale today:

**Red Pearl 40% Keyboard**

Unintentionally I've kind of become an expert on these boards as I've owned 5 different ones now.  This is board #68 and I purchased it about 8 months ago as a desoldered board.  I cleaned it up a bit and rebuilt it with Lubed Gateron Black Inks and a Lubed Zeal Healio in the spacebar.  The switches were lubed with Krytox 205g0.  It has a screw in GMK Stabilizer for the space bar that's been lubed with Christo-Lube MCG 129 (I like how thick it is for this) and Dielectric grease on the bars.  

For those that don't know, there were 146 Pearls made in the GB.  There were only 7 red ones, and of those 7 only 5 had brass plates.  This case is FLAWLESS.  This is one of the cleanest and best condition pearls I've ever owned.  There is not a single scratch or nick in this case and the red color is FANTASTIC.  

I'm selling it since I rarely use it and my other Pearl is what has been my daily for a few weeks now and I'm looking to fund other purchases.

I'm asking $400 shipped with Paypal fees included to CONUS.

**DSS Honeywell**

[Keycap Layout](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2016/1211/products/download_6b6386e7-a5bc-4143-93e4-fbfaaab6d46a_1090x@2x.png?v=1568567090)

Originally purchased to go on to the Red Pearl, this keyset has seen very little use.  If you don't know what this keyset is, it's for 40% layouts only.  This will not cover a 60%!!  Just want to make sure you know which set this is.  

Again this set has seen maybe a total of 5 hours of use and it's got no shine on it or any blemishes.  

I'm asking exactly what I paid for it which is $120 shipped CONUS with PP Fees included.

# Update3: I'll be splitting the remaining Carbon kits as it seems I can get enough people interested. I'll be creating a new post in the following weeks, but if you're interested reach out to me and I'll ping you when I'm ready to post.  Doing this is more time consuming than I thought. 

Update2: I've replied at all of the PMs. If I haven't I probably didn't get a PM from you.  At this moment most of the items are pending.  I'll be reaching out to the interested people if any deal falls through, but reach out if you're interested in something.

I'll be making a separate post in a week or two to try to split the smaller Carbon kits.

Update1: Got busy at work.  Will reply PMs later tonight.

yes I type like a potato

Selling my quantum blue volcano, the exterior finish is flawless. I have 2 working PCBs, 1 with creams and 1 with polar pandas.

for the polar pandas, the alphas are holy and mods are linear, to my preference, Ill include some clear stems and stock polars if you want to change that. Holy ones have 3204 on housing, not on legs.

creams lubed with 3204 on slider and 205g0 on housing

I dont want to desolder >:(

I also want to sell GMK metropolis, preferably with it so bundles take priority.

My prices are set based off what i've seen and because 2 working PCBs from this GB is an accomplishment

I have a mint condition Pok3r RGB with gateron brown switches. Has a Black aluminum case and white switch plate. It comes with the stock keycaps that originally came with the keyboard as well as a set of carbon keycaps. There is nothing wrong with this board, I am just trying to thin the stock of boards I no longer use. I am looking to get $100 obo (not including shipping) for the keyboard and extra set of caps.

The only trades I will consider are Minivans or Minivan parts (including caravan) if need be I can add cash on top of trade or vice versa, or a set of dsa hyperfuse caps or 40 compatible jtk or gmk hyperfuse.

2 Things up for sale today:

**Red Pearl 40% Keyboard**

Unintentionally I've kind of become an expert on these boards as I've owned 5 different ones now.  This is board #68 and I purchased it about 8 months ago as a desoldered board.  I cleaned it up a bit and rebuilt it with Lubed Gateron Black Inks and a Lubed Zeal Healio in the spacebar.  The switches were lubed with Krytox 205g0.  It has a screw in GMK Stabilizer for the space bar that's been lubed with Christo-Lube MCG 129 (I like how thick it is for this) and Dielectric grease on the bars.  

For those that don't know, there were 146 Pearls made in the GB.  There were only 7 red ones, and of those 7 only 5 had brass plates.  This case is FLAWLESS.  This is one of the cleanest and best condition pearls I've ever owned.  There is not a single scratch or nick in this case and the red color is FANTASTIC.  

I'm selling it since I rarely use it and my other Pearl is what has been my daily for a few weeks now and I'm looking to fund other purchases.

I'm asking $400 shipped with Paypal fees included to CONUS.

**DSS Honeywell**

[Keycap Layout](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2016/1211/products/download_6b6386e7-a5bc-4143-93e4-fbfaaab6d46a_1090x@2x.png?v=1568567090)

Originally purchased to go on to the Red Pearl, this keyset has seen very little use.  If you don't know what this keyset is, it's for 40% layouts only.  This will not cover a 60%!!  Just want to make sure you know which set this is.  

Again this set has seen maybe a total of 5 hours of use and it's got no shine on it or any blemishes.  

I'm asking exactly what I paid for it which is $120 shipped CONUS with PP Fees included.

[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/eyw5yk/euee_h_tr60_hhkb_cheap_kprepublic_mx_hhkb_build/)

So my early spring cleaning went quite well! Still have some items to sell though, hence I'm back. A couple of notes before that:

1. **I did my best to specify a fair price for each and every item**. All of the below items are sold for about the same price I spent to acquire them (including shipping of course). I do not want to be a dick so if you feel that some prices below are inflated - definitely let me know.
2. All items can be traded
3. Not FCFS, bundles, local buyers and EU buyers are preferred
4. Bundles of 200€ or more (in total) get a free worldwide shipping
5. Shipping rates are around 5-15€ for EU, 12-20€ for international (depending on an item). All items are tracked across European Union. For shipments to US they will be tracked only until they enter US (because USPS does not provide tracking to Omniva, which is a local post company). You'll get a tracking number nevertheless, as well as a link where you'd be able to verify that recipient of the package is indeed you.
6. **No Reddit chat please PLEASE NO REDIT CHAT ONCE AGAIN.**
7. **Please comment under this post before DM-ing me**

Trades I’m looking for:
- ePBT Kuro Shiro (want this one badly, you can exploit my desires)
- GMK Minimal
- Other ePBT keysets
- Artisans (mostly interested in KeyForge, BroCaps, Night Caps)
- Any MX HHKB keyboards that are not integrated plate
- Any keysets that cover MX HHKB layout (tsangan bottom row, split backspace, split right shift, caps lock with “control” legend)

Items are below (I've switched away from tables because people were not happy with how it looks on mobile devices, though I'd suggest just switching to r/apolloapp if you're on iOS).

- ~~**Item**: KPRepublic HHKB case V1 build~~

~~PCB is DZ60 with RGB underglow. Build with Cherry MX Blacks (retooled, lubed with Christo-Lube MCG111), original GMK stabs, MKUltra foam between a plate and PCB. It types really well for people who enjoy soft bottom out. The case itself is a weird top mount, sides of a plate flex more then the middle.~~

~~This keyboard case went through hell. I tried to deanodize it will household items, it turned out not that bad but then I've tried to sand it down and scratched a part of the case. This can be fixed with sandpaper and a lot of determination + some kind of sealing agent to prevent aluminium from oxidation.~~

~~All cosmetic issues etc. are on timestamps above. For people who want it to look pristine, there is a [case sold by KPRepublic](https://kprepublic.com/products/xd64-xd60-60-hhkb-layout-aluminium-case-with-acrylic-diffuser?_pos=2&_sid=e958782a2&_ss=r) which should be a drop in replacement.~~

Timestamp: [https://imgur.com/a/haXCt1c](https://imgur.com/a/haXCt1c)

I'm selling a clean, no-shine base set of GMK Muted keycaps. I'm the original owner of this keyset. These keycaps were lightly used for no more than two weeks and then properly stored in thier tray/packaging. I've had them for several months waiting for the right build, but I've decided to let them go to another keyboard fan. In addition to the base set, I have a set of Accent Keys in 3C (Eraser Pink) and spacebars in 3B (Calm Green) - the colors from the 9009 keyset. They work great as accents/add-ons to the Muted keyset. I'm including them here.

Keycaps will come in the original GMK tray and packaging shown in the timestamp photo (extra keys are bagged).

Price: $300 plus shipping within the CONUS. No trades. PayPal only.

PM me if you're interested.

Good Evening /r/mechmarket 

2 Things up for sale today:

**Red Pearl 40% Keyboard**

Unintentionally I've kind of become an expert on these boards as I've owned 5 different ones now.  This is board #68 and I purchased it about 8 months ago as a desoldered board.  I cleaned it up a bit and rebuilt it with Lubed Gateron Black Inks and a Lubed Zeal Healio in the spacebar.  The switches were lubed with Krytox 205g0.  It has a screw in GMK Stabilizer for the space bar that's been lubed with Christo-Lube MCG 129 (I like how thick it is for this) and Dielectric grease on the bars.  

For those that don't know, there were 146 Pearls made in the GB.  There were only 7 red ones, and of those 7 only 5 had brass plates.  This case is FLAWLESS.  This is one of the cleanest and best condition pearls I've ever owned.  There is not a single scratch or nick in this case and the red color is FANTASTIC.  

I'm selling it since I rarely use it and my other Pearl is what has been my daily for a few weeks now and I'm looking to fund other purchases.

I'm asking $400 shipped with Paypal fees included to CONUS.

**DSS Honeywell**

Originally purchased to go on to the Red Pearl, this keyset has seen very little use.  If you don't know what this keyset is, it's for 40% layouts only.  This will not cover a 60%!!  Just want to make sure you know which set this is.  

Again this set has seen maybe a total of 5 hours of use and it's got no shine on it or any blemishes.  

I'm asking exactly what I paid for it which is $120 shipped CONUS with PP Fees included.

a note about the electrovoice. I haven't used it in like 4ish years and I no longer have means of actually testing it out.

Prices are CONUS via USPS. I am currently only shipping within the US at the moment, sorry.

Most items applicable will be shipped in a padded envelope. If you wish for it to be shipped in a box, add **$2** to the asking price and let me know in PMs.

Due to some complications, I will probably ship out 2-3 business days (at most) after payment ~~and might take a little while to respond~~; sorry in advance.

edit2: ~~currently dedicating time to respond to PMs~~. I will update the post promptly on availability.

edit3: (started numbering edits) Thank you for the PMs and interest everyone. I have chosen a seller(s) for the Creams and Halo Trues.

&nbsp;

Not necessarily FCFS. Edit1: Priority will go to bundles.

Please comment before PMing (please no Reddit Chat). I'm also available on discord (yenel#4303) if you prefer to reach me through there.

# ~~[PC Percent Canoe (Non-Bluetooth)](https://i.imgur.com/yf1M1N1.jpg)~~

**BNIB**. Will ship in original packaging.

I initially planned to build this, but life got in the way.

This is the **[non-bluetooth version](https://i.imgur.com/HkB68OR.jpg)**. Programming software and more details about the board can be found on Percent Studio's website.

~~Asking: **$420 shipped**~~ **moved to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/f4ucdg/usfl_h_pc_canoe_nonbt_mhkb_typee_w_paypal_trades/)**

# ~~[80x Novelkeys Cream Switches](https://i.imgur.com/uFcMzun.jpg)~~

Completely stock NK Creams I bought a while back.

I've never sniffed original Cream switches before, but these smell pretty fishy, maybe even a little like squid. I won't claim they're fish-stock, but they are definitely fishy.

I can sell in quantities >= 65x, but priority will go to people buying >= 70x.

Asking: ~~**$75 shipped**~~ **sold**

&nbsp;

# ~~[70x Halo True Switches](https://i.imgur.com/Zy65xx6.jpg)~~

Stock Halo True switches I received recently. Selling because I had a discount code that only applied past a certain price point on Drop, so here I am selling my extra. If you are waiting on NK's restock of YOK Trash and Purple Pandas (Feb), you can use these to make some themed Holy Pandas or other frankenswitches.

For example, if you pair the Cream housings with the True stems, you get Pacos. So many possibilities...

*These will be shipped in a bag.*

Asking: ~~**$31 shipped**~~ **sold**

&nbsp;

# ~~[enjoyPBT Valentine](https://i.imgur.com/TMrVfXZ.jpg)~~

With Valentine's Day coming up soon, this PBT keyset fits the theme with a comfy-pink feel. This set has beige mods (set A on Originative), so colors look a bit more simple and satisfying imo.

I originally bought this from a user here. The previous owner said that they just used the keys of a 65% board for a few weeks; I used the keys on a 40% for about a day. However, it is PBT, so there is no shine.

When I received the caps, I sorted them and put them into a spare GMK tray I had around. There were a few extra keys (""shine-through/light"" caps, off-centered spacebars, big-ass ISO enter) that didn't fit into the tray, so they had to be put in a separate bag.

Asking: ~~**$55 shipped** in bags, **+ $15 shipped** in GMK tray~~ **sold for $52 shipped**

---

I'm willing to offer discounts if multiple items are bought together.

Due to how big the Canoe packaging is, if it is bought together with something else I might need to ship them separate (unless I find a big enough box).

Thanks for looking, have a good day.","[US-FL] [H] PC Canoe (Non-BT), Switches (Creams, Halo Trues), ePBT Valentine [W] PayPal"

I also have the angled feet+hardware. Just haven't put em together. The purple trash pandas are all lubed with cristo 114, springs with some oil (forget), and c3 stabs with 205g0. I mod the stab pads with vinyl tape as I find band-aids too squishy.

I only used it for a day and went back to my old keyboard. please don't come with your arguments that you can get the board cheaper because in the EU we have something called import VAT that we have to pay.

Here is my Duck raven with OG invyr panda housing with Fei stem and spring. These are not from massdrop but from the original invyr panda GB where this switch was hunted and sold as exotic animols.

Hello there! Starting my spring cleaning early this year, hence want to sell and/or trade a bunch of items that I do not like or do not have much use for.

Before getting into it, a couple of notes:

1.	**I did my best to specify a fair price for each and every item**. All of the below items are sold for about the same price I spent to acquire them (including shipping of course). I do not want to be a dick so if you feel that some prices below are inflated - definitely let me know.
2.	Not FCFS, bundles, local buyers and EU buyers are preferred
3.	Bundles of 200€ or more (in total) get a free worldwide shipping
4.	Shipping rates are around 5-15€ for EU, 12-20€ for international (depending on an item)
5.	**No Reddit chat please**

Trades I’m looking for:

1.	ePBT Kuro Shiro (want this one badly, you can exploit my desires)
2.	GMK Minimal
3.	Other ePBT keysets
4.	Artisans (mostly interested in KeyForge, BroCaps, Night Caps)
5.	Any MX HHKB keyboards that are not integrated plate
6.	Any keysets that cover MX HHKB layout (tsangan bottom row, split backspace, split right shift, caps lock with “control” legend)

Today’s menu: (shipping is not included, timestamps and extra pics above)

GMK stabs lubed with dielectric grease and silicone grease (clipped and band aided). Brass back weight + 2 spare acrylic back plates. Partially silenced with a high density foam (bottom part of a case, about 50% of total area). Integrated plate 4mm, some anodization imperfections on a bottom (see pics).~~|
|~~KPRepublic HHKB case V1 (built, no caps)~~|~~80€ OBO or trades (this case alone goes for around 75€ on AliExpress, though that one is V2)~~ **UNAVAILABLE**|~~Budget build I did a while ago. Types like a dream for people who love soft bottom out but has cosmetic imperfections. Built with Cherry MX Blacks (retooled), switches lubed with Christo-Lube MSG111, stabs are original GMK (clipped, band aided, lubed with dielectric + silicone grease). MKUltra foam in between plate and a PCB, which is DZ60 with RGB underglow. Bottom of a case is acrylic for your RGB to shine. This is top mount but a mount is a bit weird, it has no support on the sides which makes mods extra soft. Still feels very good. Cosmetic imperfections: 3 spots on a bottom part of a top part of a case, anodization just wiped off (see pics). Tolerances between a top case and a place where caps are mounted are not that great thus expect gaps. [Extra pics](https://imgur.com/a/XUlK9FW/) (these are pre anodization blemishes, full build).~~|

|Topre artisan and regular blanks grab bag 26 pcs (see pics, all apart from 3 artisan caps in a bottom right part of a box)|75€ OBO or trades (feel free to abuse me to get the price down, I’m not sure what are they worth).|These were gathered throughout the last year.

Thanks for looking and hope you’re having a stellar weekend.

**~~Fox Lab Leaf60, WKL Layout, Polycarbonate - $299 (case only) / $379 (no plate) / $399 (fully built) / $399 (new PCB / E-white aluminum plate) / $449 (new PCB / brass plate)~~ SOLD** 
-

This comes with the original box, polycarbonate case, sandblasted brass weight, a *brand-new* solderable PCB (never soldered), and brass plate. Alternatively, I can ship it with a fully built PCB with polycarbonate plate and gateron milky yellows for the same price -- just figured most people would prefer to build it themselves. This build sounds amazing by the way.

The condition is fair; there are some minor markings / scuffings on the polycarbonate finish. There is a small patch of abrasion on the bottom (like a brush), but mostly a non-issue as it is on the bottom. 

I don't want to let this board go in particular since it's a pleasure to type on and sounds incredible, but I would like to clear room for new stuff.

In the end, I am looking for **$399 for the Leaf60 w/ milky yellows and polycarbonate plate**, or I am looking for **$449 for the Leaf60 w/ new PCB and brass plate**. Alternatively, if you'd like to have a plate cut yourself and don't need a plate, I can do **$379 for the Leaf60 w/ new PCB and no plate.** Plate files are available online, so if you could find someone to cut a plate for you that would be a good opportunity. I had a POM plate cut for $30.

 **ALSO OFFERING TO SELL THE CASE $299. [Check this post out if you'd like to try a perkey RGB and underglow PCB with CF plate](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/eh3igr/cnhsa_128k_pssymbiosis_r2_60/) -- no guarantees**.

**~~Planck rev 6.1 Build (read) - $160~~ SOLD**
-

Looking to sell this as a full build only. I will break down my pricing at the end of this section.

I have a Planck here built with Gateron Black inks (desoldered, lubed w/ 205g0 and filmed with TX films). Everything works perfectly, however I accidentally lifted one of the RGB LED pads while desoldering a few of the WS2812B LEDs that I had previously installed. In other words, this Planck has underglow on one side only and I don't feel like desoldering the remaining LEDs. That being said it's a non-issue as the LEDs are not visible in the hi-pro case. And also you can't add full underglow LEDs anymore unless you are willing to bridge the connection.

So here is my 'breakdown':

- Planck rev6.1 PCB (with its issues) - $30

- Hi-Pro Mod case (black) - $35

- Hi-Pro Plate (black) - $10

- Gateron Black Inks (47 ct, lubed w/ 205g0, filmed, desoldered) - $35

- GMK Screw-in Stabilizer (2u, lubed, clipped) - $3

- XDA 40v2 Keycaps - $30

- MKUltra Planck Plate foam / case foam - $17

**Total: $160 + shipping**

All in all, you get a fully built Planck with clean sound (these switches thock so clean and deep with this case). Downside is that you won't be able to add full underglow later, and the case is in so-so condition ([see here for case condition](https://imgur.com/a/XJY97bT)). Apart from LEDs, it works perfectly.

Hello there! Starting my spring cleaning early this year, hence want to sell and/or trade a bunch of items that I do not like or do not have much use for.

Before getting into it, a couple of notes:

1.	**I did my best to specify a fair price for each and every item**. All of the below items are sold for about the same price I spent to acquire them (including shipping of course). I do not want to be a dick so if you feel that some prices below are inflated - definitely let me know.
2.	I can trade all the items below but some of them I won't sell for $money$
3.	Not FCFS, bundles, local buyers and EU buyers are preferred
4.	Bundles of 200€ or more (in total) get a free worldwide shipping

4.	Any MX HHKB keyboards that are not integrated plate
5.	Any keysets that cover MX HHKB layout (tsangan bottom row, split backspace, caps lock with ""control"" legend)

Today's menu: (shipping is not included, timestamps and extra pics above)

|Item|Description|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|
|TR60 keyboard (hot swap, no caps, no switches)|Space gray, comes with a hot swap Type-C PCB with a per-switch LEDs. GMK stabs lubed with dielectric grease and silicone grease (clipped and band aided). Brass back weight + 2 spare acrylic back plates. Partially silenced with a high density foam (bottom part of a case, about 50% of total area). Integrated plate 4mm, some anodization imperfections on a bottom (see pics).|150€ OBO or trades|
|KPRepublic HHKB case V1 (built, no caps)|Budget build I did a while ago. Types like a dream for people who love soft bottom out but has cosmetic imperfections. Built with Cherry MX Blacks (retooled), switches lubed with Christo-Lube MSG111, stabs are original GMK (clipped, band aided, lubed with dielectric + silicone grease). MKUltra foam in between plate and a PCB, which is DZ60 with RGB underglow. Bottom of a case is acrylic for your RGB to shine. This is top mount but a mount is a bit weird, it has no support on the sides which makes mods extra soft. Still feels very good. Cosmetic imperfections: 3 spots on a bottom part of a top part of a case, anadozation just wiped off (see pics). Tolerances between a top case and a place where caps are mounted are not that great thus expect gaps. [Extra pics](https://imgur.com/a/XUlK9FW/) (these are pre anodization blemishes, full build). |80€ OBO or trades (this case alone goes for around 75€ on AliExpress, though that one is V2)|
|~~Rama Heavy Industry R2~~|~~Looks and feels like ePBT (probably because it is ePBT). Scarcely used for about a week, only HHKB part of caps. Do not like a font hence selling. Comes in an original box. Not shipping in a bag.~~|~~90€ OBO or trades~~ **SOLD** |
|~~Cheap MX HHKB PBT blanks keyset from AliExpress~~|~~See pics, not much to say about this one. Used for about a week or so. Shipped in a bag.~~|~~15€ OBO or trades~~ **SOLD**|
|Kailh Box Navy x60 stock|Thicc clicc thocc. Used for a week scarcely. As new.|20€ OBO or trades|
|~~Aliaz Silent Tactile 60g x65 stock, 1 lubed with Christo-Lube MSG111 (for testing purposes)~~|~~Not used apart from 1 switch that was lubed. Do not like them much.~~|~~25€ OBO or trades~~ **SOLD**|
|~~Unholy Pandas x60 stock~~|~~By product of holy pandas. Stock (halo true spring), not used.~~|~~15€ OBO or trades~~ **SOLD**|
|YOK Holy Trash Pandas x60, lubed with Christo-Lube MSG111|Used scarcely for about a month in total. Lubed with care.|90€ OBO or trades|
|Topre artisan and regular blanks grab bag 26 pcs (see pics, all apart from 3 artisan caps in a bottom right part of a box)|These were gathered throughout the last year. All Topre, sorted in a box by a row (more or less).|80€ OBO or trades (feel free to abuse me to get the price down, I'm not sure what are they worth).|
|KeyForge Shishi Sticky Grape (Purge sale 2019)|MX stem. New never mounted. Shipped in a KeyForge bag.|80€ OBO or trades|
|KeyForge Mulder V3 Sakura (Purge sale 2019)|MX stem. New never mounted. Shipped in a KeyForge bag.|80€ OBO or trades|
|KeyForge Orochi  Lord of Saliva (Purge sale 2019)|MX stem. New never mounted. Shipped without a KeyForge bag.|80€ OBO or trades|
|BroCaps BroBot: Defender Class (Corrupted) TMX|TMX stem. Comes with a Tru-Bro ID card.|80€ OBO or trades (again, not sure how much I should charge for this one so feel free to roast me)|

Thanks for looking and hope you're having a stellar weekend.

[timestamp](http://imgur.com/a/4UrHHAi)

I have a GMK Laser Cyberdeck keycap set. I'm mainly looking to trade it for artisans and perhaps more money on top - if need be. 

However, if you absolutely want to buy the keycaps and not trade, then I'll let them go for $200 shipped to CONUS ONLY. They will be shipped in bags, unless you pay $5 more so I can get a dang box to fit these annoyingly massive trays. 

The keycaps have shine. I have posted pictures to show the shine as best as I can. If you're not okay with shine, then don't trade or buy this set. 

The list of artisans I am interested are; 

-Latrialum Imperial Destruction or Imperial Devastation esc and/or WASD (gamer keys) set
-Latrialum Royal Frenzy Esc and/or arrow keys set
-Latrialum Nightwalkers Beastlord
-Bongo Cats (Luna, Diana, Wolf, Poro and I may be interested in others)
-ArtKey Psychedelic 4 Monsters Amu, Raiju, and/or blank 

As mentioned above, depending on which artisans you have to offer, I may put more money on top or you may be required to offer more money. 

Thank You, peace. 👽

[TIMESTAMP](https://imgur.com/X1sDf0m)

SOLD! 


I have a mint condition DOLCH .CR Keyboard in MINT CONDITION. It was brand new when I purchased it a few months ago and is not getting the attention it deserves. In total, I used for less than 2 hours.

* Comes with all you see in the picture minus the keycaps(GMK Calm Depths) and switches(67g Aqua Zilents lubed with Trybosis 3203)
   * 1 Hot Swap PCB with daughter board (currently in the board)
   * 1 Brand New solderable PCB with daughter board
   * Gold front insert (not on the board). White insert is on now.
   * Polycarb back insert (not on the board). Gold insert is on now.
   * Beautiful carrying case
   * DOLCH Keycap.
* I am not very sure of what the pricing is on this as they are rare to see on MM, but I will put it up for **$500 Shipped.**
* For **$620** I am willing to include the switches on the board plus extra from when I bought them from Zeal - Around 90 total and the full base kit of calm depths with or without cardboard sleeve (+$10).
   * Switches and keycaps are virtually brand new. ZERO shine on the caps.
* The switches and Calm Depths kit retails for much more than the extra I am asking.
* Please let me know if you'd like more pictures or have any questions and I am **open to negotiation**.

Shipping is to the continental United States only, sorry for the inconvenience

------------------------

 SOLD Unholy panda leftovers. These are made with halo true housings and the 100g spring they came with and the stem from the yok tactile trash pandas. Looking for $25 shipped for 70 switches, or $24 for 69, and will sell or trade oddball quantities upon request.

Apple Standard Keyboard with Salmon Alps: This board is for the most part in really good condition. The switches absolutely could use a cleaning though. It has two issues: First, the lock switch for caps lock does not stay locked down. Second, it is somehow missing the stabilizer on the enter key. This makes pressing it anywhere but over the switch not really doable. The good things are that all of the caps are in very good condition (no cracked or broken stems), but the ABS space bar is heavily shined and completely smooth from use. The case would look excellent if someone were to use that vintage electronic cleaner on it (it's reasonably yellowed). No dings, cracks, or any major issues. The rainbow Apple logo is in perfect condition. I initially bought this board to take the alps switches out of it, I would feel wrong destroying it just for the switches. It would make a great resto-mod. I will provide any pictures you could ask for of it, inside and out if you are seriously interested! Looking for $50 shipped.

DSA Drifter Drifter Alphas and Base Mods: I bought this set off another mechmarket user because I needed a ortho compatibility kit that he was selling along with it. I have never used it and it has just been sitting in a drawer since I purchased it. Looking for $220 shipped, also go buy KAT Drifter, just saying

Trades interested in:

Switches, especially holy panda clones like t1,s everglide oreos, etc. Linears are cool too, really anything

Condition of the KBD75v2 is pretty much how it came from KBDFans, no exterior scratches or streaking marks (The anodised finish is very good). However I am only selling the KBD75v2 pre-built meaning that if you want to swap switches or stabilisers, you will have to de-solder yourself.
