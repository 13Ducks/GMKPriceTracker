**Noxary PC 268.2 R1**

Unused. Includes the case, brass weight, two PCBs, a 1.5mm brass plate, and a 1.5mm PC plate.

So, this was sold to me as A-Stock, but upon closer inspection, there are a couple of marks and spots on the case. Top right corner, there is a faint black line. On the bottom left, there is a small black splotch. Across the bottom, there are a couple of marks as well. You can compare the closeup shots with the full body shots, and you'll see that the marks are barely visible unless you are looking very closely.

Given the slight flaws, I've dropped the price to just below the B-Stock prices. I think it's a fair price but if you disagree shoot me a message and we can work something out.

**Planck rev 6.1 Build (read) - $160**
-

Looking to sell this as a full build only. I will break down my pricing at the end of this section.

I have a Planck here built with Gateron Black inks (desoldered, lubed w/ 205g0 and filmed with TX films). Everything works perfectly, however I accidentally lifted one of the RGB LED pads while desoldering a few of the WS2812B LEDs that I had previously installed. In other words, this Planck has underglow on one side only and I don't feel like desoldering the remaining LEDs. That being said it's a non-issue as the LEDs are not visible in the hi-pro case. And also you can't add full underglow LEDs anymore unless you are willing to bridge the connection.

So here is my 'breakdown':

- Planck rev6.1 PCB (with its issues) - $30

- Hi-Pro Mod case (black) - $35

- Hi-Pro Plate (black) - $10

- Gateron Black Inks (47 ct, lubed w/ 205g0, filmed, desoldered) - $35

- GMK Screw-in Stabilizer (2u, lubed, clipped) - $3

- XDA 40v2 Keycaps - $30

- MKUltra Planck Plate foam / case foam - $17

**Total: $160 + shipping**

All in all, you get a fully built Planck with amazing sound (these switches thock so clean and deep with this case). Downside is that you won't be able to add full underglow later, and the case is in so-so condition ([see here for case condition](https://imgur.com/a/XJY97bT)). Apart from LEDs, it works perfectly. 

**~~DSA Eve - $47~~ SOLD**

**ePBT Extended 2048 (base kit, icono kit, intl kit)**

Not splitting kits. Barely used, so no shine whatsoever and in perfect condition. Mainly looking for trades, but open to all offers. Tried selling it a week ago but due to a conflict I was unable to ship out; so I am fine taking it very slowly with this set (no rush)."

Hi everyone.

I’m looking to purchase a Matrix 1.2, Mira SE, and a Duck blackbird pcb.

I will significantly  overpay for a blackbird pcb so please contact me if you have one.

Looking to sell a brand new never used Dygma Raise keyboard kit.  I opened the package to test and make sure it operated 100% and then put it back in its custom carrying case.
It’s a split keyboard design with magnets that hold it together when assembled together. 
It is hotswappable and has amazing underglow as well as in switch lighting that is all customizable. 

It comes with the caps pictured and speed copper switches.
Also comes with its custom carrying case. 

Looking to get $200 for it which is a great deal less than retail. SOLD!!!!

Selling these off because TKLs are unfortunately the most boring layout for me. These just collect dust on the shelf. I'd rather just pick up more audio gear.

Prices are set without considering keycaps prices. These will also be shipping *with* the keycaps currently on. The remainder of the keyset will not be shipped with it because I am too lazy to fish them out from my storage.

If you live in NYC, I can do a local trade.

This was the first keyboard I put together that I was really happy with, but I have new boards and this one is gathering dust. The full rundown:

* Tron 60 Black aluminum case from [KPrepublic](https://kprepublic.com/products/tron-60-anodized-aluminium-acclive-angle-case-for-custom-mechanical-keyboard-black-siver-tiffany-purple-red-for-gh60-xd60-xd64?_pos=1&_sid=37e08843a&_ss=r). I have not seen these anywhere on mm or in stock since I got it. Has acrylic glow layer and a ""half-profile"" height.
* Hotswap ANSI PCB with underglow, plus brushed brass plate from [1upkeyboards](https://www.1upkeyboards.com/shop/parts-and-tools/parts/diy-60-ansi-plate-kit/)
* Switches are Zealio v1 stems in MX Clear housings. I was really into heavy springs and really sensitive to wobble so I made these. They are unlubed. I can answer more questions about these in the pms.
* GMK Screw-in Stabs, lubed. No rattle on anything.
* SA Pulse R3 keyset, alphas and text mods (all will be included, not just what's mounted)

I feel like this might appeal to a small number of people but thought I'd give it a shot. Asking $300 shipped CONUS. I am interested in any blue/ocean themed SA or KAT keysets for trade, as well as alpaca linear switches. I would consider splitting the case or the keycaps. Thanks for looking!"

Got a couple of keyboards for sale here to shave down my collection as I'm moving away from the 60% form factor. I'm located in Singapore and am looking for Paypal only. I will eat paypal fees for all transactions. Prices include shipping internationally via DHL express international, to Paypal confirmed addresses.

Buyers from Singapore please PM for local prices.

As per MM etiquette, please leave a comment at the bottom with ""PM"" before dropping me a line. Will try to reply ASAP but I'm on GMT+8 so replies might be slightly delayed.

Thank you for your time!

**Built TX60 ANSI Silver (USD450 shipped international)**

Detailed Pics: [https://imgur.com/a/epdwiMy](https://imgur.com/a/epdwiMy)

Board has been built with Cherry Retooled Blacks (lubed with 3204 and spring swapped to 65g GON springs) with GMK screw-in stabilizers on a DZ60 PCB and brass plate. There are some usual oxidisation marks on the brass weight (please see pictures) . Case itself is in lovely condition. Please note that there are also some marks on the brass plate as well from a previous desolder job.

**Brand New Noxary T60 R2 Silver (USD320 shipped international)**

Detailed Pics: [https://imgur.com/a/e77axsv](https://imgur.com/a/e77axsv)

Meant to be a project for a flex build but I moved on from the 60% form factor since I need a bigger board for work. Comes with Mekanisk WT60D VIA compatible PCB, a flexy polycarb plate, MK Ultra case foam and the usual screws and rubber feet. Will also throw in a free set of 60% GMK pre-retooled screw-in stabilizers for 6.25U Spacebar. Kit has never been built.

* Emerald Espectro by mechkeys.ca with BOX whites -- $200
    * The Espectro is a great board, I just never used it after I built it as it was just a little too big for my personal preference. There are a few minor ""issues"" with it, the biggest one is that there are cracks near the screw holes of the polycarbonate bottom in 4 locations (pictures in album) but they do not affect the stability of the bottom nor do you see them at all when the board is on a desk. The other issue would only be noticed if you end up changing the switches as the tolerance for the plate to mount into the case are too tight and some of the anodization has come off because of how hard you have to wedge the plate in, this doesn't effect where the plate sits or anything but just something to note if you plan on changing switches or plates on it.
* Red Sentraq S60-X with Kailh Copper -- $55
    * This was my first true mechanical keyboard and has seen a good amount of love but now it is time for it to have a new home, there are a few rgb underglow leds that do not work and the bottom is stickerbombed slightly but it is still sturdy. Great first board!
* ~~Let's Split 40% with Tealios~~ -- $65 (SOLD)
    * This is an early version of the Let's Split with a black acrylic sandwich case. It has unlubed Zeal Tealios on it and a custom TRRS cable from Zap Cables. This is a fun little board and has the standard layout installed. 
* Daisy 40% with Custom Linear Switches -- $150 (with switches) / $95 (without switches)
    * This is a silver aluminum with RGB underglow Daisy 40% running the default firmware in a split spacebar layout, the case is in good condition and has front fold-able legs to give either an angle or flat typing experience.
    *The switches are a combination of 3 different switches and is the reason the price is so high with them, they are cherry silent black stems with gateron yellow springs in a zealios housing. They are super smooth even unlubed and are a joy to type on. I don't use the board that much so I am selling with the switches on.
* ~~GMK Mondorian -- $40~~ (SOLD)
    * No use but did sit on a keyboard for some time, I just could not get into the ortholinear boards that it is designed for and never learned the boards enough to utilize the blank without worry. They are very clean looking on a board though.
* SA NightKing -- $115
    *Very little use, no shine, full kit. I just don't use SA enough to justify keeping this, I love the colors but also don't have a board that it looks good on.

Hi!

As the title suggest, I'm trying to sell my gmmk compact as a full build. I bought the barebones board off a user from /r hardwareswap about 5 months ago but have been using it on and off for about 2 months. It was mainly used as a test board for switches. It is fully functional and doesn't have any defects. The build comes with gateron browns (lubed w/ 3203) and gmk plate mount stabs from novelkeys (clipped, band aid modded, and lubed with 205g0). I can also include ymdk pudding keycaps and the remaining browns (not lubed) for free if you want. It also comes with the original box, keycap puller, red ASCEND keycap, and cable. This is not **FCFS!** I want to prioritize local buyers as dealing with shipping is such a pain. Local is **91776** but willing to meet up in the LA or Fullerton area for pick up. Please comment below before pm'ing me (not through reddit chat). **Price is negotiable!**

**GMMK compact build - $70 shipped**

* gateron browns (lubed w/ 3203)

Got a couple of keyboards for sale here to shave down my collection as I'm moving away from the 60% form factor. I'm located in Singapore and am looking for Paypal only. I will eat paypal fees for all transactions. Prices include shipping internationally via DHL express international, to Paypal confirmed addresses.

Buyers from Singapore please PM for local prices.

As per MM etiquette, please leave a comment at the bottom with ""PM"" before dropping me a line. Will try to reply ASAP but I'm on GMT+8 so replies might be slightly delayed.

Thank you for your time!

**Built TX60 ANSI Silver (USD450 shipped international)**

Detailed Pics: [https://imgur.com/a/epdwiMy](https://imgur.com/a/epdwiMy)

Board has been built with Cherry Retooled Blacks (lubed with 3204 and spring swapped to 65g GON springs) with GMK screw-in stabilizers on a DZ60 PCB and brass plate. There are some usual oxidisation marks on the brass weight (please see pictures) . Case is in lovely condition. Please note that there are also some marks on the brass plate as well from a previous desolder job.

&#x200B;

**Noxary T60r2 Silver (USD320 shipped international)**

Detailed Pics: [https://imgur.com/a/e77axsv](https://imgur.com/a/e77axsv)

Just received this case a couple of days ago. Meant to be a project for a flex build but I moved on from the 60% form factor since I need a bigger board for work. Comes with Mekanisk WT60D VIA compatible PCB, a flexy polycarb plate, MK Ultra case foam and the usual screws and rubber feet. Will also throw in a free set of 60% GMK pre-retooled screw-in stabilizers for 6.25U Spacebar. Kit has never been built.

Also just received this a couple of days ago. Was supposed to be for a build but then moved on from the 60% form factor. Can be bundled with the Noxary T60r2 above for a better deal, please check through PM."

Hi everyone and happy lunar new year, got some goodies up for trade/sale today.

~~First up is GMK DMG R1 Base + Spacebars. I got this for a board for use and I ended up selling the board to a friend. Keycaps have not been mounted or used since I received them and are in pristine condition. Looking for less than what I paid for them: $220 + shipping.~~ **SOLD**

~~Second up is the TGR Alice in gray. This board is fantastic and types like a dream. That being said, I can't get used to the layout over something more comfortable like a traditional 60%/TKL. This board will come unbuilt as a kit with brass plate and cleanly desoldered PK PCB. I'm putting this up to fish out any trades for a **silver LZ CLS** plus PayPal on your end. The silver LZ CLS is the board that I'd like the most but I will consider other trade offers.~~ **TRADED**

Lastly, I'd like to see if anyone would be willing to sell OG dyesubs from various cherry boards. They don't have to be NIB or anything, I'm just looking for a quality set of OG dyesubs that I can use on future boards.

As tradition dictates, comment before PM. Please no reddit chat, I will not answer that. 

Thanks for stopping by, and have a great (lunar) new year!"

I might have band-aid modded the stabilizers, but I cannot remember and I don't want to take it apart. Part of the USB cable slips off, but it isn't an issue in practice and a dab of glue would secure it.

I had to push the PCB into place as described on the [Rama Support Website](https://rama.works/m60a-keys-not-registering), but once it was pushed in all of the keys registered.

The bottom of some key caps have chips in them, I did not use most if any of them so I assume they were from the manufacturing or the previous seller whilst removing keycaps. A picture to show is on the time stamp. I do not see any chips on the side or tops of the keycaps.

The keycap is beautiful and very well made. Used rarely as it was on my ""CALC"" key on my board. The keycap does fit loosely so I used saran wrap and it worked great. A picture is attached but the saran wrap was removed after the picture.

These will be shipped out in bags, not trays. (The trays are just for showing off the keycaps and will not be included.)

Light use, with little to no shine. I've only mounted the caps on a TKL, so a lot of keys remain unused.

The reflected lighting in the pictures may overemphasize or create the illusion of shine.

Selling as a bundle only; no splitting up Base and Blue Alphas.

$280

&#x200B;

**~~GMK Oblivion V2 Hagoromo Alphas~~** ~~- Brand new. -~~ [~~pic1~~](https://imgur.com/JvWrF1j)

~~Some of the caps have shifted in the tray during shipping, and there is a small tear in the plastic where I tried to move the caps to their original spot (by pushing the caps above the plastic seal). That attempt failed, and I'm leaving the packaging alone, lest I worsen the tear lol. I wore nitrile gloves throughout this whole process, so caps should be perfectly safe.~~

~~Long story short, the caps are basically brand new and unused.~~

I am selling my R1 GMK Hyperfuse set with many extras. Hyperfuse was my endgame set until recently and I gathered as many matching kits as possible:

* GMK Hyperfuse R1
* Hyperfuse Accent kit from Originative
* Hyperfuse Cyan (TU2) Spacebar kit (6.25u & 7u) from Originative
* Hyperfuse Matching (2M) 6u off-center Spacebar from Originative
* OG GMK Spacekeys (CC keys only) - these match the gray mods perfectly
* Matching (DY base & TU2 Legend) purple ""heck"" key

No noticeable shine or wear, the set only has about 3 months of intermediate use between the previous owner and myself, I used this set in rotation with about 3 others so call it 1.5 months of actual use total.

**SOLD for $225 for everything.**

Free Shipping within CONUS - $25 International Shipping

**GMK Space Cadet Base and Blue Alphas** \- [pic1](https://imgur.com/4H47lZN), [pic2](https://imgur.com/4H47lZN)

See pics for what is included. These will be shipped out in bags, not trays. (Sorry, the pictured trays are just for showing off the keycaps.)

Light use, with little to no shine. I've only used the caps on a TKL, so a lot of keys remain unused.

The reflected lighting in the pictures may overemphasize or create the illusion of shine.

Selling as a bundle only; no splitting up Base and Blue Alphas.

$280

&#x200B;

**GMK Oblivion V2 Hagoromo Alphas** \- Brand new sealed.

Some of the caps have shifted in the tray, and there is a small tear in the plastic where I tried to put the caps in their original spot. That attempt failed, and I'm leaving the packaging alone, lest I worsen the tear lol.

Long story short, the caps are basically brand new unused.

**Singa X TGR Unikorn** $800 shipped fully insured /$750 local pickup (Los Angeles) OBO

A-stock Velvet case and A-stock weight. The case itself has 0 exterior defects and is perfect, no visible anodization or physical defects. The interior has 3 defects, please check the timestamp album to view them. The weight has 0 defects to it, aside from that haze cloud visible in the timestamp. It is removable if you polish the weight, alternatively from what I read online and asked around on MK discords is you could use acetone (nail polish) to wipe it off . If you use acetone to wipe the weight it will retain its sandblasted look, again that's just from what I read online. DISCLAIMER, if you polish the weight or do the acetone method I take absolutely 0 responsibility to what happens , please do your own research and assume my information to be just word of mouth info from people. I take zero responsibility for whatever you decide to do to the weight be it positive or negative and am being upfront about it as best to my knowledge.

The kit includes the following items in new never used condition

-1 A-stock Velvet Unikorn case & brass weight

-1 TGR 60 pcb and I've plugged it in and tested the pins with tweezers to ensure all the keys register, and they all do.

-1 TGR brass plate

-1 Kbdfans 60% half plate, aluminum and in gray

-1 Original gasket ring

-4 original rubber feet, 1 for each corner

No switches or keycaps are included, just what is listed for the kit

Will be shipped in original Singa packing box and packing materials

**ca66 brass plate** $40 shipped OBO

Spare plate that I had for my ca66, not really planning to ever build it with this plate so I'd rather let it go. It's brand new and unused, is a r2 brass plate as seen with the larger space bar cutout.

**Build:**

So the board has some scratches and defects in the escape corner and the spacebar edge. None of which you will see when in use with keycaps. The bottom is pretty much flawless. The board, otherwise, sounds great when typing and feels wonderful too.

Acrylic Alice from /uaknyang in blue (DOES NOT INCLUDE PCB OR SWITCHES) | Awesome board, just haven't touched it since I got a rukia. Blue matches striker pretty well imo. There are some scuffs particularly around the left side of the board where my palm was. The paint wore off due to the friction of my hand when i was playing games on it. Would be an ez fix as it just needs a new coat of paint. Comes with a 5mm acrylic integrated plate which detached just on the top right corner, just needs a bit of acrylic glue to fix, but perfectly usable as is. Comes with 2 bases: a 6 degree frosted base and a 10-15? degree clear base. | $130 or $10 less with striker set. | *yes*

Hey r/mechmarket!

I have some boards and artisans for sale. Thank you for taking the time to look through my post and pictures.

1. Prototype Board ( VNMK Freyr) -This is a prototype board, only issues are with the plate and a tiny scratch on the inside of the case near the space bar left stab. Pictures in time stamp. My friend took a dremel to the space bar stabs so the wire doesn't hit the plate. Looks a little ugly but with key caps on is unnoticeable and functional. 5 leds are not working. I don't know why but they are 1.8mm red leds. The board is built with Gateron Ink Blacks lubed with 205 G0.  Zeal stabs lubed with 205G0. Neoprene was added to the board as well. Sounds great.  Price $330 shipped in the conus. PENDING
2. Keyboardbelle PLA75- Translucent top and bottom. Gasket mount board. Comes with extra top in game cartridge gray. Never built, brand new. Price $230 shipped in Conus SOLD
3. KBD75V1- This is the first KBD75, it comes with two PCBs. They both have millmax sockets installed. one has the 7305 and the other has the different finish sockets. I did not get the sockets on GB and paid for it lol. So, the downside is the first version pcb has an issue with the fn, So I remapped it over and no issues but then dealing with the underglow on the 1st pcb is finnicky and wants to not work at times. So, I bought the v2 pcb and installed millmax on that and no issues what soever. So, 1 pcb fn issues and the other is flawless. Comes with Gmk stabs. Price is $160 shipped in Conus  SOLD
4. Artisans- All Keybutos are $70 each shipped.( Nightfarer lion SOLD)  CYO set of 4 for $200 shipped. Sticky Grape Orochi $70 shipped. Ko Lucky cats are $50 shipped. Patriarch is $60 shipped. Enos23 $20 shipped. Cherep $20 shipped. Otto $20 shipped. All Conus.

|Purple Heart Tada68 Case - I had this case custom made. Case is in good condition, but does have imperfections as  it was handmade by a fellow user on reddit. One of the brass inserts for the screws worked itself out a bit, but I fixed it by gently hammering it back in. I did have issues with keys rubbing against the case near the right edge of the blocker and above the backspace key - this can be easily remedied with some sandpaper or carefully dremeling those areas. I also added green powder coated feet and rubber bumpers to the bottom of the case to make it more stable.|$80 shipped conus|Yes|

M65-A in Hydro blue w/ Nylon Base, built with Gateron Silent Ink switches on a polished brass plate (will include the original hydro blue plate), stabilizers are clipped and lubed. PCB was swapped a couple months back for a USB-C option from KBDFans (still has the underflow). I will include GMK Striker in select trades seeing as I don't have any other boards that that set will look good on.

&#x200B;

As far as trades are concerned I'm mainly looking for boards between 65% and 80%

Looking for $550 for the board itself or $650-ish if you also want GMK Striker"

Hey there y'all, got some stuff that I have sitting around and would prefer they go of use rather than just sit around in my drawers.

Any questions please feel free to message me and I'll try to answer them as best as I can. Thanks. 

**Singa X TGR Unikorn** $850 shipped USPS Priority fully insured CONUS/$790 local pickup (Los Angeles) OBO 

A-stock Velvet case and A-stock weight. The case itself has 0 exterior defects and is perfect, no visible anodization or physical defects. The interior has 3 defects, please check the timestamp album to view them. The weight has 0 defects to it, aside from that haze cloud visible in the timestamp. It is removable if you polish the weight, alternatively from what I read online and asked around on MK discords is you could use acetone (nail polish) to wipe it off . If you use acetone to wipe the weight it will retain its sandblasted look, again that's just from what I read online. **DISCLAIMER**, if you polish the weight or do the acetone method I take absolutely 0 responsibility to what happens , please do your own research and assume my information to be just word of mouth info from people. I take zero responsibility for whatever you decide to do to the weight be it positive or negative and am being upfront about it as best to my knowledge. 

The kit includes the following items in new never used condition

-1 A-stock Velvet Unikorn case & brass weight

-1 TGR 60 pcb and I've plugged it in and tested the pins with tweezers to ensure all the keys register, and they all do.

-1 TGR brass plate

-1 Kbdfans 60% half plate, aluminum and in gray

-1 Original gasket ring

-4 original rubber feet, 1 for each corner

No switches or keycaps are included, just what is listed for the kit

Will be shipped in original Singa packing box and packing materials

**Build:** 

* 67g Aqua Zilents with Tribosys 3204
* Zeal Stabs with 205g0 
* 5 mm Brass Plate 

So the board has some scratches and defects in the escape corner and the spacebar edge. None of which you will see when in use with keycaps. The bottom is pretty much flawless. The board, otherwise, sounds great when typing and feels wonderful too.

**Used Black Tofu** \- This was my first build. Used for \~2 months. **The screw holes are a bit damaged. I sanded down the lower right post to reduce inconsistency for the spacebar. Also, just saying but from my experience, screwing in the middle post made a ping sound for the keys in the middle area.** I have a piece of shelf liner for the cutout in it, and on top of that the mkultra foam. Looking for **$70 shipped and $77 with the dampeners. As a bundle, I am asking $120 or $127 shipped. - SOLD

**Hotswap Ansi DZ60** \- Used in the Tofu above. **Showing separately because I have had a couple problems with the sockets not working, mainly being the \\ key and barely ever the h key. The two contacts have been pushed too far apart so it could probably be fixed.** And obviously it can be fixed by placing a new socket in, but I just don't care enough about it anymore. It is built with retooled blacks lubed with 205g0. Gmk screw ins also lubed with 205g0. Keep in mind this was used for around 2 months. Black Aluminum plate. Looking for **$60 shipped for everything**. We can also negociate prices for just switches and or plate.

Lastly, I don't think anyone buying does but I'd also be kind of interested in h87a linear builds."

GMK 40s/split | In good condition, some slight shine on 2.25 space bar. | $40 | *yes*
Acrylic Alice from /uaknyang in blue (DOES NOT INCLUDE PCB OR SWITCHES) | Awesome board, just haven't touched it since I got a rukia. Blue matches striker pretty well imo. There are some scuffs particularly around the left side of the board where my palm was. The paint wore off due to the friction of my hand when i was playing games on it. Would be an ez fix as it just needs a new coat of paint. Comes with a 5mm acrylic integrated plate which detached just on the top right corner, just needs a bit of acrylic glue to fix, but perfectly usable as is. Comes with 2 bases: a 6 degree frosted base and a 10-15? degree clear base. | $130 or $10 less with striker set. | *yes*
Epbt 2048 numpad, international, nav | Never used or mounted. Willing to split this set. | $40 for both, $30 for international, $15 for nav | *yes*

Gotta let go of the keeb because priorities. Built with KBD Fans T1 switches on a brass plate, on top of a renewed HS60 v2 PCB (missing diode, but got repaired and it's working flawlessly) which is hot-swappable and compatible with the amazing VIA software (basically a GUI for configuring QMK layers that works immediately insted of waiting for a flash). Lined with a layer of sorbothane for sound dampening, and built with genuine GMK screw-in stabilizers.

~~**GMK Minimal $220**~~ sold asking

Just the base. Set used minimally for 2 weeks, some caps might be a little dirty but nothing a quick wipe wouldn't fix. Should be little shine if any.

~~**GMK Red Samurai $90**~~ sold asking

1800 set from Drop. Essentially new, set only mounted and used for a few quick typing tests. 

---------

**GMMK Compact with 62g Zealios $140**

Good condition, no clear defects. Used lightly for a few months.

Switches are lubed with 3204 and filmed. Springs were bag lubed. Spacebar switch is a Tealios.

Stabilizers are lubed with dielectric grease and teflon. Some stabs might benefit from a relube.

It's the updated edition with the foam and weights inside. Comes in original box, and also includes the cable and other tools it comes with.

Keycaps are the PBT Aura ones that GMMK sells, caps have some wear but nothing damaging."

**Built TX60 ANSI Silver (USD450 shipped international)**

Board has been built with Cherry Retooled Blacks (lubed with 3204 and spring swapped to 65g GON springs) with GMK screw-in stabilizers on a DZ60 PCB and brass plate. There are some usual oxidisation marks on the brass weight (please see pictures) . Case is in lovely condition. Please note that there are also some marks on the brass plate as well from a previous desolder job.

**Noxary T60r2 Silver (USD320 shipped international)**

Just received this case a couple of days ago. Meant to be a project for a flex build but I moved on from the 60% form factor since I need a bigger board for work. Comes with Mekanisk WT60D VIA compatible PCB, a flexy polycarb plate, MK Ultra case foam and the usual screws and rubber feet. Will also throw in a free set of 60% GMK pre-retooled screw-in stabilizers for 6.25U Spacebar. Kit has never been built.

Hi all,

Cleaning house on a couple of MX related items as I've switched over to Topre recently. Not looking for trades. Also, only offering continental US shipping at the moment. Please comment before PMing. Please be patient with me as I’m working late now a days so I will get invoices out if you provided your PayPal by night time PST. Thanks!

Thank you.

~~**Aluminum YMDK WASD v2 TKL with 67g v2 Zilents (keycaps not included) | $220 Shipped OBO**~~ **SOLD**

Custom project board that I made from an MX Blue WASD v2 TKL. Originally intended on making this my daily driver with the Classic Black keycaps, but I recently found myself really liking Topre so I've switched over. I've used this board very sparingly over the past 3 weeks or so and has since been sitting in storage. The board will be neatly wrapped in bubble wrap and will be shipped securely in a box.

&nbsp;

About the board:

- I desoldered the original MX blues myself and installed new 67g v2 Zilents which were lubed with Tribosys 3203. 

&nbsp;

- The board is housed in a brand new black YMDK aluminum TKL case (purchased from AliExpress) with shelf liner for insulation/sound dampening. Aluminum case is in like new condition. The case currently does not have the aluminum feet installed, but I will include them as well. I will also include the original WASD plastic keyboard case.

Hello, thank you for reading in advance!

EDIT: . **Already bought E6-V2, thanks. disregard this post and look at my recent**

~~I am currently looking to trade this board for an E6-V2, but I am also willing to sell. This is NOT FCFS, priority goes toward a trade for an E6-V2. As of now, I am not looking for another board.~~

This UNIKORN is a Purple ***B-STOCK*** from recent extras sale. I personally bought this from another /mm user so I paid the AFTERMARKET PRICE for this board. Only defect(s) are in the anodization... there are black spots on both sides of the board. The weight is also starting to tarnish a bit, but not an extreme amount, the centerpiece of the weight is flawless. There are absolutely no nicks, dents or scratches anywhere on the board.

***The board is currently built on the original TGR PCB with a alu plate, GMK Clip in Stabs lubed with 205g0 and well broken in 3203 lubed Nolives (Recolored creams) that were spring swapped to 62g SPRiT springs. The layout is TSANGAN (Split Backspace, Split Right Shift and a 7u Bottom Row). Everything was lubed and soldered by me, so If you have any questions just ask.***

Here is a short 30 second [typing test](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KtybZHxbzkhCIuv_qt6gqefJXKvulb65/view?usp=sharing) I took on Typings.gg at 132wpm and recorded with my phone with GMK DMG. Also, the typing test was recorded WITHOUT the screws, which is they way I recommend you use the board. The screws WILL be included as well.

***Along with the build, I have an extra WT60-D PCB with custom cuts to support the gasket and the original TGR Brass Plate. I will also be including a 60% TX Bag. The board will be wrapped in the original Singa paper followed by the TX Microfiber cloth.***

Price Breakdown: Fully Built Unikorn ($800) + WT60-D ($60) + TX Bag ($50)

**Total value with Extras SHIPPED: $900**

**Shipping is included within CONUS only, as I will NOT ship internationally in order to provide a quick and simple transaction, thanks for understanding.**

I am not ""flipping"" this board, as I said before I bought it in the aftermarket. I am simply trying to make back the money and time I spent on this board. If you look at my previous sales, nothing is ever overpriced or unreasonable. This board is one of the best sounding and feeling I have ever built and I know, along with the ad-ons is worth the asking price.

~~Again, I am not necessarily looking to sell but I will entertain any offers, really want to trade for an E6-V2+PayPal:~~

~~E6-V2: From any round (prefer R2), any plate material and any color is fine, as I can always cerakote. However, I would prefer dark colors, eg. Black or Navy.~~

~~The board can be fully built or unbuilt, all I ask is that you provide Two (2) or more PCBs.~~

***~~I AM NOT looking for the full brass FE board and I AM NOT looking for an HHKB layout.~~***

~~Please PM with proper timestamps and description of the board. Based on recent sales, the market price for an E6-v2 is  \~ $400-450. I am more than happy to value your board more than that if you meet all of my requirements. Custom nametags are NOT a dealbreaker, but could severely impact the value of your board. If you don't want to trade, I can simply buy the board from you if and only if this bundle sells, thanks.~~

Thanks again for reading, as always please comment before PM!"

Item | Description |   Price   |   Available
-------|-----------------|---------|---------
GMK Striker base + 40s/split | In good condition, some slight shine starting to happen on alphas. Not splitting this unless I have a buyer for both kits. | $180 shipped in tray (can ship with the acrylic alice for $10 less) | *yes*
Acrylic Alice from /u/aknyang in blue (does not include pcb) | Awesome board, just haven't touched it since I got a rukia. Blue matches striker pretty well imo. There are some scuffs particularly around the left side of the board where my palm was. The paint wore off due to the friction of my hand when i was playing games on it. Would be an ez fix as it just needs a new coat of paint. Comes with a 5mm acrylic integrated plate which also detached just on the top right corner, just needs a bit of acrylic glue to fix. Comes with 2 bases: a 6 degree frosted base and a 10-15? degree clear base. | $140 or $10 less with striker set. | *yes*
Epbt 2048 numpad, international, nav | Never used or mounted. Willing to split this set. | $40 for international + nav, ~~$30 for numpad~~, $30 for international, $15 for nav | *yes*

**~~GMK Mizu Sealed~~ - $220** - SOLD

Sealed. I dare not open them or I will keep them. Will ship in the box that Dixiemech shipped them in to me.

**~~Laplace 40% keyboard - $65~~** **- SOLD**

Built with Kailh Purple Tactile switches. This is an amazing board if you want to start getting into 40% boards. The Laplace has one extra column (13u wide instead of 12u wide) that allows it to use more standard keycap sets and retain punctuation keys on the base layout. Much easier to adapt to than 12u boards. **Add $10 if you want the pictured keycaps with it**.

**SA Nuclear Deskmat - $35**

Had this custom made to go with my SA Nuclear set. I sold my SA Nuclear set and no longer need this.

**~~Perry60 V2 - $55~~** **- SOLD**

**Cracked!** Look at the pictures. Two of the acrylic layers cracked in the front during shipping. **This keyboard is fully functional and next level smooth to type on**. Has **Gateron Red Inks (lubed by me, 105 on springs, 205 on slider)** and an XD60 underglow PCB.

If you are handy with solder pump consider this a bargain set of hand-lubed Red Inks :-)

Hey there y'all, I've been holding onto my unikorn for a while since I managed to snag one from the last sale. Ultimately decided to list it up for local trades and see what boards there are out there . My local zip code is 91770, and only really interested in trading it locally at the moment. As for trade items, I'm NOT interested in any artisan keycaps or any keycap sets of any kind . I AM interested in keyboards with alice style layouts , 65%, and WKL TKL boards. Feel free to pm me trade offers in regards to boards in those layouts, and depending on what's in the trade cash can be added on my side or yours. Without further ado , here are the boards listed and some information about them. 

**Singa X TGR Unikorn** Local trades 

A-stock Velvet case and A-stock weight. The case itself has 0 exterior defects and is basically perfect, without any visible anodization or physical defects. The interior has 3 defects, please check the timestamp album. The weight has 0 defects to it, aside from that haze cloud visible in the timestamp. It is removable if you polish the weight, alternatively from what I read online and asked around on MK discords is you could use acetone (nail polish) to wipe it off . DISCLAIMER, if you polish the weight or do the acetone method I take absolutely 0 responsibility to what happens , please do your own research and assume my information to be just word of mouth info from people. I take zero responsibility for whatever you decide to do to the weight be it positive or negative and am being upfront about it as best to my knowledge. 

The kit includes the following items in new never used condition

-1 A-stock Velvet Unikorn case & brass weight 

-1 TGR 60 pcb and I've plugged it in and tested the pins with tweezers to ensure all the keys register, and they 
all do. 

-1 TGR brass plate

-1 Kbdfans 60% half plate, aluminum and in gray 

-1 Original gasket ring 

-4 original rubber feet, 1 for each corner

- No switches or keycaps are included, just what is listed for the kit

~~Kbd19x $350 shipped CONUS/OBO~~ Sold for $320 local cash 

The following information is copy & pasted from my past post of this board, and the condition of the board is exactly the same since then. All it did was sit in the original box and bubble wrap since I swapped to a different layout. 

 Board has a handful of defects, please refer to the imgur album as I've noted the positions of where they are, luckily none are on the top. Board is built with gateron black inks, brushed lubed every single switch with gpl 205g0 (housing,stem, springs). Cerakote finish of pink champagne (H-311Q) the week it was released, aluminum weight has a cerakote finish of gold (H-122Q). Brass plate, gmk retooled screw in stabilizers tuned and lubed with gpl 205g0, screws has motherboard electric washers to prevent any risk of shorting the pcb. Acrylic strip has been sanded lightly to give it a frosted look, and to help the leds not blind through the clear acrylic. My potato camera sucks at capturing the actual real life color accuracy under better lighting , but the cerakote looks exactly like this irl ( https://www.cerakote.com/gallery/detail/53401/Cerakote-glock-43x-handgun-cerakoted-with-h311-pink-champagne/)"

None of the artisans have their original casing, they'll be shipped with a lot of bubble wrap.

**PRICES REDUCED AGAIN, YOU WILL NOT FIND LOWER FOR WHAT YOU GET**

Hey guys, I've acquired some things over the last couple months that I've decided would be better put in the hands of someone who will use them more than I will. 
**As always, please comment before sending a PM.**

**HAVE**

Realforce R2A-JP4-BKJ ($275 USD shipped CONUS): This is the latest limited edition joint effort between Justsystems and Topre. The board has uniform 45g domes, comes with all original accessories, and is in flawless (unused) condition. Extremely nice build quality compared to R1 Realforce boards, no creak or flex to the case at all. Plate is spotless and the board has never been opened or modified. The board is one of just 500 produced, and features the iconic bright red caps present on previous collaboration boards. It does come with keycaps to black out the red keys as well, should you want to do so.

~~HHKB Pro 2 with Realforce silent purple sliders ($250 USD shipped CONUS): Excellent condition, comes with purple Realforce sliders on all keys but the left shift and enter key (the HHKB housings don't play quite as nice with the wider stabilized RF sliders). Stock 45g uniform domes and black-on-black dyesub caps, will include a set of 55g Realforce domes cut to fit and/or a sealed bag of BKE Redux heavy domes to balance trades or for an additional $50 USD.~~ **SOLD**

**WANT (PRIORITY TO TRADES)**

Interesting 60%-75% board trades: I have a soft spot for PC boards and grey aluminum boards. This includes both full builds and unbuilt kits.

Good Cherry profile dyesubs (CRP, IMSTO, etc.)

GMK keycap sets: Open to anything that isn't DMG.

Other miscellaneous offers: If you think you have something special that I haven't mentioned, there is always a chance that I will consider it, so the worst thing I can say is ""no thanks."" Don't hesitate to message me.

Hi Everyone,

looking to sell basically a whole keyboard kit that i got left with.

This was supposed to be a build for a coworker who then decided that he is more into razer and left me with everything that i paid for in advance.

Looking to sell everything a tad below the retail price and not factoring in the custom fees i had to pay for the Case and PCB.

Everything is new and unused:

~~Kbdfans DZ60 USB-C PCB                         30€~~

~~Kprepublic GH60 Aluminium Case Grey USB-C      30€~~

&#x200B;

Would prefer to sell case and PCB together which ends up being 60€

Everything else can be added to the offer above, everything new and unused:

&#x200B;

87x Gateron Black 3Pin                     20€

~~70x Kailh Box Reds Retooled                20€~~

~~Polycarbonate Plate 2.25U left shift       15€~~

~~Black Aluminium Plate                      10€~~

~~GMK Screw in Stabs 4x2u 1x6.25u            10€~~

PCB Mount Stabilizer                       5€

&#x200B;

I cover the Paypal fees!

Tracked shipping in Germany would be 5€, tracked inside EU would be 14€

Untracked inside EU should be cheaper, but there is nothing covered by DHL if the package gets lost.

&#x200B;

Please comment before PM!

Thank you!"

[Glamour shots](https://imgur.com/a/NZJY6AH) (on a potato camera :)

All prices are in USD, are OBO, and include CONUS shipping (if you are international we can potentially work something out). Not FCFS. I will prioritize bundles and US buyers. Ideally not looking to split any of the sets or desolder any boards, but I might if there isn't any interest as-is. If you are interested in a part of a bundle, leave a comment with what you are interested in and if there are other people who want to split it up with you then we can talk about it, but I won't split unless I have buyers for everything.

These boards are my babies, but I'm not in a position where I feel good about having this much money locked up in keyboards so I'm letting them go. They were all built and painstakingly tuned by me. I'm pretty OCD about making the boards perfect for me and about taking care of my stuff (I even wash my hands before I use my keyboards like 8/10 times), so they are all in excellent condition (documented below). I'm not trying to extort anyone, but I used premium parts, a good number of extras, and lots of time for all of these builds so keep that in mind and if you think the prices are unfair I'm happy to explain my pricing and open to feedback -- and remember that all prices are OBO.

**Keyboards**

|~~PC E6.5~~|~~Black nametag, black and white weight. Built with black aluminum half plate, 205g0 lubed and filmed Gateron black inks with 68s Sprit springs, clipped, lubed (dielectric grease), and band-aid modded GMK stabilizers (screw-in on L-shift and enter, clip-in on space and backspace for gasket compatibility)~~|~~I would prefer to sell this with one of the keycap bundles (red samurai looks amazing on this). Pretty much flawless condition -- there is one exceptionally superficial scratch~~ [~~here~~](https://imgur.com/a/YMqCDhU)~~that can only be seen in perfect lighting and my phone can't capture. This board does not have the PC machining marks some boards from this group buy have. The number row does not have switch films. Exceptionally smooth with a wonderfully firm, gentle bottom out on the half plate. Smoothest and best sounding board I've ever heard.~~|~~$685 shipped. Ships in original box with all original parts/packaging/screws etc.~~ SOLD FOR 675|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|~~Switch Couture frosted acrylic Alice~~|~~Built with purple Project Keyboard PCB, 63.5g Zealios lubed with 3204 and sip socketed, 5x 2u zeal stabilizers lubed with 205g0, gold countersunk screws, presently using white in-switch LEDS with warm white indicator lights. Can send some different color LEDs too if interested, just pm and I'll see. I think I have blue, green, and red? I'd have to check~~|~~Perfect condition - used lightly for a few weeks. Zealios were initially 67g and the color matches the PCB pretty well.~~|~~$340 shipped~~ SOLD|
|~~Anne Pro 2 (zilents, mkultra, o-ring mount)~~|~~Black AP2 desoldered and re-built with 3204 lubed and filmed 67g zilents with MKUltra foam between plate and PCB, neoprene under the PCB, and o-rings stacked and compressed on all mounting points for a gasket tray mount~~|~~Used as my travel and school board for about 4 months. Excellent condition, no noticeable scuffs or anything. No louder than any old membrane keyboard.~~|~~$185 shipped~~ SOLD|
|Crkbd|Dark acrylic sandwich case, purple cherry hotswap PCB with Kailh hotswap sockets, white OLEDs, SMD RGB LEDs. The microcontrollers and LEDs are socketed so you can swap them. The left side has a pro micro and the right side has an Elite-C. Small rubber feet on the bottom case|Excellent condition. This works perfectly, but only registers both sides if plugged into the pro micro on the left side. If you plug into the Elite-C, it only registers the right side keypresses and registers them as the left side. According to OLKB, you might be able to fix this by matching the micro-controllers on each side or with some EEPROM stuff, but I don't know.|$110 without caps, $130 with Kbdfans shine through caps. NO SWITCHES|

**Keysets**

I would prefer to ship these in bags for simplicity. I do have the trays so if you really want them then let me know but you'll pay the extra shipping. If you purchase a big bundle (metropolis, or any keyset + a keyboard) I'll probably ship in the tray since I'll need to find a bigger box anyways.

|JTK Hyperfuse|Bought from Novelkeys extras sale. Used very lightly for a few weeks. No shine.|$160|
|:-|:-|:-|
|~~GMK Metropolis Bundle~~|~~All kits (base, blocks, signs, midnight), desk mat, 2x 3' coiled cables (USB-C and Mini-USB), and 65% YCP sleeve with internal and external pockets. Used a mixture of the kits on a 65% for a couple of days. No shine. Will discuss breaking up the cables/sleeve/mat but only if all kits and sleeve are spoken for~~|~~$495. $470 if you buy this with the PC e6.5 and I will include the blank blue E6.5 nametag so you can match! If you only want one cable bump the price down $30~~ SOLD|
|~~GMK Red Samurai Bundle~~|~~Drop 65% red samurai keycaps and color-matched Exclusive 65% sleeve with internal pocket. used for a couple of months. Very, very slight shine on the spacebar and none noticeable on any other keys~~|~~$120 shipped or $100 with E6.5~~|

Hi Everyone,

I've been without work for a couple of months and figure I might as well turn keyboards back into cash and let someone else enjoy these boards. Sorry, but no trades unless you have a set of GMK Mitolet :)

&#x200B;

**IBM Model F AT -** [Album including short video](https://imgur.com/gallery/N2aOd4Z)

* Great condition, I would say 8 - 8.5 / 10 - see photos for the wear on the case.
* Cord is in excellent condition, not sticky at all, coil is stretchy.
* Plate shows no visible signs of rust from the top but I did not open the case - see photos.
* The . / Del key on the numpad is from a Model M (note the secondary legend for Del is beige instead of black)
* Everything else is 100% stock
* Everything works, I've used this Model F for about 4 months, on average about 1-2 days a week.
* AT to PS2 adapter included.
* If you want extra Model M keys to ANSI mod / Backspace mod / numpad mod / unstepped ALT, let me know and I can throw them in for $10.
* **PRICE: $200 + shipping** (I will ship anywhere - please include your zip code so I can quote you if you are interested. Otherwise I am local to Los Angeles and would gladly meet you locally)

&#x200B;

***SOLD -*** **YMDK84 75% in Acrylic Case -** [Album](https://imgur.com/a/M6cLHUw)

* All switches lubed with 3203 & I think MX Black springs (not 100% sure but they feel almost identical to my stock blacks)
   * Cherry Vintage Black Housing with NK Cream Stems
   * NK Cream Housing with Gateron Ink Silent Black Stem for the spacebar
   * Outemu Silent Tactile with 80g spring for CapsLock
* Zeal Stabilizers lubed with EK stabilizer lube
* currently has 7u / WKL layout - [see here](https://i.imgur.com/UjAaEGQ.png)
* I can include a 6.25u stab wire upon request if you plan on changing the layout.
* Silver Plate
* USB Type C / Bootmapper PCB
* Everything works - no lifted pads or jumped wires.

Looking to sell a few boards that I don't really use anymore.

|Duck Viper v2|Black Bottom, Silver Top.           Custom Brass Plate/Viper PCB - Vintage Cherry Blacks lubed with Krytox GPL 104, Stickered with white switch films, and lubed Zeal stabs.                                          Carbon Fiber Plate/DP60 PCB - Gateron Black Inks lubed with 204g0, Sprit 69s springs lubed with Kin Oil. PCB has per key rgb, underglow rgb, is USB-C, and is QMK Configurator compatible.                                        This board types like a dream, both plates support switch top opening and I have tuned and lubed each switch to be as consistent as I possibly could. Has a small ding on the front of the case. Comes with extra silver aluminum plate. [Ding](https://imgur.com/a/7b9LXL7)|$750|

|VE.A|Black Case/Black Alu Plate - Stock Zealio v1 R8 and lubed zeal stabs. Has a lifted pad that has been jumped. Bought this off another user, amazing board but layouts not for me.|$600|
|Mechmini v1|Acrylic Sandwich Case - Box Yellows lubed with Krytox GPL 104. These are original box switches and as such have been known to crack/stretch stems. I have never had an issue with them but it is a possibility. I have had leopold pbt and gmk keycaps on these with no issues.|$80|
|Mechmini RGB|Polycarb/Steel Plate - Novel Key Creams lubed with Tribosys 3203 and lubed and band aid modded Zeal Stabs. Comes with steel Ortho Plate|$160|

# Who and why

I'm a mechanical keyboards veteran who has been building a decent amount of boards through three years in this hobby. You might have known me from my [infamous mature and responsible post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/97e4ft/yo_dawg_i_hear_from_rlifeprotips_that_pouring/) or [this humble piece](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/dfu5w5/first_handwired_hopefully_last_endgame_the_sakata/). My obsession with Plancks and the impossibility of acquiring it years ago (I don't know if it still is) compelled me to stock up an unhealthy amount of Planck supplies, including cases, plates and PCBs, which I have been joking about as a lifetime supply (which might be true).

And of course, there's time to unload them eventually. I have been rambling about my plan to quit my job and go back to college and procrastinating it, and the funds I get from this sale is going to help.

Before anyone asks, **with the exception of the NL-Bullet and the ACE-XT40, nothing is for sale separately without a Planck order.**

I look forward to having fun in building your dream board.

#What

I'm going to build you **a Low-profile Planck rev 4** for **$140 shipped** (unless price modifiers applied) **within two week at most** (should be much faster, I'm just trying to not overpromise). This is not a hotswap, but the good old reliable mini-USB and old-fashioned PCBs that require soldering (which I'm going to do).

([Let me flex the upper deck of my desk at the moment](https://imgur.com/sm1tKSj), so you can have some confidence in me)

They will be built with care and consideration exactly the way I have built all of mine. The process will be done slowly to make sure that potential flaws are detected and intervened. Stabilisers will be clipped, bandaged, lubed, unless requested not to.

Do note that, except for the MD B-stock cases, most items are in used condition and might come with usage marks. I will take pictures of the items I'm going to use before starting. The final board will also be thoroughly tested and inspected to meet standard, because I don't like half-arsing. Do take note if you need a Planck urgently.

#How

* Read through the mandatory menu and pick the items you'd like to have.

* Read through the optional menu, think through whether you need them, and pick what you'd like to have.

* Specify thoroughly any special request.

* Wait for my confirmation, a timestamp of the wares I'm going to use, and pay the invoice once satisfied, so I can get started.

* Wait for some teaser pictures and the arrival of the board.

#Notes

* **I will take only four orders for this round**, to maintain quality and avoid being overwhelmed.

* This is not FCFS. I may choose my buyer at my own discretion. Priority goes to people I know personally, followed by people I have traded with.

* With the exception of the NL-Bullet and the ACE-XT40, nothing is for sale without a Planck order.

* As usual, please comment before messaging.

* Fulfillment of the invoice is required before any work is started. Same for locals.

* All items will be shipped via SingPost with tracking.

* Locals please message specifically with your order for a local price.

* I appreciate public questions, which will benefit other interested buyers as well.


and without further ado, here's the menu:

#Mandatory menu

##Case

All cases are brand new from Massdrop B-stock. I do not notice any flaw in them. Colors available: black, ~~gunmetal~~, green, pink.

If you choose to build with the NL-Bullet or the XT40, then ignore this and go straight to the special menu.

##Layout

MIT or grid layout.

##Plate

* I have a wide range of standard steel plates that span through multiple revisions. They are too diverse to describe. Many are of MIT. 

Do note that the steel plates are all in used condition, and come with signs of usage. I will try my best to show you the condition of what I am going to use.

I will take consideration of your switches and layout to choose the best possible plate, so please do let me know what the rest of your order looks like.

* I also have the FR4 plates that come from the EOTW kit, which are extremely light and good-looking. I will drill screw holes to adapt them to low-pro cases. [The idea result looks like this](https://imgur.com/a/nQBwmGW).

* I can also use the gold-coloured side of the EOTW plate.

I'm also going to use my own screws to match whichever plates you choose.

##Stabiliser

I have:

* Clear screw-in Zealios stabiliser.

* Black GMK screw-in stabiliser.

* Black clip-on Cherry-made stabiliser.

* You also have the option to go stabiliser-less. Do note that there is no price reduction for this option.

##Switches

Here's what I have at hand:

* Cherry MX Clear

* Cherry MX Brown

* Cherry MX Speed silver

* Cherry MX black (I have no idea where this pack comes from, probably old stock, but they're slightly smoother than the black retooled)

* Cherry MX black retooled

* Cherry MX Blue

* Gateron brown (3-pin variant)

* Gateron black (milky variant)

* Gateron black (SMD variant, white bottom) (I have only 46 of this, I can throw in a standard Gateron black or something else, let me know how you'd like to work it out)

* Kailh Burgundy

* Kailh Speed silver

* Kailh Copper (standard white bottom variant)

* Kailh Copper (rare 3-pin black bottom variant)

* Kailh Burnt Orange (heavy speed tactile)

* Kailh Berry (heavy linear)

* MOD-H (+$20)

* Linjar (+$15)

* Tangerine C3 62g (milky bottom) Round 1 (+$20)

* Zealios 65g milky bottom (exact round unknown, but definitely early batches) (+$20)

* Zealios 62g (exact round unknown, but definitely early batches) (+$20)

Most of these were used and desoldered, and again, I will thoroughly test and make sure that they work.

If what you'd like is a common and regular Cherry MX or Gateron switch that I do not have here, do query, as I may be able to purchase from a local vendor. For maximum satisfaction.

If you'd like to go crazy (different switches for mods and alphas, for example), let me know, too.

I'd also throw in a couple of extra switches if available, so you can do your own repair/replacement when needed.

#Optional menu

##Inclination

The standard rubber feet that came with all of the MD cases will be included. If you do need an inclination, do let me know as I have those door bumpers I have been using on all of my boards.

They come in transparent and black.

##Keycaps 

* OEM black blank (+$10)

* ~~DSA light grey blank (+$10)~~

* XDA light grey blank (+$17)

* ~~DSA white, alphas are printed, but mods are blank (+$15)~~

* XDA Canvas for Planck, beta alphas with icon mods (+$50)

* XDA Canvas for Preonic, beta alphas with icon mods (+$60)

* XDA Canvas for Planck, alpha alphas with text mods (+$70)

XDA Canvas' prices are high because I'd like to keep them. You are recommended to source your own keycaps.


#SPECIAL MENU

Both of them come with a custom-cut black acrylic plate, specifically for these cases.

## ACE-XT40

In black, has some scruff marks inside and at the bottom (very hard to capture in photographs), otherwise in pristine condition. Edges are sharp and surfaces are beautiful.

Doesn't come with the original plate, the PCB or the rubber feet.

Asking for $120 separately or +$80 to be used in a Planck order.

## NL-Bullet

Comes with the original brass plate, which is bloody garbage and has damaged many of my switches.

In ivory white. Some unremarkable scruff marks at the bottom and inside (hard to capture). I have replaced the smaller feet as they were garbage and could not stick. The bigger ones won't stay long, either. Will throw in my dark grey 3M door bumper.

Terrible rubber feet asides, it is in good condition.

Asking for $120 separately or +$80 to be used in a Planck order."

Hey guys, I have some items to sell

All prices include PayPal fees but do not include shipping fees. Please PM me for the shipping quote, should be around $30 for the board, $10 for artisan. As usual please comment before DM.

**1.** **Clueboard LP 66%** in custom powder coated color (Illusion Cinnamon). Built with fully modded and lubed GMK stabs. Lightly used for 1 month. The surface is super glossy so there are some barely visible hairline scratches on the bottom from the factory as well as a couple of tiny nicks I put while pulling switches out (see ""Pictures of Condition"" album below). Color is hard to capture on camera, it also does change a lot depending on the lighting, please see pictures.

More pretty pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/iS9SgMm](https://imgur.com/a/iS9SgMm)

~~It has gateron brown switches for everything other than the thumb keys.  For the 2u thumb keys, I used a linear gateron yellow key, which has less travel and requires more weight than red.  This has the middle spacer included, but I never tried adding any hardware to tent the halves.~~

~~The stabilizers are GMK that screw to the PCB so they're really solid with no vibration.  Please note, the LEDS do not work, however, I soldered in all the components and just didn't want to bother with working out the problem since the LEDS aren't a concern for me.  If you want to try to get them working, all the resistors should be soldered in place and I used SIP sockets so you can add and remove the LEDs without additional soldering.~~

PCB was desoldered; some LED pads are lifted, but all switches are working. Slight discoloration on the front left edge. Little chip on one of the screw holes.

Hello,

I was going through the mail when I got back from the holiday and have some stuff that I would like to sell rather than hold on to. Everything is sealed except for the bento nano which I opened to inspect before promptly repackaging it. Everything is 100% unused. For now I am only interested in selling to CONUS, if things go unsold I will include them in later posts. Keyboard kits do NOT include keycaps, switches, stabilizers. Prices have all paypal fees built into them.



Item | Description | Asking Price | Status
---|---|----|----
RAMA M60-A Sequence 2 Stealth Moon (Hotswap) w/ Internal Dampener extra | Brand new and still sealed. Includes the internal dampener which is an extra purchase. The box with the chassis is sealed still, the PCB was opened and then resealed. Everything unused. Pricing is to reflect the high cost of having the kits shipped from RAMA in Australia. | 500 + shipping | SOLD LOCALLY
RAMA M60-A Sequence 2 Milk (Hotswap) w/ Internal Dampener extra | Brand new and still sealed. Includes the internal dampener which is an extra purchase. The box with the chassis is sealed still. Everything unused. Pricing is to reflect the high cost of having the kits shipped from RAMA in Australia. | 600 + shipping | SOLD FOR ASKING
GMK Wavez Bundle | Still sealed. Includes Base kit, Novelties, and RAMA cap. Not splitting. | 260 + shipping | SOLD for 260 shipped
Space 65 Stormtrooper Kit (solder) | White body, black plate, black badge, PCB included but is packaged separately. Purchased in the extra sale and then realized I have enough 65% boards. Completely new. | 350 + shipping | SOLD for asking
Keebwerk Nano Slider Bento Macropad, Aluminum Bottom | Wow, what a gorgeous macropad. Includes GMK Bento novelty caps with special edition metal keycap. Full aluminum construction. Really a shame this product was delayed for so long because I forgot I had ordered it and have already parted ways with my bento base kit. I opened the kit to inspect it and figure out exactly what was included with it. Promptly placed it back into original package after taking timestamp picture. Comes stock with Cherry MX Clears but is hotswap capable.  | 200 + shipping | SOLD for asking

Please leave a comment before PMing me. Do not use reddit chat, use the actual inbox. I do not check reddit chat and can't access it on the Apollo mobile app. Sale is NOT FCFS. Priority to buyers purchasing multiple items.

Doing some cleaning for the new year! Getting rid of some things that have been sitting around. Feel free to counteroffer if my prices are off. This sale is NOT FCFS. I will prefer local sales and bundles before shipping items out (I'm local to SF bay area).

Shipping will be around $10-$20 depending on the size of the package.

~~Realforce 104u - $120+Shipping~~ SOLD

I got this keyboard second-hand from someone who harvested the board for silenced sliders, rings and keycaps. I rebuilt the board using stock 45g topre domes and sliders. The keycaps are a mix of realforce 108 and 87 keys that I had sitting around. I was missing 3 keys, so I replaced them with POM keycaps from kbdfans (bottom left ctrl, numpad 0, and numpad +). I've only used the board for a few weeks and it's still very clean. This board will come with some extra realforce keycaps and a set of KBDfans POM keycaps [pictured here](https://i.imgur.com/IFSK6OI.jpg).

~~Novatouch case and parts - $40+Shipping~~ SOLD

This is a harvested novatouch board. It ONLY comes with the product box, case, PCB and springs. It does still have the novatouch spacebar stabilizer if anyone wants that. [WYSIWYG](https://i.imgur.com/fnDIOQ6.jpg)

Good afternoon /r/mechmarket 

Today up for sale is one item and one item only.  My built, blue Exent which has been my home daily driver for quite a few months now.  However with my latest purchase I've moved it off to the side, and with an S7 Elephant on the way, I don't need 2 majorly chonky boards in my collection.  Even as cool as it is.

I purchased this board as an unbuilt kit back in July and it has been an amazing home board.  It's been built with:

* Sandblasted Brass Plate
* Polycarb Bottom, 8 degree foot
* Lubed T1's with Christo-Lube MCG 111, (originally purchased from the Worldspawn GB early this year)
* Lubed Helio with Christo-Lube MCG 129 in the space bar for silencing
* Clipped, Band-aid modded, and lubed GMK Screw in Stabilizers (no rattles)

The board is FLAWLESS.  No nicks, scratches, marks or anything on the case, polycarb bottom, or steel foot.  The sandblasted plate has some small cosmetic imperfections, but that's how it came to me.  Just some tiny scratches and spots, but nothing bigger than a mm or 2.  (You're not going to see them anyway with keycaps on)

I flashed a pretty standard layout on here with BMC since it's the original PCB.  All LEDs and keys work and there are no issues with this PCB such as the previous Exent I purchased.

**I'm asking $600 + Shipping and PP Fees for the board throughout CONUS.**  I'm not currently looking to ship this board internationally at this time due to the cost.

That being said, board trades actually take priority over sale for me.  I'm looking for any other high end 65% boards such as the M65-A, or similar. (Something heavy but not super chonky like the Exent) If your board is unbuilt and you think I'd like it, that is taking even higher priority for me. 

I'm open to offers.  However I am not looking for any Tofu, KBDfans, or Poker boards, thanks.

Hey guys, I have some items to sell

All prices include PayPal fees but do not include shipping fees. Please PM me for the shipping quote, should be around $30 for the board, $10 for artisan. As usual please comment before DM.

**1.** **Clueboard LP 66%** in custom powder coated color (Illusion Cinnamon). Built with fully modded and lubed GMK stabs. Lightly used for 1 month. The surface is super glossy so there are some barely visible hairline scratches on the bottom from the factory as well as a couple of tiny nicks I put while pulling switches out (see ""Pictures of Condition"" album below). Color is hard to capture on camera, it also does change a lot depending on the lighting, please see pictures.

  -  [IBM 5251 album](https://imgur.com/a/eGW8zT7) $1450 obo

This board is dated back to 1981 and is in pretty good shape for its age. As you can see in the album it has some scuffs and has a chip in the bottom right of the case. On the inside it had a screw in post that is cracked but doesn’t affect the solidity at all. These are the only cosmetic problems it has. Internally everything seems perfect.  The internals are stock so this is not converted and sold as is. The keyboard has been taken apart, cleaned and reassembled so the only thing left to do to use it would be to convert it via an xwhatsit. The foam is brand new and I have lightly lubed the switches, o-rings and springs with some VPF1514. 

-  GMK Bento 260$ 

~~Box opened for pics otherwise brand new~~ On hold 


-  ~~3x100 MX Vintage blacks 75-90$~~ **SOLD**

~~These are all unsoldered from Wyse terminal keyboards that date back to 1985. Ultrasonically cleaned and ready to take the lube of your choice. 
Two batches I’d rate at an 8.5. The other I’d rate a 7.5 because some of the switches feel a bit scratchy  and I don’t know if some lube will bring them back or not, has enough for a tkl worth of good switches as is. 75 for this batch and 90 for the two others.~~


-  [Ergodox infinity](https://imgur.com/a/Mx5njOC) ~~$150 obo~~  **SOLD**

~~Not too much to say about this as it’s a friends board. It has cherry reds, had a key with a broken stem but that was repaired but missing that keycap. Comes with some random keycaps that don’t fit that key though. Other then that board is in working order but will need the cables.~~

-  [Ibm 5140 and Apple IIc keysets](https://imgur.com/a/kRbHBNo) ~~$30/$20~~ Pending

~~From the boards above and both in great shape as you can see in the album. Asking for $30 and $20 respectively. Comes with all the stabilizers.~~


-  [62x Amber “Taxi” alps](https://imgur.com/a/UeREFcf) ~~$180~~  **SOLD**

~~These things are awesome and in great shape. I’d say they are very near NOS! Consistent through the batch and still have the original lube on the sliders. Opened a couple up to see how they were and decided to not clean them as they are already a 10/10. No binding whatsoever, very tactile and refined for a clicky switch~~


- [Alps SKFF Keyboard unit](https://imgur.com/gallery/tJgCpo3) ~~40$~~ Pending 

~~Taken from a canon typewriter. The switches are mostly SKFF whites but also has some SKFF double action blacks. Project has been on the backseat since and just want to recoup what I paid for it. Comes with plate, pcb, switches, keycaps and a couple of extra switches.~~

-  [Fostex TH-X00](https://imgur.com/a/atiMZNo) trade value $250

Last but not least I have a set of Fostex TH-X00 mahogany headphones that have under 30 hours of use. Bought these NIB a while ago and although how great they are I basically don’t have the time to use them so I just want to give them a new home. 


As usual leave a message below before pm’ing, prices are in USD and shipping is not included. Not FCFS and will be happy to get you a shipping quote. If some prices seem off don’t be a dick and just message me about it!

Happy New Year, r/mm!       

I've had some time off so I've gotten everything organized... and it's time to get rid of a lot of stuff.

~~First: my unbuilt [Exent kit](https://imgur.com/BqfKsaR) with [acrylic bottom](https://imgur.com/n7Simvc) and [extra PCB](https://imgur.com/QWJn7uX). The switches are in place, but after three months, I still haven't gotten around to soldering them. $750 with switches, $700 without.~~ __SOLD__

Now, on to keycap sets and such:     

[SA Rocketeer](https://imgur.com/oQ0a6Qm): 60% kit comes with what's pictured; however, you can pick up some more mods on [Drop](https://mechkeys.drop.com/products/massdrop-x-zslane-mercury-rocketeer-keyboard-keycaps-64755?variant=31411737886764) right now. $125    

[SA Carbon](https://imgur.com/s5mZ4Tx): TKL kit with some extras and Vim. All are unused except the Vim caps, which I bought used, and seem to have a bit of shine. $180

[SA Calm Depths](https://imgur.com/8j0KxtM): SP round one version with a couple extra kits. Great for [full size](https://imgur.com/IY0Dphu) builds. $195

[SA Godspeed](https://imgur.com/4qMK83k): ~~full set $225;~~__SOLD__  extra numpad (pictured in everything stamp) $70

[SA Symbiosis alphas](https://imgur.com/DlHOHBK): $60

[SA Lime](https://imgur.com/4JqR4Tn) extras: made by SP; please note that the ""tab"" is actually an R3 ""meta."" $50

[SA Nuclear Data](https://imgur.com/AdJkG4i) numpad: $30

[SA gray-ish vomit](https://imgur.com/jut8DH6): $80

[SA reddish vomit](https://imgur.com/78aRRIh): $80

[SA rainbow blanks](https://imgur.com/QbYUYpv): $95

~~[GMK R2 Carbon alphas & Vim arrows](https://imgur.com/sTGXuCY): this is just for the Carbon keys pictured, not the Solarized mods. $95~~ __SOLD__

[GMK Ocean Dolch mods](https://imgur.com/ZTUd7gs): $85

~~[GMK beige/L9 Space Keys](https://imgur.com/auEleqe): I was hoping these would match the Carbon set; alas, they did not. Goodbye to both. $20~~ _pending_

I think that covers the organized sets. Now: on to the less organized stuff. Folks, I love making vomit sets, but I need to find (marginally) more productive uses of my time. Priced to move.     
Moderately organized:      
- [my absurd mod collection](https://imgur.com/u5HnMBh): also includes novelties & space bars; several grab bags' worth. My vomit set base assortment of mostly ""standard"" layout keys, but with a bunch of extras/non-standard stuff included as well. Comes shipped in a bag, not that monstrous container. $100     
- [my slightly more absurd alpha collection](https://imgur.com/PdGeDIY): also includes F-row, esc, and numpad stuff. All keys are ""standard"" 1-1-2-3-4-X row. $115 in bags, $150 in the containers       
 - both of the above: $185 in bags, $210 in the (alphas only) containers

Total disarray:     
- [big](https://imgur.com/ynRQm3Q) [bag](https://imgur.com/BETmmtE) of SA legends: mix of alphas and mods; mostly non-standard stuff that didn't make it into the above sorting. $50      
- [colored blanks](https://imgur.com/fJEo0xS): mostly 1U but with a bunch of larger sizes mixed in. $45    
- [light & dark neutral blanks](https://imgur.com/dsdQAAb) (both bags): $55

I think that covers everything!!      
As usual, most of these are less than what I paid, I'm open to negotiation, and all that stuff. Prices include PP fees & shipping to ConUS. Willing to consider shipping internationally but it ain't cheap. Sorry, but I don't set the prices.     
Please comment before PMing. Going to be running errands all afternoon, so I might be slow to respond. Generally FCFS but if it's close, I'll prioritize bundles (and knock some dollars off) to make my life easier.     

As always, thanks for looking! If prices are wrong etc. feel free to downvote and comment, but please don't PM to yell at me.      

Thanks again and enjoy 2020!

In my ever ending pursuit of new boards, it's time for more stuff to be put up for sale.

* HHKB Type-S Bundle

~~Full disclosure, I LOVE this board, but at the same time it's my only Topre and I'm looking to get something in the 65% or 75% range that's high end, so this is the board on the chopping block.~~  

~~Today I'm putting this board up for sale with everything as 1 single bundle.  I'm not looking to split at this time so please don't ask, **unless** you're only looking to purchase the Artisan Topre Keys separately.~~ 

HHKB Type-S:

* Japanese Bottom Case
* Lubed Sliders and Stabilizers
* 45g BKE Domes
* Yang BLE Controller with Battery (Programmable by YDKB.io)
* Mitchcapped Abyss Mods and WASD Cluster

Comes with:

* Remaining Stock, Blank Keycaps
* Original Box, Instructions, Cable, Controller, and Domes
* Set of KBDfans MX Sliders (thought I would change over and never did)
* Hidden Labs Orange and Black Mods and Spacebar
* Hidden Labs Rubber Gaming Caps and Spacebar
* Purple Topre Modifiers (One has a scratch, see pictures for detail)

~~This board has been my daily to and from work for about a month and a half now.  It's fantastic and the bluetooth lasts for WEEKS.  I don't think I've dropped below 80% since I've owned it or between charges.  Great for portability and ease of use since you can remap some keys to your liking.~~  

**Important details (See Pictures)**

~~I dropped this board from about 3 feet on to my tile floor unintentionally.  Good news: Nothing cracked, nothing inside the board broke.  I opened it and checked, everything still works flawlessly.  Bad News: There are 2 dents on the back corners of the board.  The one on the back right is the ""worst"" of the 2.  They aren't visible when in use, but they are there.  The one on the back left is very minor and you won't see it unless you're specifically looking for it.~~  

~~It sucks, I hate that I dropped the board, but it is what it is, and really doesn't detract from the fact that this board is fantastic to use.  If this minor set of imperfections bothers you, then this board isn't for you.~~  

~~**I am asking $335 O.B.O. Shipped CONUS with PP Fees Included for EVERYTHING above.**  You get the board, all the modifications, all the topre keys, and all the original components. This is WAY less than I paid for all of the additional add-ons to the board and the board itself.~~

~~Everything will be packaged neatly and in bags and bubble wrapped priority mail to you.  This is a true endgame package and will make a GREAT work board for someone.~~

**___________________________________________________________**

* Keyforge Artisans

~~I am looking to permanently get out of Artisans completely.  These are my last 2 remaining and I'm motivated to move them.~~

~~* Mulder V2 (Don't know the colorway name but it's a perfect match with GMK Laser)~~
~~* Lord of Saliva Shishi~~ 

~~Both are unmounted and in perfect condition.  **I'm asking $70 for the Mulder and $120 for the Shishi.  Purchase both for $165 bundled!**~~

~~If you think my pricing is off make me a reasonable offer on both and we can probably make a deal!~~

**___________________________________________________________**

* Keycap Trays

Honestly I have no idea what to ask for these and I'm just looking to get them moved out of my office/house.  

**I'm going to ask $25/GMK Tray and Box Shipped and $14/KBDFans Trays.**

If I'm off and you want to make an offer on these trays, please don't hesitate.  They're a pain to ship as you guys know, so I'm willing to work with you if you want more than one of them!
