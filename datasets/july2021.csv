As title says I'm finally selling off my set of GMK Delta... It was used a few times but I rotate my keyboards enough to never develop shine. I can share more photos but the caps look basically new. I did check the spacebars to make sure they were not affected by the slightly cooler colors of some set and these are in perfect condition. Will ship in included acrylic box and proper packaging.

I am mainly looking for trades of some older sets but if nothing comes up I might hold out for Bushido or PayPal - price if selling $600 + Shipping. My preferred sets in order:

1. GMK Jamon + forties + optional novelties
2. GMK Botanical + Spacebars + optional novelties
3. GMK First Love + Spacebars + optional novelties

Update: Traded for GMK Botanical and Cash"

Return 60 | 375 | I received it from the GB with many small scratches on the weight, but they're so small and anodized over so they don't show in pictures. Otherwise the board is in good condition. Comes with desoldered bootmapper PCB and original box.
Zer0.9 EE | 500 | Desoldered once, no blemishes. Comes with c^3 PCB and iron plate.
HHHH Salamander | 700 | Has a few issues. The previous owner had the case powder coated, and I think some screws are hard to get in as a result. Weight has a good amount of patina but can easily been cleaned. Alu plate was spray painted by previous owner and has some rough spots especially around the edges. [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/C3TsEqq). Comes with desoldered H87a.
Mekanisk Klippe S | 250 | Missing a plate screw. Plate and PCB around one switch is scratches, but not visible since that switch is under the blocker. I don't know how this happened and am not the original owner. [Pic](https://i.imgur.com/SeKfxbx.jpg).

Hi mechmarket, 

For sale is my set of gmk olivia dark base. It's seen some light use but has otherwise been chilling in my drawer. There's a minimal amount of shine on the first row  alphas but you really have to be looking for it to see it.

*(Trying something new with these pics. I think my previous pics taken inside kind of yellow-up some of the colors. So this batch is taken on my balcony with natural light and I think it gives a much truer colors of everything. I'm not a fan of all the extra shadows though, so let me know if you want more pics or even if you think these are shitty pictures)*

Hey-hey, MM!

I've been building a collection and trading around, and I'm looking to pare it back a bit and trade into some of my higher priority wants. I'm just a boy standing in front of the faceless void of a community forum, asking them to trade with him.

# HAVES:

Below is this month's list of the info for the artisans I have *(shipping isn't included)*. Open to bundling to get that savings on.

Artkey, JellyKey, Keypora, Lats all have authenticity cards and anything that came in a rigid case (JellyKey, Clackeys, ProjectKey, etc) will come with that, too.

If it has a price, it's ***also*** ***open for trades***. Happy to do n:1 or top up with paypal if that's how it shakes out.

Also, I've had these Laser sets gathering dust. I've never opened them, but I placed their orders when I got into the hobby, before I realized how much I preferred backlit caps. Hoping these get to a good home!

Hi everyone, getting rid of inventory as I'll be moving soon! Prices are all OBO as I haven't been in the market recently and only based prices off of other posts and previous history :)

DZ60, Sentraq Gold Aluminum Plate, 62g Zilents lubed with Tribosys 3203, OEM stabs (lubed + bandaid modded) and White LEDs, some cheap white typewriter keycaps from Amazon

**Note:** For this board, it is in good condition but has some scratches on the bottom due to use, you won't notice it when using it normally though, and it does not affect underglow at all.

&#x200B;

**GMK Olivia++ RAMA Enter - $325 + shipping**

Lightly used, in good condition

**Unholy Pandas - $0.15 per switch OBO + $5 shipping**

Just a bunch of unholy pandas that I have left over after making Holy YOK pandas for my friends, really want to get rid of these so just give me a price and I'll probably accept. You can also buy in bulk for very cheap - I have a ton. These are just some cheap linears made with Halo Clear housings + springs and a YOK Trash panda stem.

Hi All,

Hope you're doing well today. I have for sale a Black LZ Physix bundle which includes the following:

* Black LZ Physix Chassis currently built with Holy Koalas (Milky Gat tops) on the PC plate with Plate foam. SS Weight is currently installed. The PC plate has a coating that lets it glow in the dark if charged.
* Extra PCB (never soldered, tested working) plus Carbon Fiber plate (from GB)
* Physix specific case (foam cut to match the physix) which was part of the original GB
* Physix wrist rest (from original GB).
* All of the extras from the original GB (screws, gaskets, etc).
* GMK Pulse (Hangul alphas with Micons Mods)
* Pulse color-matched USB-C Coiled cable (A-to-C, seen in picture).

I am the original purchaser of this board and keycaps. I used this board for a long time with a different set of keycaps so the Pulse caps are shine free.

Looking for $800 shipped for the bundle. I'm in the SGV in Southern California and I'll give a $50 discount to meet up in person for the exchange.

PLEASE make a comment here first before PMing

Edit: I’m only interested in selling the caps with the bundle currently."

I really like the board and put lots of time for it but unfortunately I can't get used to the Arisu layout, especially without the windows key.

Switches are very smooth and the spring swap makes it amazing. I don't want to sell the switches but the plate is pretty tight that I don't want to take them off, so I think it would be best to leave the switch as is even though is hot swap. I can take them off if you want to buy the board alone.

For the plate I had to sand off the edge a little bit to put the switches and the dial in. The sanded edges are not visible and are covered by the switches.

I believe it has qmk but I never try to deal with it. I took off 2 screws & standoff on the case but I will ship them along with the board. Please check this [Github](https://github.com/null-ll/basketweave) page for more details.

For the board alone: 128 shipped

Board + Switches: 178 shipped

Board + Switches + Keycaps: 198 shipped

Will not sell switches alone. Please reply before pm me.

I have decided that gaming on an 800 dollar keyboard is not worth it especially with how little typing I actually do, and don’t need the huntsman either because I like the apex pro significantly more.

Can sell the keyboard and PCB without the switches or key capsLooking for $345 shipped on the KBD8x no switches or key caps. KBD8x SOLD FOR 375

Looking for $400 with the switches, no keycapsLooking for $750 for the entire keyboardStabs are Durock V2 stabs holee, lubed, and band aid modded with Krytox 205g0

Switches are lubed with tribosys and filmed with deskeys (not by me)

Artisan is a koicap, can sell alone for $95 with original containerAsking $80 for the huntsman TKL, stabs are surprisingly good and I think they might have been lubed from previous owner, can not confirm though.

Hey there, I'm selling this complete set of GMK Honey. I've decided to cut back on the amount of keycaps I have and sadly I GMK Honey did not make the cut for me.

None of these keycaps have ever been mounted. The Base, Alt Alphas, and RAMA packaging have been opened to check that everything is there. The Spacebars and Novelties are unopened.

Please use the pictures to do your own QA as well.

Long time lurker first time poster so I apologize if I broke some rules in this post. I have a set of brand new and unused alphas for the GMK Lasers. I ended up getting a gaijin set like a weeb so I don't need the alphas. This would be great for a smaller build in the 45-60% range. If interested I can throw in the split spacebar set and a few novelty extras. Only trade interested in would be some Boba U4T thocky switches, can add cash on my part to even the trade out if necessary.

Good Afternoon /r/mechmarket 

I have a few items up for sale today and looking to move asap:

~~**Prime Elise**~~

~~Got this in a trade from a fellow 40's discord member.  Good board, but I rarely use it as other boards take precedent for me.  This is the PC case with Brass plate and Hotswap PCB.  The case has no scratches and is in flawless condition.  It has 2 lubed screw in stabilizers, and I will include a full set of KTT Strawberries as well.  (Great linear switches if you haven't tried them yet)~~  

~~**Looking for $375 O.B.O. Shipped CONUS**~~ SOLD FOR $340 Shipped

~~**GMK Modo Light**~~

~~Got this set and like most GMK sets these days, had plans for it 18 months ago, but things have since changed.  I've already sold the 40's kit, so only the base kit remains.  Haven't opened it but the 40's kit looked really nicely done.  Just not for me anymore.~~ 

~~**Looking for $265 Shipped CONUS**~~  SOLD FOR ASKING

~~**Aqua Zilents x59**~~

~~Picked these up in the trade for the Prime_Elise.  Not my personal favorite switch but they're still nice and they look really good. Unopened and completely stock.~~

~~**Asking $45 Shipped CONUS**~~ SOLD FOR ASKING

   * Bought extras, but got handarbeit to replace it.
* GMK White on Black (WoB), Massdrop set (came in old gmk tray, has different kitting and imo nicer legend tolerances), includes JTK trays (may split), light use no visible shine sold
   * Has been my general use keycap set for a few months, bought second hand from someone who used it less than I have, but still in very good condition.

Hi everyone, getting rid of inventory as I'll be moving soon! Prices are all OBO as I haven't been in the market recently and only based prices off of other posts and previous history :)

**Note:** For this board, it is in good condition but has some scratches on the bottom due to use, you won't notice it when using it normally though, and it does not affect underglow at all.

&#x200B;

**GMK Olivia++ Kits, RAMA Enter- split into parts + shipping**

Just a bunch of unholy pandas that I have left over after making Holy YOK pandas for my friends, really want to get rid of these so just give me a price and I'll probably accept.

For sale today is my E-White 7v and my Geekark BoW Base + Accents.

**E-White 7v $900 Shipped / $850 Local (Atlanta)**

\-This 7v will be desoldered when sold. It will come with original packaging, desoldered PCB + PC Plate, and other accessories. The weight facing down has always been covered by plastic since it arrived to me. I applied a weight protector on it, but it is kinda scuffed with the air bubbles. The weight near the USB c port has some very slight scratches that can probably be buffed out. Overall 7v is in great condition. **Keycaps and Switches are not included!**

**Geekark BoW Base + Sea Salt Blue & Salmon Pink Accents $120 shipped / $110 Local (Atlanta)**

\- This set was used for maybe 2-3 months. Been sitting in my drawer for a while now so I would like to get rid of it. Will come with the base kit and 2 accent kits.

**Also, I am looking to purchase GMK Bingsu Hangul Alpha kit, so please PM if you are selling.**

1: The board. I bought this board a while back as my first 40% but have decided that the layout isn't for me. It's a prototype prime-e which came with only the red top. I 3d printed a black bottom, but had to split the bottom in half since my printer bed is pretty small. The print is a little uneven between the halves but nothing that's bothered me. I can provide the stl if you want to try a print yourself.

It's currently built with a hotswap pcb, clipped and lubed screw in cherry stabs, and 67g penguins lubed with 205+105 mix, springs with 105, and filmed with white tx films. (Tactile legs left unlubed). It also comes with 14 spare stock penguins, and 8 lubed which for some reason didn't take well to the lube. I've lubed several hundred switches and never had a switch be so finicky.

If you want them I can also include enough stock gat milky yellows to cover the board, since I have no other use for them.

$130 shipped CONUS. Does not come with keycaps.


2: GMK Jamon Ene Survival Kit. I thought I had lost this, and now that I've found it have no use for it. $70 shipped CONUS

**Prime\_Elise (Rose gold, hotswap)**

Can't get used to 40%. Comes with Brass plate and extra PCB. One of the PCBs is millmaxed (-> hotswappable). Looks really nice. (Note: this does *not* come with the keycaps in the timestamp picture) Also comes with wood wrist rest (Cherry).

[Geekhack thread](https://web.archive.org/web/20180703134842/https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=83442.0). One of the first custom keyboards that came with hotswap sockets. I am selling a Silver V1 (low profile) with a red plate. Layout B (which is rather unconventional).

It's actually quite a nice low-profile board. Almost not bezel to it. Here a [few photos with SA keycaps](https://imgur.com/a/p3Nmm) but it also looks quite good with GMK. Stabs need to be relubed (I can also do it .. for a small fee).

what's good everyone, putting up some of my more closely held keyboard items in search for a GMK ASCII kit:

# Have:

**RAMA x Keycult brass artisan keycaps**\- both black & white infills. Black infill has been mounted quite a few times and does not come with any packaging, white is completely sealed.

**CRP blue arabic**\- I believe this is an r2.2 kit; mounted a few times with little signs of use. Comes with numpad kit and original box

**Epbt SimpleJA**\- probably the most used kit of all my sets, still in pretty good condition (9/10) overall, and comes with a function kit that I never used. Will come in bags

# Want:

Currently on the hunt for a set of GMK ASCII- putting up these items for trade, whether it be both kits, or the artisans, or a mix- whatever can get a fair trade going. I'd also be down to buy a set if anybody is interested. Other than that, none of these items are for sale;

I'm new here as a seller, but I'm very active over on r/Watchexchange and have plenty of feedback there as a seller and buyer in case anyone wants to see that.

I have a very lightly used Alpine65 that I purchased from another redditor here about a month or so ago. I built it once with some glorious pandas and typed on it for a total of an hour, if that, before deciding it just wasn't for me and I'd rather sell it and use the funds to build something I'll end up with for longer. 

EDIT: The board was brand new and not built when I bought it. 

Album & Timestamp - [https://imgur.com/a/0yAoe60](https://imgur.com/a/0yAoe60)

Included:

Alpine65 Navy, in perfect condition

2 x Hotswap PCB (one is installed with glorious pandas and GMK Stabs, clipped and lubed, the other untouched and never opened)

1 x FR4 Plate (Installed)

1 x Brass plate, never touched, see pics

Gaskets and extra screw, as pictured

All pictured Glorious Pandas

All Pictured Stabs

Alpine65 Case, Outer Box and Slip. 

**Asking $675 via paypal, which includes shipping within the US. I will entertain reasonable offers.**

**Note that the switches and stabs ARE included**, and I really am not trying to sell those for profit here. I just don't use them and would rather them go to someone who will either use them or take the time to sell them separately. 

Pandas are lubed with G-Lube, Stabs are lubed with 205g0.

[Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/IibMUGp)

I  recently asked a jeweler friend of mine if she could make me some  custom keycaps. They are all Solid Cast Brass which has been oxidised  and then polished on the face of the key. The idea was to have dark  keycap with a pop of polished metal on top. They are Hand made and Hand  Polished so each Peice is unique

I have 4 Different kinds

**Skulls** \- 20 Units $70 p/p

**Compass** \- 20 Units $50 p/p

**Moon** \- 20 Units $50p/p

**Plain** \- 20 Units $30 p/p

the idea was for the plain ones to be Monogrammed by the Eventual owner (Lockdown in my city has stopped me doing this my self)

I also have some keebs, lube and Caps to let go

**Norbauer Heavy 9 In Veracity Steel**\- Desoldered with Sp Star x Kon Momo Tac Switches (205g0) Stabs lubed $3000 Aud Obo. Mint Condition with Original Packaging

**Stripe 60** \- Brass Plate, DZ60RGBv2 PCB, Stabs Clipped & Lubed,  Teal Tealios V2 $ 400 Obo

**Tofu65**  \- DZ65RGBv2 PCB, Zilents V2 (205g0), Cherry Stabs Clipped and Lubed. SA  Miami Nights Keycaps, Megatron Artisan (Can be sold with out keycaps)  $400 Obo

Keycaps

**GMK Laser R2 Cyberdeck** \- Sealed x1$200

Hey all! Today I have a few things for sale!

\-Jelly60 with hand polished weight(mirror finish). I love this board, and there is nothing wrong with it. It is barely used, but I am just not a fan of 60% or HHKB layout so I am looking to send it to a new home. The board has a solder PCB with L&F Cobalt POMS and C3 Stabs. I filled the base of the board with felt to make it sound more solid. I can provide additional pics on request! [SOUNDTEST](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13pU5FeNO8q8dzeYha0LhyhesSTl1ESCP/view)**Looking for: $300 USD + Shipping(I cover half)**

\*\*-\*\*ePBT Ivory. This is a Base set with Spacebars. I got them from MM from another user who said they are unused, and I only mounted them once and decided they just didn't fit the board I was wanting to put them on. **Looking for: $180 USD - Shipping included**

\-I am hoping to sell the Jelly60/ePBT Ivory as a combo and am looking for **$470 USD** to let both go!

\-Lubed and Filmed TKC Dragonfruits(x75). I think these switches are crazy underrated. I am a big linear person so I am not a huge fan of tactile, but these have been one of my favorite so far. They have been lubed with krytox 205g0 and 105 on springs. Filmed with deskeys. **Looking for $70 USD**

\-SMKeyboard Artisan Holder. Looking to let this go for 25 dollars. Taking a loss since I am including shipping. I impulse bought it for 25+8 dollar shipping, but found that I didn't have a use so I wanted to sell it for cheaper to someone who would actually use it. **Looking for $25 USD**

TLDR CHART:

|Item|Desc|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Jelly60|Hand polished to mirror finish. Soldered pcb with L&F cobalt poms and C3 Stabs|$~~350~~ 300 + Shipping(I cover half)|

I'm mostly looking to sell but potentially interested in the following for trades:

~~**D45 (E-gray), comes with EXTRA PCB and EXTRA FR4 Plate - $305**~~ pending

[**image album**](https://imgur.com/a/BYWaoTp)

Taking a small L on this one here, looking to raise some funds for projects. Will come with stabilizers already lubed. Comes with 2 PCBs, aluminum plate, and FR4 plate - if you are looking to buy a high end keyboard I highly suggest picking up an extra PCB to make sure you are futureproofing your overpriced keeb lol

If wanting to part, $265 for the D45 (alu plate), $55 for the PCB, $35 for the FR4 plate. Shipping TBD on postal code, ty.

I have a base kit available at the moment, may or may not decide to offer some child kits depending on what you have (Modern - Icon Mods, Aesthetic - Spacebars).

~~[**Polycarbonate O-ring / Gummy worm mount Prototype ALBUM**](https://imgur.com/a/4UO51lL)~~ WITHDRAWN
-

This is a one-off prototype that I have... had this made in the days before Bakeneko and the only friction-fit boards you could get were $1000+ on the aftermarket. Fitment is perfect, took me a few prototypes to arrive to this. Finish and condition is not as great (see pics), but I hear people can do some pretty nice touch ups to polycarbonate with common supplies. Comes with a case and 70a o-ring, no PCB included - it is compatible with the pretty easily-accessible [Hiney H60 (default JST position)](https://hineybush.com/collections/july-2021-restock/products/h60-preorder). It can take standard 60% plates. I can include a plate, but the switch cutouts are just a hair wider than needed and switches may not be entirely secure (won't be a problem when soldered IMO). Again, please see pics.

&nbsp;

**Zaku / Pinoko Switches**

I have 20 extra Zaku switches, and 30 extra Pinokos. Slim chance but hoping to trade these for some unused stabilizers (Durock V2 / C3 V2). PM if interested lol"

Hey all, got a set of NicePBT Sugarplum up for sale, I decided I have too many keycap sets. It's been used for a day but I just prefer my GMK sets over it. 

Asking **$90 shipped** - for reference, I bought this for $98 straight CK after shipping, and it is currently not in stock so I think this is a fair price. SOLD

CONUS only please, comment before PM. thanks!"

Only shipping to CONUSA. Happy to hear all offers, especially bundles.

* JTK Classic FC Child kits: brand new and un mounted. There are 2x Latin Alpha kits and ~~1x Spacebar Kit~~. Asking $50 shipped for each kit and willing to discount on bundles.

* MT3 Dev TTY TKL Kit: Standard TKL set. Everything is in good condition except for the the 2.25u left shift which has a injection flaw on one of the stabilizer stems. It has not been an issue for me mounting it but YMMV with different stabs. Selling as is for $40 shipped 

~~* GMK Art Clone Keycaps: Bought of aliexpress. Keycap quality is very nice IMO, but the bright white just didnt do it for me. These keycaps were only used for a couple of weeks and then put back into the box. Still in very good condition (also they are pbt). Asking $50 shipped in trays.~~

~~Tai Hao Keycap Sets. There is a Miami concrete base set cubic (with 1.75u shift), Avatar base set cubic (its the swirly green one with 1.75u shift) and a blue and pink one oem (standard base no extra shift). All are well used, probably have shine, but are totally functional since they are double shot. Asking $23 shipped each or $50 shipped for all three.~~"

Hello! I've been moving a lot recently so I'm trying to downsize. I have a board that I have loved but no longer need:

**Massdrop Alt (Low profile) - with stock keycaps but** ***without switches*** **- $100 + shipping OBO**

The board will come with upgraded stabs, I threw out the stock ones and replaced them with authentic pre-retool GMK stabs, lubed and clipped. I'm not selling the switches because I repurposed some of the stock switches in other projects after I swapped in new switches, so I have hardly any of the stock switches left, and I'm keeping the switches that I had replaced them with for another build. I will sell the stock keycaps though as I have no need for them. They are undamaged but the spacebar came slightly warped, though that is normal for PBT spacebars. It doesn't affect typing. Anyway, the board is undamaged except for one scratch on the underside by one of the screws (see the photo album).

Definitely pm me on discord if you prefer for faster response times: chill389cc#1920

I will be shipping to the continental USA, **Priority Mail fully insured**. Thank you!"

Purchased from a user who made these switches by inserting both the leaf and stem of dragonfruit switches into smoky housings of a durock linear, essentially making them a recolor. The bright white stems contrast really nicely with the smoky housings, I just don't like them as much as my linears. Lubed with tribosys 3204. Does not come with the container pictured.

I'm selling a brand new and sealed GMK Future Funk Base Kit. ~~Looking to sell for $260 Shipped CONUS only.~~ **SOLD for asking**

Only shipping to CONUSA. Happy to hear all offers, especially bundles.

* JTK Classic FC Child kits: brand new and un mounted. There are 2x Latin Alpha kits and 1x Spacebar Kit. Asking $50 shipped for each kit and willing to discount on bundles.

~~* MT3 Dev TTY TKL Kit: Standard TKL set. Everything is in good condition except for the the 2.25u left shift which has a injection flaw on one of the stabilizer stems. It has not been an issue for me mounting it but YMMV with different stabs. Selling as is for $40 shipped~~ 

~~* GMK Art Clone Keycaps: Bought of aliexpress. Keycap quality is very nice IMO, but the bright white just didnt do it for me. These keycaps were only used for a couple of weeks and then put back into the box. Still in very good condition (also they are pbt). Asking $50 shipped in trays.~~

* ~~Zilent Frankenstein Switches: Zilent stems, gateron blue ink housing, aliaz 70g springs, tx films. Only the springs were lubed to reduce spring ping. Have an interested sharp feel, but even for ""silent"" stems the tactile leaf has too much noise for me (silent linear user). There are 88 switches and asking $45 shipped for them.~~

~~* Tai Hao Keycap Sets. There is a Miami concrete base set cubic (with 1.75u shift), Avatar base set cubic (its the swirly green one with 1.75u shift) and a blue and pink one oem (standard base no extra shift). All are well used, probably have shine, but are totally functional since they are double shot. Asking $23 shipped each or $50 shipped for all three.~~

* ~~HK Gaming BoW Keycap Set. Their full base kit (which has extra keys like short shift). Good used condition, I just have too many sets and these bright white sets aren't really doing it for me. Asking $30 shipped.~~"

We're currently in strict lockdown where I'm located so it might take a little more time for me to get the package shipped.

**Everything will be shipped via DHL express (\~3 days), I got some more accurate quotes back from DHL, hence the edits.**

* Keyboard = ~~Around $80 - $100 (US)~~ $75 (US)
* Keycaps = ~~Around $40 - $50 (US)~~ $45 (US) - $35 (SG)

I will get an exact quote from DHL once I have the location of the buyer, but expect it to be similar to these estimates. I know these shipping prices sound outrageous, but I really can't do much about it sorry :((

Hi all, am looking to sell one of my keyboards, the NK65 EE Blumen. 

~~It has box jades and HK gaming keycaps. There is a small damage in the PC on one of the corners. I tried my best to get it in the picture. Also on the PCB one of the hotswap sockets popped off, but I soldered it back, thought it would be important to mention(-_ key) Will sell this with keycaps and switches for $140+shipping. If you don’t want the keycaps and switches I can lower the price(100+shipping)~~


I’m also looking to get a GMK set classic blue blue base, Godspeed Columbia, or belafonte. Can pay with PayPal or trade NK65.

Thanks for looking!

**~~Comment before PM, chat will be ignored.~~**

**~~Option 1: BUILT W/ NO EXTRAS OR CAPS~~**

* ~~Black 7V~~
* ~~PCB 1 - Built w/ Durock POMs (Lubed 205g0 and spring swapped w/ 67g TX Long) , built on Aluminum Plate without PCB foam (I like clacky noises).~~
* ~~Durock V2 Screw In Stabs (205g0)~~

~~Condition of everything: Case is near mint. Besides normal swirls, the back weight has a couple micro scratches (only one being fairly visible) from a few weeks of use. No gashes, pitting, heavy scratching. The POMs w/ the 67g spring swap sound dreamy! Without the PCB foam, it doesn't lose it's signature sound (similar to creams), which I like. Ashes looks incredible on this build.~~

Hello! Hope you guys are doing well!

I have some GMK sets, Artisan and Ramas up for sale today.

I am looking to donate some cash from this sale to a local cat rescuer, can view her instagram at [.@fioloh](https://www.instagram.com/fioloh/?hl=en). She has been helping many stray cats/dogs (mainly cats) find homes, seek medical help (including surgeries) as well as helping to foster. I found her work really meaningful (especially because I like cats). Hence, I'll state 2 prices (just $10 difference), if you would like to help, you can opt to purchase the slightly more expensive price, it's perfectly okay if you don't want to. The donation will be publicly recorded at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asY5BAWSZ_pmxUy2jxmaSa1eHDddTiLQlEhGi1niuyw/edit#gid=1722981492), under tehbingg. (I hope this is allowed by the mods, otherwise please let me know, I'll be willing to remove.) Prior donations from previous sales have been made (can be seen in the spreadsheet).

I can provide more photos of any of the items upon request:) All of the items have **no shine** and are as good as new. All prices to not include shipping.

This would not be FCFS as I would like to prioritize the donation prices to help a little more.

Hey there MechMarket. I am selling my GMK Penumbra set, Drop Alt Keyboard, and Red Samurai Cable. I don't have Red Samurai anymore and haven't been using the cable at all. I no longer use the Penumbra set since I have a different set I enjoy much more, and same thing goes for the Drop ALT. Since I am no longer using them, I am looking to sell them. GMK Penumbra is Pending! out of them shipped since it is the entire kit plus the solarized set. As for the Drop Alt, I am looking for just $100 shipped since it won't be coming with switches and will just be the keyboard and the cable. And for the Red Samurai Cable, I have no clue. Just send me an offer and I'll think about it. I really just don't want it, so I'll just end up taking whatever the highest offer is on it. It was poorly made and needs to be re coiled or something, I know nothing about how to fix why it is so uneven. Thanks for reading!"

~~Hi~~ r/mm\~\~!\~\~

~~It's been a while since I've posted but today I'm looking to part with this set that has served me well over the past few months.~~

~~The kit does have some shine on the alphas (Sadly, I play a lot of league of legends) and I do have the box which I will ship if I sell to someone in the UK. If the buyer is outside of UK I'll put the caps in bags for cheaper postage costs.~~

~~Anyone who I've dealt with knows I don't sell for flip prices and would really love this set to go to someone who hasn't had the chance to use a GMK set before. So, if this applies to you reach out to me preferably on discord: Truepower#4931~~

~~Any queries please don't hesitate to ask. And if anyone reading this wants to trade and DMGs get in touch!!!~~

~~Mods, it's been a while since I posted so if I missed something, apologies in advance!~~

~~GMK DMG Base + Spacebars Kit: £150 + PP~~

I'm not holding my breath - but if you are in the Central/North Puget sound and are interested we can figure this out! [Timestamp Link](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Mfew4hHyzZWrpNLt6)

**For Trade:**   
Up for **trade** is an original GMK Nautilus keycap set, on a KBDFans 19x board, with i think zilents.  Also there is a HWS Otter (believe its colorway is Polaris) that i think matches quite well. All of this is your for the low price of your Scotty Downrigger! 

Based on recent sales - it seems like this combo should be a pretty fair trade for a used downrigger... if anyone actually has this we can work out details and i can get you more pics... really im not expecting to be sending this out, but this is my least favorite Nautical themed set i own... so it made sense to offer it out.   TRADE ONLY.   


**For Sale:**   
~~Brand new, still sealed even has a nice layer of dust on the plastic.  includes both the base kit and signs kit.  This was one of the last group buys i entered and havent been super involved since then.  $300 shipped for the set - can go out in the mail as early as today!~~ sold for $290"

Hello all,

I guess this is more of a buying post, but I’m looking to offload a few items to help fund my endgame as well. I love the hobby, but am ready to just enjoy a board for a long while: 

Built Devastating TKL by CannonKeys - 

Edit: SOLD for $265 

Slate blue. Excellent condition. Built with L+F Gateron Black Inks and Creams. Comes with CK TKL carrying case! 

Dwarf Factory Moondust Artisan -

$65 shipped CONUS -

Mounted for a couple days/pictures. In original box. 

WANTS:

I’m willing to trade for, or outright buy a few different keyboards. I’m interested in a lot. I’m looking around the $600-$700 range. It doesn’t matter if it’s built or unbuilt, but if it is built, a few extras/options are preferred. 60% 65% and TKL highly preferred. Not super interested in polycarbonates, but who knows. I can also potentially trade GMK sets towards the right board too. 

Please comment and then PM so we can work something out!"

Hello, friend.

**UK/EU ONLY. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE EITHER OF OUR TIME ENQUIRING IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE OF THIS REGION. PLEASE COMMENT BELOW AFTER PMING, NO CHATS.**

**If you have any questions, please let me know and i'd be happy to help!**

I am selling a variety of L&F Switches along with my beloved Tofu65, all listed below.

Switches, all have been broken in after a month or so of usage. Lubed and filmed as listed below;

&#x200B;

|L&F Creampaca x 60|Mounted once on a hot-swap board. JWK Seal housing (same as the Alpacas, literally just a different color), NovelKey Cream Stem. Lubed with Krytox 205g0 on the stem, 105 on the springs. Filmed with Deskey films.|66GBP (Includes postage)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|L&F Milky Tealios (v2) x 68|Mounted once on a hot-swap board. Tealios switches (v2) with a milky yellow gateron top housing. Spring swapped to 72g SPRiT slow springs. Lubed with Krytox 205g0 on the housing, 105g0 on the springs. Filmed with TX 0.15mm black films|65GBP (Includes postage)|
|L&F MX Hyperglide Black x 81|Mounted a few times across several boards. They are the latest revision of MX Black switches (hyperglides). Have been broken in for a couple of months now, all are lubed with Krytox 205g0 and filmed with TX Black 0.15mm films. Springs have been swapped to SPRiT 72g Slow springs.|52GBP (Includes postage)|

&#x200B;

* Voice65 POM Plate - **34GBP (includes postage)**

This literally came through today from ProtoTypist. As I have sold my Voice 65 since then, I have no use for this. The plate has all the relevant counter sunk screw holes and the leafs for the gasket mount needed for the board. Just looking to make my money back on this.

&#x200B;

* ~~HotKeysProject Hannya Darkness -~~ **~~22GBP (includes postage)~~**

~~Comes with the original little case it was shipped in - in perfect condition, a great match to GMK Red Samurai.~~  SOLD FOR ASKING

&#x200B;

* Burgundy Tofu65 with GMK Red Samurai Keycaps - **250GBP (Includes postage) or OBO**

This board is perfect for anyone getting into the scene, get your first GMK keycap set along with a very decent sounding board all in one package.

[Sound test of this exact board can be found on my video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5Inkwkt7BY)

Used this board for close to 3/4 months now. Package includes;

* Tofu65 Burgundy (has one minor mark on the front, barely visible to the point where I struggled to get a picture of it, otherwise it's in very good condition and will come fully built). Comes with a brass weight on the back.
* GMK Red Samurai Keycaps (little to no shine, I have tried to demonstrate this in the images. **You will only receive the keycaps pictured on the board!**)
* Durock Stabilisers v1 (lubed with 205g0 and dielectric grease, holee modded)
* SP Star Grey switches to cover the board (Lubed with Krytox 205g0 and filmed with TX 0.15mm)
* DZ65 v2 RGB Hotswap PCB
* DZ65 Case Foam
* Brass plate (with KBDFANs Module Foam on - this can be removed easily by yourself after purchase if wanted)
* O-Ring mounts for the screw holes
* Sorbothane to go inside the case"

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered/linked to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation thus for trade PM is needed.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-80 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus the one I recommend (FEDEX/DHL) generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster. I recently added an option to choose slow shipping option, but I don't recommend it for expensive items (its like USPS) - choose this for those at your own risk.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct.
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay, but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *IMPORTANT NEWS*
* On August 2nd paypal announced to increase paypal (goods & services) fee from 2.9% (4.4% int.) to 3.49% (4.99% int) on August 2, fixed fee increases too. To keep ir simple, prices will increase by 0.6% accordingly for most products after this date. Prices will be updated and this notice will be left for a while to explain the slight increase. Recommend not to wait and buy before this date to save some bucks.
* *If you have any questions, write something like* **""I have a question, pm""** *and ask it* **PM** *not here .* **All other comments** *which are not refering to PM on post are* **IGNORED** *(unless commenter is mod) and if they happens to be threadcapping (something like: ""lower the price"" ""because I want to sell my own set and threadcap your post so your would be ignored"") or toxic - reported. Thank you for your understanding <3*"

To make it easier for buyers:

\- Shipping prices in eu generally are 4-15 euros (depends on various reasons (if it untracked or tracked), how big is the package)

\- Shipping prices to usa/canada generally are 20-70 (depends on various reasons, mostly size and weight affects price exponentially)

\- PRICE<60 € is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € for tracked;

\- 60=<PRICE<100 € (or just generally heavy) is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € - 3.5 € for tracked (unless listed otherwise)

\- PRICE=>100+ € items is sent via tracked/registered mail (unless asked otherwise);

\- Shipping to UK due to new regulations increase by roughly 3-5e (just add 3-5e to current EU price), but priority is EU > UK > Other.

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered/linked to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation thus for trade PM is needed.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-80 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus the one I recommend (FEDEX/DHL) generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster. I recently added an option to choose slow shipping option, but I don't recommend it for expensive items (its like USPS) - choose this for those at your own risk.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct.
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay, but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *IMPORTANT NEWS*
* On August 2nd paypal announced to increase paypal (goods & services) fee from 2.9% (4.4% int.) to 3.49% (4.99% int) on August 2, fixed fee increases too. To keep ir simple, prices will increase by 0.6% accordingly for most products after this date. Prices will be updated and this notice will be left for a while to explain the slight increase. Recommend not to wait and buy before this date to save some bucks.
* *If you have any questions, write something like* **""I have a question, pm""** *and ask it* **PM** *not here .* **All other comments** *which are not refering to PM on post are* **IGNORED** *(unless commenter is mod) and if they happens to be threadcapping (something like: ""lower the price"" ""because I want to sell my own set and threadcap your post so your would be ignored"") or toxic - reported. Thank you for your understanding <3*"

|[Mode Eighty First Edition - Dark WKL](https://imgur.com/a/bu4rtwP)|The original top piece is switched out to a Deco WKL as the original First Edition only came with a standard WK one. The shiny PVD bottom is gorgeous af and it's one of my favorite sounding boards. The top case is flawless but the bottom has two light scratches. Comes with a hotswap PCB and FR4 plate as well as the carrying case and all foams. Note that there is an upcoming in-stock drop for the Eighty but it doesn't include the 1E as it was limited and retailed for more (I'm essentially selling at retail). I'm also open to trading for an F1-8X WKL with pp on my end.|$750/Trade for F1-8X WKL|

I didn't find it as useful as I thought but the RGB looks nice. Still available at SpaceCables so I'm selling for original cost + mill-max + shipping.~~|~~$87~~ Sold for $80 Locally|

The switches have a very nice thocky profile with hints of clack and are really smooth to boot. Housing and stems were lubed with 205g0, springs with GPL 105, and filmed with KBDFans clear PC films.|$55|

If you’re looking to skip right to a grail build, this is it. Vega 65 hotswap in great condition, can send any other pictures of the case along if requested. I sourced the switch components directly from Gazzew and assembled/lubed them to his specifications. The caps are in great condition with no shine, and the Weed Cha keypora matches really well. The matching cable has no signs of wear, and the coil is in like-new condition. I’ll also throw in a Leopold 65% carry bag that fits everything perfectly. 

Not sure how to price this, so I’ll ask for **1200**, but feel free to send offers.

Hi mates, I have to sell my all-time favorite board due to recent stock market turmoil.

Grey Constellation 65 is in **excellent** condition without any dents or scratches.

* Built with 1.5 mm brass plate, L&F OA switches, cherry screw-in stabs.
* Two extra L&F OA switches
* extra brand new PCB
* o-ring
* brass accents
* top-mount screws
* Rama AE keycaps (Brass)
* AE hard carrying case including a cloth
* I have GMK spirit base keycaps ([link](https://kono.store/products/gmk-spirit-keycap-set?variant=31470059520083)) set mounted on the board and I believe it looks fantastic. The keycaps set shines a little due to manufacturing. (Optional)

More accents and plates will be restocked soon on [keyboardtreehouse.com](https://keyboardtreehouse.com) if you need more extras.

\- Shipping prices to usa/canada generally are 20-70 (depends on various reasons, mostly size and weight affects price exponentially)

\- PRICE<60 € is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € for tracked;

\- 60=<PRICE<100 € (or just generally heavy) is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € - 3.5 € for tracked (unless listed otherwise)

\- PRICE=>100+ € items is sent via tracked/registered mail (unless asked otherwise);

\- Shipping to UK due to new regulations increase by roughly 3-5e (just add 3-5e to current EU price), but priority is EU > UK > Other.

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered/linked to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation thus for trade PM is needed.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-80 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus the one I recommend (FEDEX/DHL) generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster. I recently added an option to choose slow shipping option, but I don't recommend it for expensive items (its like USPS) - choose this for those at your own risk.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct.
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay, but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *IMPORTANT NEWS* 
* On August 2nd paypal announced to increase paypal (goods & services) fee from 2.9% (4.4% int.) to 3.49% (4.99% int) on August 2, fixed fee increases too. To keep ir simple, prices will increase by 0.6% accordingly for most products after this date. Prices will be updated and this notice will be left for a while to explain the slight increase. Recommend not to wait and buy before this date to save some bucks.
* *If you have any questions, write something like* **""I have a question, pm""** *and ask it* **PM** *not here .* **All other comments** *which are not refering to PM on post are* **IGNORED** *(unless commenter is mod) and if they happens to be threadcapping (something like: ""lower the price"" ""because I want to sell my own set and threadcap your post so your would be ignored"") or toxic - reported. Thank you for your understanding <3*"

Some of the stems are crooked and it is possible that it causes incompatibility on some keyboards. However, besides a couple stems being slightly crooked (see the D key), I had no issues with typing on either of my keyboards (Polaris and F1). See album for how it looks (don't mind the incorrect row height Pg Dn key that I didn't notice until now). Used for a few months, so there is a noticeable bit of use on keys like S. Note that the R1 did not include an F13 key, and the stems are not as uniformly tight as R2. **Accent kits do not have arrows.**"

Evening,

**UK/EU ONLY. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE EITHER OF OUR TIME ENQUIRING IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE OF THIS REGION. PLEASE COMMENT BELOW AFTER PMING, NO CHATS.**

I am selling a variety of L&F Switches along with my beloved Tofu65, all listed below.

Switches, all have been broken in after a month or so of usage. Lubed and filmed as listed below;

&#x200B;

|L&F Creampaca x 60|Mounted once on a hot-swap board. JWK Seal housing (same as the Alpacas, literally just a different color), NovelKey Cream Stem. Lubed with Krytox 205g0 on the stem, 105 on the springs. Filmed with Deskey films.|62GBP + Postage|
|:-|:-|:-|
|L&F Milky Tealios (v2) x 68|Mounted once on a hot-swap board. Tealios switches (v2) with a milky yellow gateron top housing. Spring swapped to 72g SPRiT slow springs. Lubed with Krytox 205g0 on the housing, 105g0 on the springs. Filmed with TX 0.15mm black films|60GBP + Postage|
|L&F MX Hyperglide Black x 81|Mounted a few times across several boards. They are the latest revision of MX Black switches (hyperglides). Have been broken in for a couple of months now, all are lubed with Krytox 205g0 and filmed with TX Black 0.15mm films. Springs have been swapped to SPRiT 72g Slow springs.|50GBP + Postage|

&#x200B;

* Voice65 POM Plate - **30GBP + Postage**

This literally came through today from ProtoTypist. As I have sold my Voice 65 since then, I have no use for this. The plate has all the relevant counter sunk screw holes and the leafs for the gasket mount needed for the board. Just looking to make my money back on this.

&#x200B;

* HotKeysProject Hannya Darkness - **20GBP + Shipping**

Comes with the original little case it was shipped in - in perfect condition, a great match to GMK Red Samurai.

* Burgundy Tofu65 with GMK Red Samurai Keycaps - **230GBP + Postage**

**PLEASE BE PREPARED FOR LARGER SHIPPING COSTS THAN NORMAL AS THIS BOARD IS HEAVY.**

This board is perfect for anyone getting into the scene, get your first GMK keycap set along with a very decent sounding board all in one package.

[Sound test of this exact board can be found on my video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5Inkwkt7BY)

Used this board for close to 3/4 months now. Package includes;

* Tofu65 Burgundy (has one minor mark on the front, barely visible to the point where I struggled to get a picture of it, otherwise it's in very good condition and will come fully built). Comes with a brass weight on the back.
* GMK Red Samurai Keycaps (little to no shine, I have tried to demonstrate this in the images. **You will only receive the keycaps pictured on the board!**)
* Durock Stabilisers v1 (lubed with 205g0 and dielectric grease, holee modded)
* SP Star Grey switches to cover the board (Lubed with Krytox 205g0 and filmed with TX 0.15mm)
* DZ65 v2 RGB Hotswap PCB
* DZ65 Case Foam
* Brass plate (with KBDFANs Module Foam on - this can be removed easily by yourself after purchase if wanted)
* O-Ring mounts for the screw holes
* Sorbothane to go inside the case"

**ALL BUT KEYCAPS AND CABLE ARE SOLD**

Hey guys, I’ve got a full build I’m trying to move along. This is an Arctic Blue Drop CTRL with some goodies to go with it. This is a fantastic keyboard for someone who’s just starting out in the hobby or for anyone really. It actually feels great to type on and has a nice sound to it.

Here’s the breakdown of what’s included, also showing price for what I paid for everything (for transparency):

- Arctic Blue Drop CTRL (hotswap, RGB lighting, $200)
- StupidFish foam set (both pcb and case, $30)
- Alpaca V2 linear switches, lubed and filmed ($85, very nice thock sound)
- Genuine cherry plate-mounted stabs, clipped and lubed, which are way better than stock stabs ($11)
- PBT Mizu (not GMK, will also include the rest of the keycaps too, $70)
- Custom coiled cable to match ($60)

Everything adds up to roughly $450, before shipping/taxes/etc.

I’m looking to get $350 + shipping for everything. I have an unused TKL/80% hard carrying case that I can add on for another $30. Local to LA/OC. Thanks for looking."

ITEM | PRICE | NOTES| PICTURES

GSKT-00 Silver WKL |$875 OBO or trades | Built with super smooth vint blacks on a half alu plate and OG PCB. I don't know what weight the springs are, but they're like 50g or something really light like that. Board is in good condition overall, but there is a scratch on the corner that's fairly visible. Comes with an extra ABS full plate and some extra vints | [Scratch](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/831950412826279946/864626700759334932/20210713_114007.jpg) and [bonus pic with Boba Fett on it](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/831950412826279946/864587845956009984/20210713_114030.jpg) 
~~scuffed Polaris WK~~ | ~~$325 OBO or trades~~ | ~~It's a completely functional Polaris with an e-black weight, L/F Alpacas on a PC half plate, and an extra alu plate. However the part that makes it scuffed is that the previous owner spray painted it and the texture on that job is not holding up well. The previous owner recommended that it's not worth it to go back into the PCB, it doesn't need to be bridged or anything, but it's been soldered/desoldered a *lot*.  Also the ESC key has a holy panda in it, and the top right key has a u stem H1~~ | ~~[Mark 1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/135615568525918209/865372422215172106/20210715_162028.jpg), [Mark 2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/135615568525918209/865372423104888832/20210715_162023.jpg), and [back picture](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/135615568525918209/865372432373907506/20210715_162017.jpg)~~

Hi guys,

I'm looking to sell some keyboards I've purchased over the last year. I would only be looking to sell in the UK.

None of these keyboards are built and have only been removed from packaging in order to take the photos.

I didn't order any extras with any of these items so they are all the base keeb/keycap set.

Prices include Paypal fees.

KBD67MKII, used for a few months, PC version, HS PCB, Brass plate, pretty good state overall, Durock stabs, alpaca switches with milky tops, SA green white - 400Euros

Drop CTRL- barebones 150Euros, not used much, I had bought it for the office before Covid, and then never returned to the office again, after just 2 months of daily use. now I use it just one in a while...

Acrilic top cover - 30euros

Alpine 65 - I had a problem with the screws the first time I build the board, the screws were too long, and I had to screw them really firmly, otherwise the top and bottom would have a gap between them... Don't know why this was... long story short, when unscrewing, the screws got stripped, and it was a mess to remove.. there are pictures of how it became, some flaws on the screw holes... the brass plate seems to have a couple of small scratches... I am selling for 430Euros (I had to pay 100euros of customs fees) so it's still a bit lowered that the price I paid. I can include switches and keycaps if you want... HS pcb, FR4 plate

60% Glorious wrist rest - 35Euros

Switches:

alpaca v2 - 70 lubbed and filmed - 50 euros

Durock L7 - 70 lubbed and filment- 50euros

Hey all!

Getting rid of some keycap sets that I have never used and have no intention on using. Loved them when I bought them but never had the right board.

**Olivia++** R2 Bundle ***NOT SPLITTING*** **SOLD for asking**

Olivia Light Base Kit (Unsealed, never mounted, never used)

Olivia Dark Base Kit (Unsealed, mounted once for photos, never used)

O++ Spacebars (Unsealed, 7u mounted once, never used)

O++ Novelties (Sealed)

O++ Extension (Sealed)

O++ Light Desk Mat (unrolled a couple of times for photos, never used)

O++ Dark Desk Mat (unrolled a couple times for photos, never used)

Total Bundle Price: **$875 shipped** **SOLD for asking**

Again, I am ***NOT*** splitting this bundle. This is for someone who wants to splurge on what is an unused and basically new O++ bundle. 

**GMK Noel Base kit** (Unsealed, never mounted or used, tray is damage from shipping but I will include it) - $350 shipped ****SOLD FOR $325****

# Crazy Rare Artisans

I'm not sure how to price these since I've never seen sold for $ on mechmarket. The Lasik Keypora is special to me because it's so perfect for SA/GMK Laser, but since there were only <10 made (I think), I feel like it needs to visit other people.

Hi all,

Hope everyone is staying safe and healthy!

I have a couple things that I am looking to sell.

Price includes shipping and Paypal fees.

Shipping is done through USPS Mail with tracking for the Continental US. Preference is Continental US.

&#x200B;

|Description|Price|Status|
|:-|:-|:-|
|~~TMOv2 PC plate and PCB~~|~~$100~~|~~Sold~~|
|~~KAT Arctic (try to keep them all in one sale for now)~~|~~$300~~|~~Sold for $260~~|
|~~Grey TX-CP v1~~|~~$500 OBO~~|~~Sold for asking~~|

**Details:**

**TMOv2 PC plate and PCB**

* Both are brand new
* 1 PCB in sealed anti-static bag
* 1 PC plate

**KAT Arctic**

* All kit sare still sealed in the packaging
* There are alphas, modifiers, beluga, numpad, spacebar, and blue split kit
* I try not to split them for now, hopefully someone will take the whole package.

**Grey TX-CP v1**

* This was my favorite work keyboard for a couple of years.
* It was built by kin himself, he sourced vintage black switches, swapped them with 55g springs, lubed them, and uses GMK screw in stabilizers.  He also put in switch LEDs (when that was a thing back in the day).
* Built with brass plate, and it has a brass weight that does not patina.  Will also ship with the TX carrying case(bag).
* I have posted a couple pictures of scratches, nicks on the keyboard.  It is not too bad to be honest.  I never dropped the board, just battle scar from daily use in the office.

**Additional Info:**

* Not FCFS, no bidding, please be nice and fair.
* Price listed includes PayPal fees + shipping to the continental US.  Due to the current pandemic, I will try to avoid shipping international.  Hope you understand.

Please post here prior to PM.  Do not message me via reddit chat.  They will be kindly ignored."

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered/linked to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation thus for trade PM is needed.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-80 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus the one I recommend (FEDEX/DHL) generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster. I recently added an option to choose slow shipping option, but I don't recommend it for expensive items (its like USPS) - choose this for those at your own risk.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct.
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay, but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *IMPORTANT NEWS* 
* On August 2nd paypal announced to increase paypal (goods & services) fee from 2.9% (4.4% int.) to 3.49% (4.99% int) on August 2, fixed fee increases too. To keep ir simple, prices will increase by 0.6% accordingly for most products after this date. Prices will be updated and this notice will be left for a while to explain the slight increase. Recommend not to wait and buy before this date to save some bucks.
* *If you have any questions, write something like* **""I have a question, pm""** *and ask it* **PM** *not here .* **All other comments** *which are not refering to PM on post are* **IGNORED** *(unless commenter is mod) and if they happens to be threadcapping (something like: ""lower the price"" ""because I want to sell my own set and threadcap your post so your would be ignored"") or toxic - reported. Thank you for your understanding <3*"

Hi,

Selling some stuff that I've gathered as my goal in this hobby is more functional and not to collect too much. The plan is to sell everything close to at cost + shipping. Prices below do not include shipping. CONUS only.

&#x200B;

|Item|Price|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
|~~NK65 Entry Smoke~~|$110 + Shipping|Used for about 4 months and sat on my desk the entire time. Switches went in and out 5 times max while testing various switches. Will come with everything it came with originally.|
|~~90x Gazzew Boba U4 Silent Tactile Switches~~|$70 + Shipping|I bought these as a test between these switches and T1 switches and decided to use the T1 switches so a few of the switches have been used for maybe 5 minutes. Have not been lubed.|
|~~ePBT Doubleshot ABS Cherry Keycaps~~|$100 + Shipping|Used for 3 months before I finally got my GMK set. These were purchased from TKC, so you can also find images/renders there.|
|Durock Smokey Stabs (2u x4, 6.25u x1)|$30 + Shipping|Completely unused, but this is more of a hail mary because I don't know why you wouldn't want to just buy brand new ones from Durock themselves. They do not even fit on the NK65 Entry.|

This set essentially makes up a keyboard (albeit with a some extra switches) so if interested, I can bundle everything together and knock 30 dollars off of the 3 relevant items ($250 + Shipping). Despite not fitting on the board, if you're interested in bundling the Durock stabs with everything I'll knock off an additional 10 dollars ( $270 + Shipping)

I will prioritize sale discussions with parties that are interested in purchasing it as a bundle.

&#x200B;

I would prefer payments to be through Venmo or Zelle but I am OK with using paypal if that is what you prefer. (editted as I realized that I have indeed used paypal before for r/mm)

Also, I am in the Boston so if you're willing to drive over to the Allston area I can meet you at a CVS and hand it off to you there for cash/venmo/zelle.

&#x200B;

Feel free to PM if there are any questions, anything wrong with my post, or if you're interested :D"

**Unholy Pandas - $0.15 per switch OBO + $5 shipping**

Just a bunch of unholy pandas that I have left over after making Holy YOK pandas for my friends, really want to get rid of these so just give me a price and I'll probably accept. You can also buy in bulk for very cheap - I have a ton. These are just some cheap linears made with Halo Clear housings + springs and a YOK Trash panda stem.

Hello everyone! sorta weird post today. 

 I would like to trade my limited run mini sheepdog in Odin Heim damasteel, #228 out of 250. I am the 3rd owner and just received it no longer than a week ago, just isn't for me so trying to get back what I bought it for. The previous owner carried it once and used it to open a single box. I have only flicked it open a couple times, it has been safe inside its cloth and case. It's in amazing condition, with the only damage being a couple small marks on the clip. The marks aren't very visible at most angles. I'd give it a [B] rating for seeing a little use while being in great shape. Comes with the box and all the goodies inside. 
Trade Value: $350 


Trades interests:
- Any red GMK sets (prefer spacebar kit but not necessary) 

- GMK bleached base and spacebar kit 

- Other GMK sets with spacebar :) 

Please comment before PM. 

Thanks:)"

If you need extra space bars for Alice layouts or a 2u spacebar, lmk. I don't have a full spacebar kit but we could possibly make something work.

GMK Bingsu base kit. 40s kit would also be nice but not a requirement, willing to work out a deal if you have it. Preference to non-sealed.

I'd prefer to not ship in the GMK tray only to make shipping cheaper and easier, but can work something out if you need the tray.

GMK Bleached Base + Keypad/ISO|Never mounted or typed on. |$210|~~Yes~~ No
Pearl blue Kira 80 WKL|""Poseidon blue"" plate. 'Kira' logo on plate is not mirrored FWIW. PCB is de-soldered and tested working by bridging the pads after de-soldering. No external blemishes or nicks that I can see. *For some reason I received it from the group buy with nine socket head screws and three flat head screws, but there are eight internal and eight external threaded holes.* (Not including screws for mounting weights) I recommend just buying more screws, but it goes together fine with the included hardware. Unfinished brass weight has some natural tarnish. Rare keyboard with a classic profile.|$800|Yes
Black LZ PhysiX|Two PCBs, one black plate, black wrist rest. Surface is blemish free. One PCB will have trace lube from stabilizers, but was never soldered. All original hardware is included, I applied the black bumpons.|$700|Yes

I am going out of town for a week on the 17th, so there may be that much delay in shipping if I can't ship it out before then. Thanks for your interest."

Mainly shined on gamer keys. (Yes, I made sure to clean them and can ensure they are gamer gunk free.) Don't have the tray for the set.

Hello!

**UK/EU ONLY. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE EITHER OF OUR TIME ENQUIRING IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE OF THIS REGION. PLEASE COMMENT BELOW AFTER PMING, NO CHATS.**

I am selling a variety of L&F Switches along with my beloved Tofu65, all listed below.

Switches, all have been broken in after a month or so of usage. Lubed and filmed as listed below;

&#x200B;

|L&F Creampaca x 60|Mounted once on a hot-swap board. JWK Seal housing (same as the Alpacas, literally just a different color), NovelKey Cream Stem. Lubed with Krytox 205g0 on the stem, 105 on the springs. Filmed with Deskey films.|62GBP + Postage|
|:-|:-|:-|
|L&F Milky Tealios (v2) x 68|Mounted once on a hot-swap board. Tealios switches (v2) with a milky yellow gateron top housing. Spring swapped to 72g SPRiT slow springs. Lubed with Krytox 205g0 on the housing, 105g0 on the springs. Filmed with TX 0.15mm black films|60GBP + Postage|
|L&F MX Hyperglide Black x 81|Mounted a few times across several boards. They are the latest revision of MX Black switches (hyperglides). Have been broken in for a couple of months now, all are lubed with Krytox 205g0 and filmed with TX Black 0.15mm films. Springs have been swapped to SPRiT 72g Slow springs.|50GBP + Postage|

* Voice65 POM Plate - **35GBP + Postage**

This literally came through today from ProtoTypist. As I have sold my Voice 65 since then, I have no use for this. The plate has all the relevant counter sunk screw holes and the leafs for the gasket mount needed for the board. Just looking to make my money back on this.

* HotKeysProject Hannya Darkness - **15GBP + Shipping**

Comes with the original little case it was shipped in - in perfect condition, a great match to GMK Red Samurai.

&#x200B;

* Burgundy Tofu65 with GMK Red Samurai Keycaps - **240GBP + Postage**

**PLEASE BE PREPARED FOR LARGER SHIPPING COSTS THAN NORMAL AS THIS BOARD IS HEAVY.**

This board is perfect for anyone getting into the scene, get your first GMK keycap set along with a very decent sounding board all in one package.

[Sound test of this exact board can be found on my video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5Inkwkt7BY)

Used this board for close to 3/4 months now. Package includes;

* Tofu65 Burgundy (has one minor mark on the front, barely visible to the point where I struggled to get a picture of it, otherwise it's in very good condition and will come fully built). Comes with a brass weight on the back.
* GMK Red Samurai Keycaps (little to no shine, I have tried to demonstrate this in the images. **You will only receive the keycaps pictured on the board!**)
* Durock Stabilisers v1 (lubed with 205g0 and dielectric grease, holee modded)
* SP Star Grey switches to cover the board (Lubed with Krytox 205g0 and filmed with TX 0.15mm)

* DZ65 Case Foam
* Brass plate (with KBDFANs Module Foam on - this can be removed easily by yourself after purchase if wanted)

Good Morning /r/mechmarket 

**DINGHY AND KETCH PCB ARE GONE AS WELL AS ALL THE TOPRE CAPS**

Looking to downsize my artisan collection significantly and move some of these pieces to better homes.  

Up for sale this week is my Mitchcapped and MFCaps topre keys.  I've had both of these for a few months now.  The Mitchcapped are from one of his first runs.  Everything fits well and all stems are in good shape.  I think I originally picked them up for my HHKB but since I won his most recent sale, these need to find a new home.  The MFCaps are also picked up second hand and go surprisingly well with the Mitchapped mods due to the sparkles.  All stems are perfect and fit great on the HHKB.  Don't need these as the mitchcapped WASD are replacing them as well.

I'll also take reasonable offers to move these.  However I reserve the right to refuse any incredibly low-balled offers.

**BIG BALLER SPECIAL - TAKE ALL ETF ARTISANS FOR $1,100.  That's a $175 discount.**

**Wants** 

Paypal first and foremost, however I'm open to any keyboard/keycap trades.  Specifically focused on 40's but if you have something you think I might be interested in, please don't hesitate to offer it.  The worst I can say is ""No thank you.""  EPBT Royal Alpha or GMK TA Royal Alpha are high up on my list currently.  Adelie keyboard is high on the list but I understand if you don't want to trade for all my artisans.

**Shipping and Fees**

All artisans except the Subtleberry Set will be shipped in a padded envelope via USPS and all prices include shipping and PP Fees for CONUS Buyers.  I will not ship out of the country at this time as I had an issue with another artisan that arrived at a buyers house after 3 full months of waiting and caused a refund issue.

Thanks for looking and have a great afternoon!

Was having issues fitting thicker custom cables there so this was expanded (see timestamp gallery for closeup). No other modifications/damage to note of. | $325 for Bundle 

I’d rather sell outright than trade as well but I am somewhat after the below items. Can balance either direction with Paypal.

If you want to purchase everything, I'll knock off $50. I'm located near DTLA, so I can also do local sales to this area with a $20 discount if you get two or more items, if you purchase everything locally I'll give a $70 discount.

~~Hello! Looking to offload my GMK Taro because it doesn't fit my setup theme, not enough boards and mainly looking to complete my theme more, or just get cash to buy a different set.~~

~~It's barely used, I had it mounted on my Orion V3 and used it for about two weeks, and that's about it. Only keys that have some kind of visible shine are Z, X and the left side of the spacebar. Everything else is in wonderful condition.~~

~~I'm looking to trade for a rose-ish red set like GMK Darling or anything in the pink-ish red + white looking zone. Prices on this set fluctuate so please let me know if my price of~~ **~~$380 SHIPPED OBO~~** ~~is fair!~~

~~Priority to Canadians in the GTA > Canada > CONUS. Local buyers can get it off me for $360 OBO instead of $380.~~

~~Please DM me if you'd like it shipped in bags instead of trays, I'd be more than willing to discount!~~

~~EDIT: used sets of GMK Darling or other rose-red/pink-ish red sets are completely fine with me!~~

**Note:** For both of these boards, they are in good condition but have some scratches on the bottom due to use, you won't notice it when using it normally though, and it does not affect underglow at all.

Dark base and RAMA enter are opened and very lightly used (mounted on the Keycult 2/65 in timestamps), others are BNIB. Would heavily prefer to keep this as a bundle.

Gorgeous board, great thock for the cheap price. Just looking to sell to make room for other keyboards, hoping to find someone who enjoys it as much as I did.

Aluminum black version with v1 black PCB. Cherry clip-in stabilizers are clipped and lubed with Krtox 205g0 and dielectric grease - little to no rattle. Modded a Tada68 foam from MK Ultra and have it fitted in between the PCB and plate. Comes with lubed NK Cream switches - 205g0 and some fair quality Olivia Clones (NOT REAL GMK). No visible damage.

# HAVES

## Lo-pro Planck rev 4

These two kits are brand new in box, bought all the way in 2017 (or so), that I completely forgot about. These are no longer in production, though the firmware works perfectly and can be shared with rev 5. Pretty much unboxed for the first time today, and never been used before. Do take note that these are the old-fashioned ones with mini-USB port and require soldering. One of them has the black case, the other one has silver.

Asking for $110 shipped each. These packages don't have any switch or keycap, but if you need some, please mention it in the message. I have a quite a large stock that I don't want to pull out just for the timestamp.

I also have lo-pro cases in other colors (red, purple, pink green) if you would like to swap out.

## Hi-pro Preonic rev 2

Bought as a brand new kit here in r/mechmarket in 2017 or so, in attempt to play StarCraft. I ended up using this only a handful of times and have recently found out how to play StarCraft on a Planck, so this will no longer serve me at all. Unfortunately has a tiny knick on the left side of case caused by a freak accident (collision with one of my Plancks :( ), but functionally, it's perfect.

Orange case. Currently equipped with IKEA/linjar switch (a relatively light linear). Zealios Stabiliser was modded and lubed by me. Also comes with XDA Canvas keycaps.

~~Asking for $130 shipped.~~ Sold to a local acquaintant.

## KAT Alpha (40% kit)

Bought from KBDFans earlier this year. 40% variant that covers pretty much any 40% (or Preonic) under the sun. Also has the numeric row. Was mounted for 5 mins, then put back in bags. Not my kind of thing. Apparently, still in almost brand new condition.

Asking for $70 shipped in bags, $80 shipped in original tray.

## MelGeek MDA Big Bang 2.0 (with Kana)

Pretty much has the same description as above as I bought them around the same time for the same purpose. This one however is ortholinear only. Came in bags originally, so no tray to speak of. This is also the variant with Kana.

~~Asking for $80 shipped.~~ Sold for asking price to u/Shinobaee.

## Sealed GMK 9009 R3 Base kit

Not much to say about this. Another forgotten item in the closet. Still sealed. Base kit only (AFAIK, doesn't come with the numpad).

~~Asking for $270 shipped.~~ Sold locally to u/hankypandy_ at 305 SGD shipped.

|[Mode Eighty First Edition - Dark WKL](https://imgur.com/a/bu4rtwP)|The original top piece is switched out to a Deco WKL as the original First Edition only came with a standard WK one. The shiny PVD bottom is gorgeous af and it's one of my favorite sounding boards and I'm only selling to recover some funds after recently acquiring a 7V. The top case is flawless but the bottom has two light scratches. Comes with a hotswap PCB and FR4 plate as well as the carrying case and all foams. Price lowered from my last post.

Hello!

Selling GMK Mizu base kit with original tray. I have personally not used it but the 65% + white accent layout keys was lent to a cable maker for GMK Mizu themed cable photoshoot. When I received it back it looked slightly dirty so I cleaned it with 2x dental tabs, rinsed, pat dry and let it air dry overnight. You can check the condition in the photos linked.

Looking for ~~$405~~ Sold at \~$386 locally. Pm me your location to calculate shipping. Local buyers will have a slightly lower price, also pm me. **Not fcfs**, previous/local buyers will be prioritized. I can also ship them in bags if you wish, to make shipping cheaper.

Also, letting this [Vulpix](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/454660431827566623/653798202511851523/vulpix_cable_hug.jpg) Cable Hug I got from Pokémon Center Japan - $10 ($8 if getting with Mizu).As usual, comment before PM-ing. Refrain from using chats please.

Have a great week ahead!

Purely cosmetic, but there are scuffs on the case from removing keycaps-- even with the damn masking tape trick on my wire keycap puller-- as well as two light scratches on the bottom front of the case. I did my best to capture all of them.

To make it easier for buyers:

\- Shipping prices in eu generally are 4-15 euros (depends on various reasons (if it untracked or tracked), how big is the package)

\- Shipping prices to usa/canada generally are 20-70 (depends on various reasons, mostly size and weight affects price exponentially)

\- PRICE<60 € is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € for tracked;

\- 60=<PRICE<100 € (or just generally heavy) is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € - 3.5 € for tracked (unless listed otherwise)

\- PRICE=>100+ € items is sent via tracked/registered mail (unless asked otherwise);

\- Shipping to UK due to new regulations increase by roughly 3-5e (just add 3-5e to current EU price), but priority is EU > UK > Other.

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered/linked to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-60 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct.
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay, but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, ask :)*"

Hey,

It includes everything that the kit originally came with such as the aluminum plate, brass weight, and gmk cherry stabs. Trying to sell it without the keycaps & switches but if you absolutely want it as a bundle, we can work something out. I currently have NK creams lubed with 205g0 with some random Japanese PBT keycaps I found on banggood.

Asking $300 + shipping.

The shiny PVD bottom is gorgeous af and it's one of my favorite sounding boards and I'm only selling to recover some funds after recently acquiring a 7V. The top case is flawless but the bottom has two light scratches. Comes with a hotswap PCB and FR4 plate as well as the carrying case and all foams. Price lowered from my last post.|$799|

The PCB is 7305 mill-max hotswapped to support both 6.25u and 7u bottom rows as well as stepped caps lock. I was looking forever to trade for this board so I can pair it with GMK Hammerhead, but the shipping date is so far away so I can't justify keeping this despite being a great board.

|[~~Alpine65 Red w/ Extras~~](https://imgur.com/a/XEBRedV)|~~Hotswap kit with FR4 and POM plates. Flawless condition. It's an amazing board with a clean, clacky sound and hefty weight. The red looks very vibrant for ano compared to my previous red boards and it was the most limited color option as well in terms of units. Soft gaskets were installed on the bottom and hard gaskets on top case, includes extra gaskets, both foams, and the original carrying case. I'm also open to trading for a Kei in any color.~~ [~~Sound test~~](https://vocaroo.com/1btbcdvgcOiJ) ~~with Dogikons on POM. Price lowered from my last post.~~|~~$515~~ Sold for $500|

It's in overall perfect condition except for a tiny mark on the right blocker (can't even notice it myself esp. with keycaps on, just worth mentioning).

I am selling a lightly used Drop Alt low-profile in space gray that I bought from another Redditor a few months back. It includes MKUltra foam, stock keycaps, but no switches and will ship with original box and accessories (cable, keycap puller, switch puller, feet). I will also include an additional set of GMK plate stabilizers that I never got around to installing.

- *Note* that the stem on the `Tab` keycap is broken such that the keycap mounts but can come off. I am discounting the sale with that in mind.

Price is CONUS shipped. Please comment before PM and happy to answer questions.

|~~Black PC Maja~~|~~Bought from KBDfans a few months ago when they dropped. Has Durock v2 stabs. Had StupidFish (check him out btw) prototype foam on it. Been used solidly for a solid 3 weeks but I won't need it anymore. No imperfections from what I've inspected and I will ship with the weight not in the board but separately wrapped. I had the POM plate made from P3D so the cost is a bit higher~~|~~$485 shipped~~  **SOLD**|
|GMK Metaverse|Bought from another user on here. Used for 1 week and then threw it back in the box and haven't used it since. Looking to get what I bought for it|$293 shipped|
|~~69 x lubed black Holy Bobas~~|~~Made from black Gazzew housings, polia stems, and 67g spring. Lubed with Trybosis 3203 and spring Krytox GPL 105. I'm not sure if it was with my batch of black boba housings but some switches have a tolerance issue where the stem slightly struggles to return. I filmed some of them and happened to help but not a lot of these switches have these issues.~~|~~$50 shipped~~ **SOLD**|
|89 x lubed Neapolitans|Bought from CannonKeys. I liked the Salmons better and they're lw kinda the same. These don't have flakes though.|$75 shipped|
|109 x 62g Porcelain Blues|Bought from RingerKeys. Was going to use these for making creampacas but just ended up getting zakus. Completely stock. Just really want to get these away from me.|$50 shipped|
|67 x ""Solias""|Made from Polia housings and U4 silent stems. Also trying to get these away from me.|$30 shipped|

If you purchase today, then I'll be able to send this out tomorrow.

Howdy Mechmarket, decided to sell a bit of my collection in an effort to regain some funds towards a purchase. The prices aren't necessarily firm however I don't want to dip too low below asking price. 

Shipping only to CONUS, can also do local pickup in the OC/LA area (92805)

not FCFS, priority goes to Local>Bundle>Asking Price. 

Comment first and then PM, I will not answer your PM unless I see a comment first.


Item | Description | Price | Availability
---|---|----|----
GMK First Love + Spacebars | ~~Purchased the kit from another user on MM used. I myself have only mounted them once and once I did, I came to the conclusion that I much prefer GMK Moon Dust. Some of the keys do have shine to them, the ones that I have found to have more shine are as follow: 2,3,4,q,e,r,t,i,o. I did purchase the set for $410, which I know is quite high, seeing as such I'm asking for less in an effort to hopefully find a buyer~~ | ~~**$350 in bags, $375 in box**~~ | **SOLD FOR ASKING**
Lividity - Moses - No-Face & Puppeteer - Cosmodrop | comes with the information tag. Purchased these from their respective raffles, mainly want to get my money back | **$90 each, shipped. 155 if bundled** | Available
SpaceCables Islander Cable | Purchased this myself from spacecables extras sale. As much as I love this cable, it doesn't fit with my current theme, so I've decided to sell it. Works perfect. It is 6 feet long | **80 Shipped** | Available
7V PC Plate | ~~Purchased this with intent to use it on my second 7V pcb I had, however I managed to purchase an FR4 plate and use that instead. **This doesn't come with the foam.**~~ | ~~**45 Shipped**~~ | **SOLD FOR ASKING**
7V **Built** PCB + Daughterboard | ~~This PCB was built with an Alu plate, L&F 62g V2 Alpacas (courtesy of u/thebidof ), v2 Durock Stabilizers (lubed with Krytox 205g0 and dielectric grease on the wires), and soldered by myself. The pcb works 100% fine and there is no issue with it. [Sound Test here](https://youtu.be/WBxU_2FSgYQ) Selling only because I built another PCB and have no use for this one.~~ | ~~**$165 shipped**~~ | **SOLD FOR ASKING**
Novelkey Creams 131x (**47x L&F, 86 Stock**) | ~~To be honest, I bought a lot more of these than I needed. Intended to use them for other builds but I got hooked on Alpacas. The ones that are lubed have Krytox 205g0 on the housing, stem and springs. Need them gone since I have absolutely no use for them~~ | ~~**$65 shipped**~~  | **SOLD FOR ASKING**

Hey [r/mm](https://www.reddit.com/r/mm/)!

I'm running another round of my GMK Botanical themed cable. Thank you to those that participated in the previous rounds!

I've started focusing on smaller rounds as long as there is demand for quicker turnaround. I have all supplies in hand, so a 4 week turnaround should be reliable.

The cable specs are:

$75 USD (price includes shipping within US; will ship international if buyer covers any shipping cost above $5)

4 week turnaround

6.5"" coil; 4' straight end

Arisu has GMK Red Samurai keycaps and NK cream switches. TRADED WITH U/DANTE_Y_GERALD FOR GMK TOXIC

I would prefer to trade as whole with keycaps and everything but I would be open to any trades honestly. Just like trying new keyboards. I would trade all the things for a built Space65 or another nice board like that. GMMK Pro I would prefer as well"

To make it easier for buyers:

\- Shipping prices in eu generally are 4-15 euros (depends on various reasons (if it untracked or tracked), how big is the package)

\- Shipping prices to usa/canada generally are 20-70 (depends on various reasons, mostly size and weight affects price exponentially)

\- PRICE<60 € is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € for tracked;

\- 60=<PRICE<100 € (or just generally heavy) is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € - 3.5 € for tracked (unless listed otherwise)

\- PRICE=>100+ € items is sent via tracked/registered mail (unless asked otherwise);

\- Shipping to UK due to new regulations increase by roughly 3-5e (just add 3-5e to current EU price), but priority is EU > UK > Other.

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered/linked to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-60 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct. You can write to me with a similar price I offer, however if this is not my offering price, there is much lower chance I will sell item right away or at all. Especially if price is fixed
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay, but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, write something like* **""I have a question, pm""** *and ask it* **PM** *not here :) .* **All other comments** *which are not refering to PM on post are* **IGNORED** *(unless commenter is mod) and if they happens to be threadcapping (something like: ""lower the price"" ""because I want to sell my own set and threadcap your post so your would be ignored"") or toxic - reported*"

|Item|Description|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|
|[Mode Eighty First Edition - Dark WKL](https://imgur.com/a/bu4rtwP)|The original top piece is switched out to a Deco WKL as the original First Edition only came with a standard WK one. The shiny PVD bottom is gorgeous af and it's one of my favorite sounding boards and I'm only selling to recover some funds after recently acquiring a 7V. The top case is flawless but the bottom has two light scratches. Comes with a hotswap PCB and FR4 plate as well as the carrying case and all foams.|$835 OBO|
|[Rama M60-A Olivia Edition - Hotswap w/ Internal Dampener](https://imgur.com/a/SZP7HF6)|Beautiful board with a heavy PVD rose gold brass weight, in overall great condition. The back weight has some signs of use, but nothing too bad. Also includes the extra internal silicone dampener. Comes with the original Rama box and all accessories. I'm also open to trading for a Rukia, Tengu, Kei, or similar-valued Alice or 60/65% boards. Can sell for less if you don't want the dampener. Price lowered from my last post.|$650 or $599 without Dampener/ Trades for Rukia, Tengu, Kei, or other similar-valued Alices or 60/65% boards|
|[Think6.5 v2 Deep Ocean 2u w/ Hotswap PCB & Extra Teal Badge](https://imgur.com/a/JE6vJDF)|The board is in mint condition, gaskets were installed on the case. The PCB is 7305 mill-max hotswapped to support both 6.25u and 7u bottom rows as well as stepped caps lock. I was looking forever to trade for this board so I can pair it with GMK Hammerhead, but the shipping date is so far away so I can't justify keeping this despite being a great board. Comes with an extra teal nautical badge as well as the original black lightbulb badge, and all original accessories. Price lowered from my last post.|$730 OBO|
|[Alpine65 Red w/ Extras](https://imgur.com/a/XEBRedV)|Hotswap kit with FR4 and POM plates. Flawless condition. It's an amazing board with a clean, clacky sound and hefty weight. The red looks very vibrant for ano compared to my previous red boards and it was the most limited color option as well in terms of units. Soft gaskets were installed on the bottom and hard gaskets on top case, includes extra gaskets, both foams, and the original carrying case. I'm also open to trading for a Kei in any color. [Sound test](https://vocaroo.com/1btbcdvgcOiJ) with Dogikons on POM. Price lowered from my last post.|$525 OBO/Trade for Kei|
|[GMK Honey Base + Novelties](https://imgur.com/VTtltya)|Brand new sealed. Willing to trade for other GMK sets.|$350/Trades for GMK Taro, Burgundy, First Love, 8008, or other GMK sets|
|[GMK Hero Base](https://imgur.com/yriLPdv)|Brand new sealed. Willing to trade for other GMK sets.|$290/Same trades as above|
|[80x Lubed & Filmed Konpeitous w/ JX Stems](https://imgur.com/vhuVFc2)|Housing and stems were lubed with 205g0, springs with GPL 105, and filmed with white Deskeys. These are using the alternate JX stems, which are more smoother and have less wobble. The switches were never used or soldered.|$99|
|[68x Lubed & Filmed Invyr Uhmwpe Stem'd Milky Yellows](https://imgur.com/vhuVFc2)|Made with Gateron Milky Yellow housings and springs, and Invyr Uhmwpe Stems (Rev 1, not the scuffed ones). The switches have a very nice thocky profile with hints of clack and are really smooth to boot. Housing and stems were lubed with 205g0, springs with GPL 105, and filmed with KBDFans clear PC films.|$65|
|[62x Lubed & Filmed Durock L7 Linears](https://imgur.com/XxA6QC0)|Housing and stems were lubed with 205g0, springs with GPL 106, and filmed with 0.15mm black TX films. Springs are 62g, same as Alpacas.|$55|
|[Navy USB-C Coiled Cable w/ Blue Cerakote YC8](https://imgur.com/a/j6xllcm)|Jumbo 8"" coils with blue paracord and Black Magic Techflex. The YC8 connector is cerakoted in blue. The cable is like new as it was recently commissioned, just found myself preferring more neutral colors.|$65 OBO|
|[GMK Masterpiece Gold PVD Knife Rama](https://imgur.com/a/eV5dbxj)|I'm mainly looking to trade for other Brass/SS Ramas like the Pono Rose Gold. The previous owner mentioned it was mounted for 5 minutes, but I haven't used it myself and it still looks brand new.|Trades for other Brass or SS Ramas/$150 OBO|

Hi there,

I'm looking to trade the following boards:

**TGR 910 RE black.** The condition is of the aluminium is great and there's no flaws, the weight however does have a lot of tarnish on it which doesn't bother me but I know it does for some people (but I guess it happens with older boards that actually get used a lot).

* The board is currently built with a Hannah 910 Rev. 1 PCB on an aluminium plate with H1 switches (Milky Gateron tops + 55g Slow SPRiT springs) lubed with Tribosys 3204 (Krytox 106 for springs).
* The other build I have is built with the TGR-Unicorn PCB v1.2 on the original brass plate with Tealios v2 Cherry MX Top switches, filmed and lubed with Tribosys 3204.
* Will include an acrylic badge as well as the original brass badge.

**Singa x Unikorn r1 black.**

* Currently built on a polycarbonate plate with lubed gateron ink switches.
* Have an extra copper, brass and carbon fibre plate.

**Constellation black.**

* Currently built on a brass plate with lubed alpaca switches.
* Have an extra pcb, brass plate and some feet as well as screws.

  
I know this will be hard to find/achieve, but I am currently looking to trade for a **TGR Jane (v2) or TGR Alice or En Dash TKL by finder.works**. *Also open for other uncommon boards such as zekk.works boards, dalco, hyphen, etc...* **I can add PayPal or other things on my side to even out the trade.**

  
I am also looking to buy some keycap sets such as GMK originative Cyrillic/Japanese, GMK WoB hangul, GMK beige, Korean beige, ...

  
Comment before PM.

Have a nice day and take care!

- ~~FR4 Plate built with Tecsee Tactiles lubed with Carbon GS2, filmed, and spring is 67g on a FR4 Plate. Using C3 Stabs lubed with 205g0, and then dielectric painted on the wire.

~~**UTD 360C - $315 shipped**~~ SOLD for $300 shipped

- ~~Built with Dogikons lubed with 205g0, and stock spring lubed with GPL 105 on a PC plate. Using GMK Screws ins lubed with 205g0 on the housing, and wire. This also includes the stock aluminum plate, and MechLovin PCB. Taking a big hit on this one as, unfortunately, it met my granite countertop a little while back and the outcome was not in it's favor. So now there is a dent on the bottom right corner. Please look in the timestamp for more pictures. As well it's currently gummy oring mounted.~~


**Pizza65 Pearl Ruby Red - $350 Shipped**

- Built with Gateron Red Inks lubed with 205g0, spring swapped to 62g TX 16mm, and TX filmed on a POM Plate. C3 stabs lubed with 205g0 on the housing, and then painted on dielectric for the wire. This also comes with the stock brass plate.

- ~~Turquoise Tealios that have been cherry topped, lubed with 205g0, spring swapped to 63.5G SPRiT Slow, and tx filmed. These have been desoldered, but with a FR301 so the legs are cleanly desoldered. Can be used in a hotswap as have been doing that myself with these.~~

|Black PC Maja|Bought from KBDfans a few months ago when they dropped. Had StupidFish (check him out btw) prototype foam on it. Been used solidly for a solid 3 weeks but I won't need it anymore. No imperfections from what I've inspected and I will ship with the weight not in the board but separately wrapped. I had the POM plate made from P3D so the cost is a bit higher|$485 shipped|
|GMK Metaverse|Bought from another user on here. Used for 1 week and then threw it back in the box and haven't used it since. Looking to get what I bought for it|$293 shipped|
|89 x lubed Neapolitans|Bought from CannonKeys. I liked the Salmons better and they're lw kinda the same. These don't have flakes though.|$75 shipped|
|109 x 62g Porcelain Blues|Bought from RingerKeys. Was going to use these for making creampacas but just ended up getting zakus. Completely stock. Just really want to get these away from me.|$50 shipped|
|67 x ""Solias""|Made from Polia housings and U4 silent stems. Also trying to get these away from me.|$37 shipped |

If you purchase today, then I'll be able to send this out tomorrow.

The 7V is a really nice board, but I was able to obtain my preferred endgame, a Jelly Epoch in SE color. Looking to sell this one to help offset the cost of buying that board aftermarket.

It comes with 7305 mill maxed PCB, so it's hotswap ready. Also has a PC plate and a white FR4 plate, and an extra black PVD badge. Hoping to sell it all as a bundle, but will entertain parting stuff out if the offers are right.

Overall in flawless condition aside from some micro scratches on the bottom weight which are only visible at certain angles in harsh, direct light and a few finger prints on the PCB.

Please leave a comment and send PM.

$300 + shipping total including board, matching coiled cable, and I’m throwing in a free GMK Honey set lemon & honey desk mat. More than $200 less than what I paid for for the board and cable, without the need to wait on all the parts, and the mat is a free add on. It is only very lightly used and it was built in February. It feels buttery smooth and sounds just as great as it looks.

Does not include the keycaps pictured, just had them on to try the profile.

This was built by AndyVNguyen on his twitch stream. It’s the Design02 stacked curved acrylic keyboard from Arctangentkb in matte daffodil with sandblasted brass (slight patina on it), kbd67 rev2, and stupidfish plate foam. These options price at $310

Lubed and filmed Dogikon switches (63.5g JWK linears, similar to yellow recolored alpacas) Lubed with 205g0, springs lubed with 105, filmed with tx films $70

Durock V2 clear stabs $26

VoxelMods 10.5 inch coil cable with yellow MDPC-X and techflex, with a gold aviator connection, and the included wooden rod to put inside the coils to hold its shape. $98

I’ll also throw in the GMK Honey lemon and honey desk mat for free for this set. Won’t sell it alone, I got a tiny bit of thermal paste on it accidentally so I’d rather just toss it in with the rest of the honey themed matching set for free.

So total I’m just looking for $300 + shipping. I’d prefer to remain within continental US for now. I’m in Melrose Park, Illinois if you’re local and wanted to see/try it in person before you buy"

Hey guys, I am freeing up some space for the new projects

All prices include PayPal fees, invoice only. As usual please comment before DM, no chat.

**Worldwide shipping,** will be calculated on request, please DM for that. For artisans around $10, for keyboard it should be $40-50, If a keyboard buyer is in the USA I suggest using a more reliable and quicker service, should be around $80

Please note that mail services are still somewhat unpredictable, so shipping might take a long time. Apologies in advance.

&#x200B;

**1.** **Fully built Percent Studio Canoe Gen1 polycarbonate**

[Detailed pics and condition](https://imgur.com/a/4xKx5Qk)

* Built with an aftermarket PCB and an FR4 plate from [Mechlovin](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/gxtgio/gb_mechlovin_kanu_canoe_v1_compatible_pcb_plates/). Fully tuned H1s (Deskeys films, lubed with 203g2, TX 60g springs lubed with TX oil) and C3 stabs. Used Kester solder.
* PCB has support for VIA and many layouts (split backspace, split spacebar etc, see [their post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/gxtgio/gb_mechlovin_kanu_canoe_v1_compatible_pcb_plates/))
* I did enamel infills for the front and back engravings. Front is yellow (matches GMK Serika perfectly), back is dark gray with a subtle golden pearl (see pictures)

Condition:

* I accidentally touched a spot on the back weight (near 0) with a solvent, it's shinier than other surfaces. Noticeable under certain angles, see pictures
* Polycarbonate texture is a little different around infills after wiping, noticeable under certain angles, see pictures.
* Otherwise the case is pretty much perfect, might be light signs of use, but no nicks or scuffs.
* Mechloving PCB: built once, never desoldered.

&#x200B;

Only sold as a bundle

I can desolder the switches for you (Hakko FR-301) but they will still be a part of the bundle.

Feel free to reach out for more details and/or pictures and with offers.

Hello! I've been moving a lot recently so I'm trying to downsize. I have two boards that I have loved but no longer need:

~~**Anne Pro 2 w/ Gateron Brown switches (black) - $50 shipped OBO**~~ SOLD for $45 (local)

~~Used, shows signs of use but nothing major. Fully functional in wired and wireless modes including all RGB lights. Also contains all accessories, including the keycap puller and stock cable, and all bonus colored mods, except for the blank red Esc keycap. I lost that one.~~

**Massdrop Alt - no switches - $150 shipped OBO**

The board will come with upgraded stabs, I threw out the stock ones and replaced them with authentic pre-retool GMK stabs, lubed and clipped.I'm not selling the switches because I repurposed some of the stock switches in other projects after I swapped in new switches. I want the old switches though so you can have the board with no switches. I will sell the stock keycaps though as I have no need for them. They are undamaged but the spacebar came slightly warped, though that is normal for PBT spacebars. It doesn't affect typing. Anyway, the board is undamaged except for one scratch on the underside by one of the screws (see the photo album).

I have the items listed below, I am trying to get rid of most of my keyboard stuff because of my financial situation. If you need different angles or have a specific request please let me know in PM. :)

Prices are based on my educated guess, so I might be a bit off. If so, let me know your offer and maybe, just maybe we can work something out :)

**Think 6.5 V2 Valentine**

I have built this board with Alpaca switches (lubed) and Durock Screw in stabs (lubed). I have used the board for about one to two days, so it's brand new. Thinking of 550 euro's.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**~~KBD75~~**  **SOLD**

~~This was one of my first boards so it was used, however I have desoldered the original switches I had on it and replaced it with this. With these switches I maybe have used it for 2 months in the office before it went back to the closet. It has screw in GMK stabs (lubed) , Glorious panda switches (lubed) and jade box switches on the f-row (unlubed) . Thinking of 125 euro's.Edit: Forgot to mention there is a small piece of the see through plastic in the side broken. I made an additional photo of this error (next to usb-c port)~~

&#x200B;

**Matrix keycaps**

Simple OEM keycaps, PBT backlight goes through legends. Thinking of 30 euro's.

&#x200B;

**Melgeek Dusk keycaps**ABS Melgeek keycaps (dusk version). these are kind of like SA but different .  Thinking of 125 euro's."

To make it easier for buyers:

\- Shipping prices in eu generally are 4-15 euros (depends on various reasons (if it untracked or tracked), how big is the package)

\- Shipping prices to usa/canada generally are 20-70 (depends on various reasons, mostly size and weight affects price exponentially)

\- PRICE<60 € is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € for tracked;

\- 60=<PRICE<100 € (or just generally heavy) is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € - 3.5 € for tracked (unless listed otherwise)

\- PRICE=>100+ € items is sent via tracked/registered mail (unless asked otherwise);

\- Shipping to UK due to new regulations increase by roughly 3-5e (just add 3-5e to current EU price), but priority is EU > UK > Other.

In the future I may offer lube or soldering services. I have enough trades to provide services, now just waiting when two last trades completes.

The listed items is easily reachable and I can photoshoot them every two weeks. However I have more items (switches, pcbs, keyboard cases), which is too much work to photoshoot (it is really annoying to do that every two weeks), but you can ask me more options and I may list more items.

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered/linked to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-60 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct. You can write to me with a similar price I offer, however if this is not my offering price, there is much lower chance I will sell item right away or at all. Especially if price is fixed
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay, but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, ask :)*"
