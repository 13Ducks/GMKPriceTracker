The board has been desoldered and comes with lubed c3 stabs already installed on the PCB.  Just need to solder in switches and you're good to go!  Comes with plate foam, alu plate, desoldered PCB with stabs installed (which is also compatible with VIA - LED has been set to blue ATM), and original packaging.  I purchased this board for $650 brand new.~~|~~trades or $450 shipped CONUS (OBO)~~ **SOLD**|

Hello folks,

I did some research and am trying to do a good price on this, 25 -50 under what I’m finding. If you are in the USA shipping is included. If you are international that does NOT scare me off but I will quote you the price for shipping and I will chip in 10$ (cuz that’s the USA price roughly)

Another point to add, this is an offense-free zone so if my pricing is off, PLEASE let me know. I’m not trying to gauge I’m just out of the game for 1.5 years and these sets are sealed and collecting dust.

Stay safe everyone!!

This is from R1 from many moons ago. I built this when I first got it from the GB, and have not kept up with the keyboard community anymore.

I know it has a carbon fiber plate, gmk stabs clipped and lubed, as for the switches.. I have zero clue what they are. I know they’ve been lubed with 3204 (are those the correct numbers? lol). Sky switches? Is that a thing? I really don’t remember. They’re tactile, and are not heavy. 

Edit: split backspace, all the rgb LEDs work. 

Edit2: switches say OUTEMU on them. 

I’m asking $450 shipped OBO. Conus only. PM before comment. I don’t have any confirmed trades here but have 30+ over on r/hardwareswap.

There is nothing wrong with the board except for a small mark near a screw hole (check pics).  Compared to the time80, this board is much heavier and also comes with a ""3rd ann."" tag that is removable.  The board has been desoldered and comes with lubed c3 stabs already installed on the PCB.  Just need to solder in switches and you're good to go!  Comes with plate foam, alu plate, desoldered PCB with stabs installed (which is also compatible with VIA - LED has been set to blue ATM), and original packaging.

Tragically, this board suffered damage on the left-hand-side bezel chamfer =(  Think of the damage as a way to get a 2.0add on the cheap and then recoat it to whatever color you'd like =P (hahaha) Because of the damage, I am heavily considering offers on the board! |$750 shipped conus OBO|

Hereby I'm selling my last board that I build recently its about 5 weeks old and in basically new state. I build it for a lightweight board to take to work but I just find myself not using it at all. I would highly prefer selling it as a full build so that will have priority its not FCFS. For the build its build with C3 Equalz stabs which have been lubed by myself with krytox G205, Its build with stock Gazzew Bobagum silent Linear's (52g) Comes with 10 extra switches. It also has some Korea keycaps from kbdfans on it. The board comes with all the original boxes/accesories. Im selling the full build including fees but not including shipping for 350,00 (I again highly prefer selling as a whole build)

The deskmat is in good shape used for about a month cleaned weekly (with a cleaning towel) comes in original packaging I'm selling it for 35,00 excluding shipping but including fees.

Price include Paypal fees but do not include shipping.

[**KBDfans D60** - **$220 shipped, was $319 before shipping from KBDfans**](https://imgur.com/a/lTSY1Cl)

Comes with:

 * Case (green top, grey bottom, gaskets and bump-ons installed on case)
 * Rear brass weight
 * FR4 Plate (switch cutouts are too tight for comfort, you can shove a switch with force  but I'd probably sand the cutouts first)
 * Polycarbonate Plate
 * DZ60RGB-ANSI v2 Hotswap PCB
 * DZ60RGB-ANSI v2 Plate Foam
 * DZ60RGB-ANSI v2 Case Foam
 * Cherry Screw-in Stabilizers (4x 1u and 1x 6.25u)

___

Keyboard will come assembled with the polycarbonate plate. If you do disassemble the keyboard, please take note of the 2 different screw lengths. The longer ones go on on the side with the USB cutout.

KBDfans did not provide me enough gaskets so they were not applied to the sides of of the top and bottom parts of the case.

Other than what's listed below, the exterior of the case has no flaws such as dents, dings or scratches. The brass weight looks flawless on the part that will seen. I haven't unscrewed it to check the backside.

 * There are 3 very small dings on the USB cutout bezel.

 * There is a scratch on the interior of the bottom half of the case where the inset screw (too long) of the USB bezel touched the case. This came like this from KBDfans, I've attached a small piece of tape to hopefully prevent more damage to the case there.

 * There are 2 dings/marks on the interior of the top part of the case from hooks used during the anodization process. This is common with most anodized boards, even the high-end ones.

[**IFK Amalfi \(base kit + extension kit\)** - **$160 shipped in trays, take $20 off if bundled with keyboard**](https://imgur.com/a/kjbUcZT)
 
 * Lightly used, no shine. Will be shipped in the original trays and box but the base kit box has seen better days (some dented corners, ripped at one of the sides, scratches, etc.)

[**KAT Kitty \(TKL kit\)** - **$180 shipped in trays, take $30 off if bundled with keyboard**](https://imgur.com/a/0ntnDlS)

 * Not the first owner but I briefly used it with the D60 listed. There are some superficial marks/scratches on some of the sides, edges and face of the keys. I'm not sure if it's because the keys are a darker color so wear is more visible since they are only just plastic or it's the wear/defect that some people were saying were present in this KAT set. Regardless, I don't notice it unless I'm actively looking for the keys that have them up close and at certains angles so the light can reflect. The 7u spacebar is also borked. Doesn't work, maybe the stem is slightly too close/misaligned. Will be shipped in the original trays and boxes but they have seen better days (scratches, dented, etc.)

Hello r/mechmarket, I am trying to sell some stuff that I have that no longer gets used.

\_33 w/ P3D case in black and smoke acrylic on underside - 100 shipped - Built up with T1 switches, lubed and filmed, feel very solid and I like the board but it hasn't been flashed since I just used it for a fun build experience and display board

100 lubed kiwi switches - 65 shipped - Bought these off of mechmarket at the beginning of the year...dear god it has been a while...I like the sound and feel but I have gradually moved away from heavy tactile switches so I am letting these go, only used in hot swap boards never soldered in.

I am currently unable to go to the post office till the 1st of September so please be patient if you do want something, I will ship as soon as I can!

Looking for - gmk modo lite with the aesthetic kit, gmk hero w/ novelties kit, or whatever set you may have that you are trying to offload."

Unfortunately I’m going to be letting this go after having owning it for about a month. I’ve been putting it together with parts here and there over the year from this forum.

Timestamp: https://imgur.com/a/sq7S9eZ

* KBDFANS TOFU65 Aluminum 65% Case in black 
* DZ65 RGB v2 Hotswap PCB 
* Brass plate
* Zeal transparent stabs (lubed with Krytox 205g0 and dieletric grease. Band aid modded)
* Tangerines 67g hand picked to be lubed and filmed
* Gateron Reds (unlubed)
* Laser R1 Base Kit + Novelties/ extras

Currently the switch layout is prioritizing fps games, so everything except the following will be the tangerines (all extras will be bagged):

w,a,s,d,q,r,f,z,1,2,4,shift,ctrl,alt, and space

There is a scratch on the right side of the case as pictured in the album and the brass weight does have scratches as well. Other than that the case is in good shape. 

Price: $450 CONUS only/ or pick-ups can be made. Open to offers, but honestly this would help pay for my girl’s medical bills :/

Currently located in Los Angeles for the month, and if it doesn’t sell this month I’m bringing it back with me to Japan."

I've hit a rough patch and am in need of some cash., so I'm selling a few things. I'm not necessarily looking/hoping to sell everything listed, but I wanted to put everything up to see what there would be interest in. Prices are OBO. Keyboard prices include CONUS shipping, Keycap prices include CONUS shipping in bags - shipping in trays will be an extra $10. Shipping outside of CONUS is totally doable, but we'll have to discuss things. Sales are not FCFS. I'll prefer to do bundles for what I do sell, and like I said, I'm not necessarily looking to sell everything. Keyboards do not include cables (excluding the Race3), but they are all various USB, so odds are you'd have a cable lying around which would work. Please send me offers if you see something you like, or want to work out a bundle for things. Comment first, and please PM - I'm less likely to see messages through Reddit Chat in a reasonable amount of time. Timestamps are in the individual images. Regarding the used keycaps - I'm really bad at gauging shine. I don't think there is much of any on either set, but I don't really know how to photograph it to show or not show potential shine.

Yo yo,

Ever seen a keycap set that stole your heart? You then buy it, take pictures of them and realise you are never going to be able to type on them since they only have dots on 'm, no letters? That's exactly why I'm selling them! Up for sale:

* **G****MK Dots R1**: used for pictures like these, and then put back in the box to never use them again. Have not been used. **€ 270**
* **X****D60**: Really want to get rid of this one. Nice starter board, comes with a great variety of backlight and has MX Reds. Comes with the keycaps. **€ 45**

I would like:

* A new **KBD8X pcb**, EU only because of the massive import costs etc.

Item | Price | Description
---|---|---
Return 60 | 375 | I received it from the GB few small marks on the weight, but it's so small and anodized over that it can only be seen at certain angles. Otherwise the board is in good condition. Comes with desoldered bootmapper PCB and original box.
Zer0.9 EE | 500 | Desoldered once, no blemishes. Comes with c^3 PCB and iron plate.
HHHH Salamander | 650 | Has a few issues. The previous owner had the case powder coated, and I think some screws are hard to get in as a result. Weight has a good amount of patina but can easily been cleaned. Alu plate was spray painted by previous owner and has some rough spots especially around the edges. [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/C3TsEqq). Comes with desoldered H87a.
~~UTD 360c~~ | 300 | Desoldered pcb. Back right corner is dented and one of the alignment tabs is sheared, but the case closes normally ([pics](https://imgur.com/a/K42oQlx)). I don't know how this happened and am not the original owner.
Mekanisk Klippe S | 250 | Missing a plate screw. Plate and PCB around one switch is scratches, but not visible since that switch is under the blocker. I don't know how this happened and am not the original owner. [Pic](https://i.imgur.com/SeKfxbx.jpg).
~~GMK Modern Dolch Light base~~ | 210 | Sealed.
BSP green/beige | 150 | [Layout](https://i.imgur.com/ygvy5kI.jpg). Good condition.
~~OTD DCS Soware~~ | 160 | [Layout](https://i.imgur.com/lYgGFHI.jpg). Small scratch on shift key ([pic](https://i.imgur.com/uHoTbfv.jpg)) but otherwise like new condition.
MX black retooled x85 | 75 | Desoldered. Lubed with 205g0, filmed, ~72g springs. These were not lubed my me.

Hi Mechmarket,

I am looking to sell my GMK Toxic base kit. It is opened and maybe used for an hour total. It didn't end up matching my Think 6.5 as well as I would of liked so I am looking to let it go. I am asking **$180 USD + Shipping.**

I am also looking to sell 88x stock OPBlack switches. These are from the keyspresso group buy back in February and I believe they are Round 2. They have the 65g DL springs from ThicThock. ~~I am asking **$55 USD + Shipping** for these.~~ **SOLD**

These will be shipped with USPS Priority Mail with insurance and signature confirmation, unless otherwise asked for. I am willing to make a deal if bundled together as shipping would be cheaper. Please comment before sending me a pm. Thanks!"

Hello, I have two budget builds that I wanna let go:

**~~BUILD 1: $240 + shipping CONUS only, $240 local cash~~** ***SOLD***

* ~~KBD67 Lite R1 (White) + carrying case~~
   * ~~GMK screw-in stabilizers (holee modded, housing lubed with 205g0, wires lubed with XHT-bdz)~~
   * ~~Stock TKC Kiwi switches (67 mounted, 24 loose, includes original container)~~
   * ~~Momoko Sugar Orange PBT Dye-sublimated keycap set~~
   * ***~~NOTE: Small scratch above the 1 key, see timestamps (price reduced)~~***

**BUILD 2: $210 + shipping CONUS only, $210 local cash**

* TKC Portico (Smoke) + carrying case
   * C^(3) screw-in stabilizers (holee modded, housing lubed with 205g0, wires lubed with XHT-bdz)
   * Stock Kailh Box Whites (67 mounted, 53 loose)
   * EnjoyPBT Blumen ABS Double-shot keycap set

&#x200B;

I'll include all accessories & carrying case for each keyboard, along with original packaging of the switches & keycaps. I believe the pricing to be fair, as it is lower than what I've paid for all the items combined, including labor. I am NOT looking to part out the builds at this time.

I would highly prefer local cash over shipping. My zip is 11204.

Please comment before PM'ing.

Thank you."

[**KBDfans D60** - **$220 shipped, was $319 before shipping from KBDfans**](https://imgur.com/a/lTSY1Cl)

Comes with:

 * Case (green top, grey bottom, gaskets and bump-ons installed on case)
 * Rear brass weight
 * FR4 Plate (switch cutouts are too tight for comfort, you can shove a switch with force  but I'd probably sand the cutouts first)
 * Polycarbonate Plate
 * DZ60RGB-ANSI v2 Hotswap PCB
 * DZ60RGB-ANSI v2 Plate Foam
 * DZ60RGB-ANSI v2 Case Foam
 * Cherry Screw-in Stabilizers (4x 1u and 1x 6.25u)

___

Keyboard will come assembled with the polycarbonate plate. If you do disassemble the keyboard, please take note of the 2 different screw lengths. The longer ones go on on the side with the USB cutout.

KBDfans did not provide me enough gaskets so they were not applied to the sides of of the top and bottom parts of the case.

Other than what's listed below, the exterior of the case has no flaws such as dents, dings or scratches. The brass weight looks flawless on the part that will seen. I haven't unscrewed it to check the backside.

 * There are 3 very small dings on the USB cutout bezel.

 * There is a scratch on the interior of the bottom half of the case where the inset screw (too long) of the USB bezel touched the case. This came like this from KBDfans, I've attached a small piece of tape to hopefully prevent more damage to the case there.

 * There are 2 dings/marks on the interior of the top part of the case from hooks used during the anodization process. This is common with most anodized boards, even the high-end ones.

____

[**IFK Amalfi \(base kit + extension kit\)** - **$160 shipped in trays, take $20 off if bundled with keyboard**](https://imgur.com/a/kjbUcZT)
 
 * Lightly used, no shine. Will be shipped in the original trays and box but the base kit box has seen better days (some dented corners, ripped at one of the sides, scratches, etc.)

[**KAT Kitty \(TKL kit\)** - **$180 shipped in trays, take $30 off if bundled with keyboard**](https://imgur.com/a/0ntnDlS)

 * Not the first owner but I briefly used it with the D60 listed. There are some superficial marks/scratches on some of the sides, edges and face of the keys. I'm not sure if it's because the keys are a darker color so wear is more visible since they are only just plastic or it's the wear/defect that some people were saying were present in this KAT set. Regardless, I don't notice it unless I'm actively looking for the keys that have them up close and at certains angles so the light can reflect. The 7u spacebar is also borked. Doesn't work, maybe the stem is slightly too close/misaligned. Will be shipped in the original trays and boxes but they have seen better days (scratches, dented, etc.)

This is from R1 from many moons ago. I built this when I first got it from the GB, and have not kept up with the keyboard community anymore.

I know it has a carbon fiber plate, gmk stabs clipped and lubed, as for the switches.. I have zero clue what they are. I know they’ve been lubed with 3204 (are those the correct numbers? lol). Sky switches? Is that a thing? I really don’t remember. They’re tactile, and are not heavy. 

Edit: split backspace, all the rgb LEDs work.

Switchtop 9key macropad: 

Comes with Tangerine v1s lubed with 205g0, though they might need to be relubed. I swapped out some of the hardware to give the pad a very tiny angle. Flashed with numpad keys (1-9).

~~*Looking for $25 shipped within the CONUS*~~
Sold for asking.

-----------------
GMK Laser:

I mostly used the gaijin alphas, and I'm pretty sure the cyberdeck alphas are basically untouched. I might've mounted it onto a board once to take some pictures.

These will come shipped in bags since the flimsy original GMK packaging fell apart right when I opened it. There is some slight shine on the keycaps that I rest my hands on(e.g. wasd, spacebar). Scuffed video attempting to show the shine in timestamp album.

*Looking for $180 shipped within CONUS for now. I am not willing to part them either, for now.*

Been a while since I've been on here thanks to both my Key65's which I've been more than happy with for a year but it was only a matter of time. I tried pricing things accordingly even though I bought them for way more especially the boards. However, if something seems off feel free to let me know, send me a link to another post and I'll do a similar price- not trying to rip anyone off. Selling the items on the floor, trading the items on the chair which I've been meaning to sell but figured I'd try trading for what I want first. If you have what I'm looking for and don't want to trade send me your price.

The Key65 with the teal key will come with the pink key and pink base since that's the original parts. If you'd like additional pics feel free to ask. I will fairly discount bundles if anyone is interesting in more than 1 thing, can't say how much until I know which items so just ask.

Hi mm!

Arrived last month after buying unmounted from u/Auracity and mounted once myself, then quickly realized that the white is WS2 and not WS1 like on my gmk bleached because it stood out like a sore thumb. So, here I am selling for the amount I bought it for ($70) plus shipping. 

Thanks!

|[Fox Labs F80SE](https://imgur.com/a/0eHaegP)|Built up my e-white time80, which I absolutely love (konpeitou switches/GMK ashes) so I'm selling my other e-white fox labs board.  There is nothing wrong with the board except for a small mark near a screw hole (check pics).  Compared to the time80, this board is much heavier and also comes with a ""3rd ann."" tag that is removable.  The board has been desoldered and comes with lubed c3 stabs already installed on the PCB.  Just need to solder in switches and you're good to go!  Comes with plate foam, alu plate, desoldered PCB with stabs installed (which is also compatible with VIA - LED has been set to blue ATM), and original packaging.  I purchased this board for $650 brand new.|trades or $525 shipped CONUS (OBO)|
|~~90x blue velvet (tactile) switches~~|~~88 are new and stock, 2 are lubed and filmed.~~|~~$42 shipped conus OBO~~ **sold for $40**|

 

I am also looking for these boards/things that I would like to trade my f80SE for but also add paypal if needed.

Reposting from a previous post of mine. I am still trying to trade my Polaris WKL Blue for a Polaris WK any color. This board is not for sale, trade only.

Also looking to trade my Polaris WKL in Blue for a Polaris WK in any color. Also just looking to trade the case itself, no need to trade weights or internals. My case does have the gaskets already installed. No worries if yours also does or doesn't. One flaw on the inside of the case (can view in photo album below). You can't see it with the keycap on. Looking for board in similar condition.

Hereby I'm selling my last board that I build recently its about 5 weeks old and in basically new state. I build it for a lightweight board to take to work but I just find myself not using it at all. I would highly prefer selling it as a full build so that will have priority its not FCFS. For the build its build with C3 Equalz stabs which have been lubed by myself with krytox G205, Its build with stock Gazzew Bobagum silent Linear's (52g) Comes with 10 extra switches. It also has some Korea keycaps from kbdfans on it. The board comes with all the original boxes/accesories. Im selling the full build including fees but not including shipping for 350,00 (I again highly prefer selling as a whole build)

The deskmat is in good shape used for about a month cleaned weekly (with a cleaning towel) comes in original packaging I'm selling it for 35,00 excluding shipping but including fees.

Price include Paypal fees but do not include shipping.

Prices are **ALL OBO!** They also include shipping costs and shipped through either USPS or UPS, fully insured. International is okay if you're willing to pay extra costs. Local is Westchester, N.Y. (specifically New Rochelle) and I'll offer a discount for picking things up from my place (father of a newborn = life saver if I don't have to go out to ship). No trades. Not FCFS: I will prioritise those that have more trades and feedback, and local sales.

Hey guys, looking to move some things I'm no longer using.

**Domikey Atlantis - $75 shipped in bags**

Got these from another redditor and love the color scheme, but not a fan of SA. Has very light shine from prior owner, but to my eye it's pretty much not noticeable. Paid more than $75 and just trying to recoup some of the cost.

**AKKO Carbon Caps - $55 shipped in OG packaging, $45 shipped in bags**

Love the quality and value of these, but realized I'm not an ASA fan either (of course I have to like cherry and expensive GMK kits like a basic bitch.) No shine and barely used, no caps missing.

~~**70 Diamond Linear Switches - $45 shipped**~~ sold

[More info on them here](https://bespokekeys.shop/products/tecsee-diamond-linear-switches)

Very smooth as they're mostly made of UHMWPE, but slightly too heavy for me. Unused and stock.

Firm on my prices and only shipping to CONUS. Don't be afraid to shoot me a pm if you have any questions!"

Item | Price | Description
---|---|---
Return 60 | 375 | I received it from the GB few small marks on the weight, but it's so small and anodized over that it can only be seen at certain angles. Otherwise the board is in good condition. Comes with desoldered bootmapper PCB and original box.
Zer0.9 EE | 500 | Desoldered once, no blemishes. Comes with c^3 PCB and iron plate.
HHHH Salamander | 650 | Has a few issues. The previous owner had the case powder coated, and I think some screws are hard to get in as a result. Weight has a good amount of patina but can easily been cleaned. Alu plate was spray painted by previous owner and has some rough spots especially around the edges. [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/C3TsEqq). Comes with desoldered H87a.
UTD 360c | 300 | Desoldered pcb. Back right corner is dented and one of the alignment tabs is sheared, but the case closes normally ([pics](https://imgur.com/a/K42oQlx)). I don't know how this happened and am not the original owner.
Mekanisk Klippe S | 250 | Missing a plate screw. Plate and PCB around one switch is scratches, but not visible since that switch is under the blocker. I don't know how this happened and am not the original owner. [Pic](https://i.imgur.com/SeKfxbx.jpg).
GMK Modern Dolch Light base | 230 | Sealed.
BSP green/beige | 150 | [Layout](https://i.imgur.com/ygvy5kI.jpg). Good condition.
OTD DCS Soware | 160 | [Layout](https://i.imgur.com/lYgGFHI.jpg). Small scratch on shift key ([pic](https://i.imgur.com/uHoTbfv.jpg)) but otherwise like new condition.

Hey MM!

I'm still looking to clear up some space and pass along my beloved U80-A to a new home.

Details:

* **~~Moon Rama U80-A Hotswap~~**~~. I'm sad to let this one go, but it's been sitting on my desk not getting much use and I'd love for it to go to a better home. It's in excellent condition with only one tiny visible mark on the outer case (see photos). Other than that there are some light scratches on the plate from switch pulling but nothing that's visible when assembled. The back weight has some fingerprints and light marks but nothing deep or noticeable from a distance. This is Seq 1 so the weight and plate are both in the polished Moon color and the board will come with tuned Durock stabs and the Rama internal dampener. Comes with original box but~~ **~~no~~** ~~original accessories.~~ [~~Soundtest w/ ePBT Notion, L+F banana splits, and the internal dampener~~](https://imgur.com/mS6sDQh) ~~(recorded directly on iPhone).~~

Hello, friend.

**UK/EU ONLY. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE EITHER OF OUR TIME ENQUIRING IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE OF THIS REGION. PLEASE COMMENT BELOW AFTER PMING, NO CHATS.**

**If you have any questions, please let me know and i'd be happy to help!**

I am selling a variety of L&F Switches along with my beloved Tofu65, all listed below.

Switches, all have been broken in after a month or so of usage. Lubed and filmed as listed below;

&#x200B;

|~~L&F Milky Tealios (v2) x 68~~|~~Mounted once on a hot-swap board. Tealios switches (v2) with a milky yellow gateron top housing. Spring swapped to 72g SPRiT slow springs. Lubed with Krytox 205g0 on the housing, 105g0 on the springs. Filmed with TX 0.15mm black films~~|Sold for asking|
|:-|:-|:-|
|~~L&F MX Hyperglide Black x 81~~|~~Mounted a few times across several boards. They are the latest revision of MX Black switches (hyperglides). Have been broken in for a couple of months now, all are lubed with Krytox 205g0 and filmed with TX Black 0.15mm films. Springs have been swapped to SPRiT 72g Slow springs.~~| Sold for asking|

&#x200B;

* Voice65 POM Plate - **28GBP (you pay postage)**

This literally came through today from ProtoTypist. As I have sold my Voice 65 since then, I have no use for this. The plate has all the relevant counter sunk screw holes and the leafs for the gasket mount needed for the board. Just looking to make my money back on this.

&#x200B;

* Burgundy Tofu65 with GMK Red Samurai Keycaps - **210GBP (you pay postage - please prepared for higher than normal postage costs as this board weighs a lot)**

This board is perfect for anyone getting into the scene, get your first GMK keycap set along with a very decent sounding board all in one package.

[Sound test of this exact board can be found on my video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5Inkwkt7BY)

Used this board for close to 3/4 months now. Package includes;

* Tofu65 Burgundy (has one minor mark on the front, barely visible to the point where I struggled to get a picture of it, otherwise it's in very good condition and will come fully built). Comes with a brass weight on the back.
* GMK Red Samurai Keycaps (little to no shine, I have tried to demonstrate this in the images. **You will only receive the keycaps pictured on the board!**)
* Durock Stabilisers v1 (lubed with 205g0 and dielectric grease, holee modded)
* SP Star Grey switches to cover the board (Lubed with Krytox 205g0 and filmed with TX 0.15mm)
* DZ65 v2 RGB Hotswap PCB
* DZ65 Case Foam
* Brass plate (with KBDFANs Module Foam on - this can be removed easily by yourself after purchase if wanted)
* O-Ring mounts for the screw holes
* Sorbothane to go inside the case

&#x200B;

* Various GMK Red Samurai Keycaps (shown pictured in trays on timestamp) - **Varies depending on Keycap(s) wanted**

I have left over keycaps from buying the 65% set and the ortholinear set from drop. The keycaps pictured in the box/plastic tray are all available for purchase, as many or as little as you want I will sell to you. Please send me a PM to enquire about the cost for different keycaps."

Hi MM! Just trying to sell some stuff to buy new boards

**Used Purple Portico +Gmk Laser R2 Base and Novelties-$320 Shipped OBO(-$5 if you want laser shipped in bags)**

To start off, the purple portico has everything from the original kit however I have taken out all the plate screws and some of the case screws(U can just screw them back in). Next, the stabs are the original stabs except for the spacebar which is a durock v2 and all of them are holee modded and lubed with krytox205G0. Lastly, there are some scuffs on the plate and backpiece which can be seen in the timestamp. The Gmk laser set has only been used on this portico for about 4 months and has little to no shine on the gamer keys.

Hey MM,

Today I have a few items that need new homes.

1. ~~Smoke KBD67 Lite bundle. This keyboard sounds insane and is built with spring-swapped Raed switches that are lubed and filmed. The new springs are 70g and fill out the clacky sounds of the switches. The whole board is one of my favorites despite having more expensive keebs; it sounds and feels so good. It has a polycarbonate plate and was modded to have polyfill in the case and I also tape modded the PCB.  The Polycarb case has a few superficial cracks in it, but it does not affect taking the board apart or anything. I have HK gaming 9009 keycaps on it right now.~~ **~~Looking to sell it as a bundle for 225 shipped. Sold without HK Gaming keycaps.~~**
2. HK Gaming keycaps still available. Barely used, no shine. **35 shipped.**
3. Novelkeys Bento Torii Deskmat. Light use for two days then stored. **50 shipped.**
4. 41x L+F TKC Dragonfruits. Great light tactile switch similar to Ergo clears. **35 shipped.**
5. 59x L+F Banana Splits that were spring swapped to 68g. IMO, this fixes a lot of the sound associated with these switches and they feel excellent. **70 shipped.**
6. Fraktal Kaps 4/20 Artisan - **40 shipped**
7. ~~Keyforge Shishi - Bruce Banner Colorway~~ **~~55 shipped Sold for asking.~~**
8. PBT Mizu - Great looking alternative to the GMK set. **55 shipped.**

If you have any questions, just PM me!

Thanks!"

Also interested in trading or buying Yu.keys rami's

Would like to trade for a keyboard, I like 7v, jelly epoch, and cyberboard. Can hear other board offers, been using a ducky for more than 1 year in this hobby.

All prices are shipped conus, more if international. Can do discounts for bundles of two or more caps.

**KEYBOARDS**

[**Smoky Gray PC TMOv2 with FR4 & Brass Plate, Sealed PCB, Carrying Case, Microfiber Cloth (DOES NOT INCLUDE SWITCHES/STABS)**](https://imgur.com/a/iLaTaQE)

*$450 + shipping*

**Edit: Somebody expressed interest in purchasing only the FR4 plate, willing to sell TMOv2 bundle WITHOUT the FR4 plate for $425 + shipping**

Includes FR4 Plate, Brass Plate, Sealed PCB, Carrying Case and Microfiber Cloth + some stickers. 

(I can include the original desoldered PCB, but the top left most pad does not work, the PCB has been built 3 times and will be desoldered for a 4th time before shipping. You might be able to jump the pad.)

It has served me well and has seen lots of use. There are a few surface blemishes that are detailed in the above album, but are only visible at specific angles under harsh lighting. 

I will be desoldering the current PCB, so switches and stabs are not included.

**GMK Bushido Base Kit** |  *$205 shipped* **SOLD for asking** | Base Kit was opened for inspection but never mounted. Full disclosure: NovelKeys has base kit extras up for sale, I priced mine to be slightly under after shipping/taxes. Let me know if buying from the site is less than $205 shipped w/ a screenshot and I'd be happy to beat that price by $5
**Yellow Keyreative Blanks** | *$25 shipped* | From TKC, light use, no ""new"" shine, these keycaps are normally pretty smooth and slightly shiny when new.

smoke PC TMO50v2 | smoky PC case with PCB cleanly de-soldered using an FR-301. yes, this board ran recently but smoke PC didn't make a return as a color. great board, but honestly it's just been sitting on a shelf for the past few months with little to no use. weight has a few spots of patina/tarnish/whatever you want to call it. comes with Cannonkeys carrying case. If you're compelled to make an offer, feel free to do so if it means that you'll be buying it. I need this thing gone and into a better home. | $500 shipped | yes!
Raeds x140 | lubed with GS2 and spring-swapped to TX 70g 16mm. These are pretty cool switches but I'm no longer using these in any builds. a large majority (around 100) have been previously soldered and cleanly desoldered using an SS-02. **I will not be breaking up this quantity unless I can somehow get two buyers to ask for quantities that add up to 140.** | $160 shipped | yes!
silent T1 switches x70 | I only bought these because I didn't want to buy only keyboard feet from PrimeKB. I have no use for these. **price is below what I paid retail** please keep in mind that I'll be shipping these priority mail so lowering price isn't much of an option at this point. | $45 shipped | yes!
black/purple aviator cable | received this as part of a trade, but I have no use for it as I already have a custom cable. coil is on device side, and connector is USB-mini. | $30 shipped | yes!
1800-sized wooden wrist rest | received this as part of a trade, but I have no use for it since I float my wrists while typing. It's a little bit bigger than TKL and fits 1800 the best. If you got a rekt1800 somewhat recently, this might be interesting to you. Check the timestamp album for a picture of with with my Aegis (nothing on the Aegis is considered for sale so please don't ask). The wrist-rest has some material on the underside of it to help it stay in place. If you buy this, please please please consider buying something else since I'll need to go out of my way to buy a big enough box to fit it. | $30 shipped | yes!
Pink Haze Bukkakey | by Bad n' Booj. **price is below what I paid retail** | $50 shipped | yes!
Magenta Crayons Eggface v2 | by ETF/Nightcaps. part of the 420 sale this year. **price is below what I paid retail** | $50 shipped First Class | yes
Pika Lucky Cat | by Ko Caps. sold as FCFS when originally released. **price is below what I paid retail** | $50 shipped First Class | yes!
Beggy Phuck | by Rejeck Kaps. I'm not sure why I entered for this one, I didn't even get GMK Greg. **price is below what I paid retail** | $50 shipped First Class | yes!


Priority for responding to offers will be as follows:

 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing all items for asking price (will give discount for purchasing all items listed here because holy moly that means you have money)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any bundle of the TMO50v2 + artisan for asking price (will give discount accordingly)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing the TMO50v2 for asking price
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any bundle of the GMK Black Modi + artisan for asking price (will give discount accordingly)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any bundle of artisans for asking price (will give discount accordingly)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any one item for asking price

Outside of the listed conditions, I'll check based on when you comment **and** PM. The PM is absolutely necessary for the sale of these items. Since I've had this happen before, if there are two people interested in the same item, but one is willing to pay no questions asked while the other has questions or wants to see more pics, I'm 100% selling to the person who will pay no questions asked. Requests for additional pictures will also take longer than you think, so please consider that when trying to secure an item.

Please understand that if you as a buyer and I agree on a price and you back out of the purchase right after I send the invoice, I will refuse to sell anything to you in the future (yes, that includes if you offer me something like $300 on something that I'm selling for much less). 

 **Do not use the chat function**, I honestly don't know how you are taken to the chat function when the bot's verification post gives you a link to PM sellers. I will ignore you and you won't be in consideration for anything until you send me a PM. I will also ignore you if you do not comment before sending a PM.

If I don't respond, it's likely because I'm just busy doing other things. I will get to all messages accompanying comments in a timely manner. Thanks for checking out the post."

I'm selling a Tofu60 that i heavily modified. I took out the 4 middle posts leaving the side posts and added a gasket o-ring similar to a bakeneko. I painted the case white as it was purple. The paint came out pretty good the only marks are on the back left of the case but may be able to fix it. I also did the pe foam mod. The keycaps are included with the board.

Here is a [soundtest](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1We7J_0lYf_GY4O1JDscidRQLA57cCwZm/view?usp=sharing) that's not the best since it's recorded on my phone but it's the best i could do at the moment to give an idea what it sounds like

Price: $200 OBO Shipped

Hey MM!

I have a few items for sale:

* **SOLD** **~~Moon Rama U80-A Hotswap~~**~~. I'm sad to let this one go, but it's been sitting on my desk not getting much use and I'd love for it to go to a better home. It's in excellent condition with only one tiny visible mark on the outer case (see photos). Other than that there are some light scratches on the plate from switch pulling but nothing that's visible when assembled. The back weight has some fingerprints and light marks but nothing deep or noticeable from a distance. This is Seq 1 so the weight and plate are both in the polished Moon color and the board will come with tuned Durock stabs and the Rama internal dampener. Comes with original box but~~ **~~no~~** ~~original accessories.~~ [~~Soundtest w/ ePBT Notion, L+F banana splits, and the internal dampener~~](https://imgur.com/mS6sDQh) ~~(recorded directly on iPhone).~~
* **SOLD** **~~MT3 Extended 2048 kit~~**~~. I went all in on MT3 and after 15 minutes of typing realized that high profile is just not for me. Not looking to separate at this time. Retail for all kits was over $250 and several are no longer in stock on Drop. Mounted on a Sunsetter so the majority of the keys/sets have never been used and only opened to check quality. Alphas and mods were typed on for less than 15 minutes.~~
* **SOLD** **~~KAT Alpha base + add on~~**~~. Bought from another user on~~ r/mm\~\~, came installed on a Savage65 and thought I would add them to another board but decided to stick with cherry profile. Base set has been used and were a little loose when installed on mauves so be aware.\~\~

Yo yo,

Ever seen a keycap set that stole your heart? You then buy it, take pictures of them and realise you are never going to be able to type on them since they only have dots on 'm, no letters? That's exactly why I'm selling them! Up for sale:

* [GMK Dots R1 Base](https://imgur.com/a/nzUDvjy): used for pictures like these, and then put back in the box to never use them again. Have not been used. **€ 280**
* [XD60 with keycaps](https://imgur.com/a/DE77tMk): Really want to get rid of this one. Nice starter board, comes with a great variety of backlight and has MX Reds. Comes with the keycaps. **€ 45**

For shipping, I opt for Chunghwa post (significantly cheaper, and have shipped numerous times now without issue), but if you'd like FedEx/DHL (From experience, >$170 to the US), I can also try to quote. Note that I cannot be responsible for shipment issues after handling the items over to the courier.

Due to COVID-19, some countries have significant **extra shipping fees (Currently known: Canada, Australia, Switzerland...etc)**. While some **do not have this extra fee (Currently known: Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, USA...etc)**.

I'm selling a Tofu60 that i heavily modified. I took out the 4 middle posts leaving the side posts and added a gasket o-ring similar to a bakeneko. I painted the case white as it was purple. The paint came out pretty good the only marks are on the back left of the case but may be able to fix it. I also did the pe foam mod. The keycaps are included with the board.

Will include the original build (DZ60, durock stabs, aluminum plate and silent red switches if you want to desolder it to take the plate). Looking to get $125 shipped OBO.

Hi MechMarket,

It comes with all the standard accessories (plate, hotswap pcb, o-ring, stabilizers, carrying case, cloth, daughter board) as well as an unused solderable pcb and an extra o-ring. The board is in really good shape but has a ding on the front side of the case, it isn't noticeable when in use as you have to look for it to see it. **Does not include the switches or keycaps that are pictured**~~ **PENDING**

~~I am not open to trades and am looking to get **$190 USD before shipping.** Open to shipping it anywhere as long as it is paid for completely. Local to 85706.~~ **PENDING**

I am also selling a GMK Toxic Base Kit, it has been mounted one time for pictures, otherwise un-used. **I am looking to get $210 USD before shipping** Open to shipping it anywhere as long as it is paid for completely. Local to 85706. 

I am open to offers, as long as they are reasonable. I am not looking to split up any of the Bakeneko accessories unless I can find a buyer for what is being split at the same time. If you have any questions please pm me, happy to answer. Also willing to make a deal if you want to purchase both of my items. Thanks!"

Hey there, bought the GMK Olivia Dark kit as well as the spacebar kit to be used as accents with the GMK Minimal kit. Wasn't too happy with the colors and I'd much rather use EPBT to get the lighter color I want. I'm eyeing the EPBT Grayscale Spacebar pink spacebar kit. Selling the base kit and spacebar kit for **$350 shipped** The base kit will be shipped in bags and the spacebar kit will be in its original packaging.

|[Fox Labs F80SE](https://imgur.com/a/XImhNz9)|Built up my e-white time80, which I absolutely love (konpeitou switches/GMK ashes) so I'm selling my other e-white fox labs board.  There is nothing wrong with the board, I just don't need two e-white boards from fox labs.  Compared to the time80, this board is much heavier and also comes with a ""3rd ann."" tag that is removable.  The board has been desoldered and comes with lubed c3 stabs already installed on the PCB.  Just need to solder in switches and you're good to go!  Comes with plate foam, alu plate, desoldered PCB with stabs installed, and original packaging.  I purchased this board for $650 brand new.|~~$600~~ $575 shipped conus OBO|
|[~~80x ghost silent linear switches~~](https://imgur.com/a/T2w9DPy)|~~cleanly desoldered from my f80SE using hakko desoldering pump.  These are lubed and filmed silent linears that I purchased for $130.  I used them for a very short time since I didn't really like the sound (or rather, the lack of sound) that these switches gave off.  I decided I like to hear my switches.  They are in really good shape!  It's the only silent linear I've ever used, so I can't really compare it to anything, but the community member I bought them from compared them to silent alpacas.~~|~~$70 $65 shipped conus OBO~~ **Sold for $55 shipped**|

DSA Deepspace: Almost all of the kits, there may be a couple novelty keys missing but otherwise it is complete and shine free. The only other issue is that I modified the original 6.25 u spacebar and it is cut up as you can see.  I replaced it with another spacebar but the color is slightly off. **Trades ONLY**

NK Vaporwave: Complete set, used with some very minor shine on some keys. Hard to even show it in pictures. ~~Prioritizing trades / $65.00 Shipped~~ SOLD

KUL87 w/ MX Blacks and a Tai Hao Keyset. I custom painted this as you can see in the photos. It is a color shift purple / green with a design painted on the back (The word bubble is just vinyl but the design is painted on). There are some paint blemishes but overall it is in great condition. For this keyboard I am looking to get ~~$50 shipped~~ SOLD

I am selling my SM keyboards TKL. It is transparent purple and teal with a copper plate. It has a Hineybush 87a PCB and is finished off with Kailh Box Blacks. It has GMK stabilizers, but keep in mind the spacebar stabilizer should probably be replaced. It works fine but it a bit sluggish and quite noisy currently. The tabs holding the bar in place broke so I had to replace them with a dab of hot glue as pictured. A new stabilizer would fix this issue. If you have any questions feel free to ask. ~~$125 shipped~~ SOLD

The wrist rests were all made by me and are priced as follows:

TKL Teal / Purple Holographic: 14.00"" Excellent condition, no blemish's on the top, some blemishes on the bottom, feet come pre mounted. Looking to get **$30 shipped**

Hi everyone! Selling some stuff to make room for some other stuff. Mostly looking to sell, but happy to entertain trade offers. Local to the Bay Area. Not FCFS.

~~Box75 Prototype Keyboard Built by Alexotos
This is a really great board that I picked up from a great seller here on MM. It was built by Alexotos (you can watch the abbreviated build steam [HERE](https://youtu.be/X0w6kEOPNjw) ) with NK Silk Yellow w/ Krytox 205g0 & TX films. It sounds and feels great, I'm just overwhelmed with 75s at the moment and I hope to find someone who will give it some more use. Only change I've made is adding the Tempest tape mod. Caps not included.~~

~~Looking to get what I paid: $650 shipped CONUS.~~ **SOLD $630**

* Voice65 Bundle
I also have a black Voice65 built with Stupid fish foam, l/f Alpacas, white f4r plate on a hotswap PCB. It also includes a soldered PCB that is currently built with Daybreak switches, pc plate and the silicone ""foam"" it came with. One thing to note: The right pin of the Enter stabilizer is missing. It was stuck, but I was able to get it out. Key actuates just fine, but it will tilt if you push on the right side. Finally, it also comes with an extra aluminum plate.

Hi folks, trying to get rid of some stuff I seldom/never used so it gets a new home instead of collecting dust! Detailed pictures of the items for sale are in the timestamp as well as when you click on the hyperlink of each item!

Please comment before PM, no chat, thanks (there is an auto-generated comment down below where you can click for PM).

Prices include PayPal fees, but not shipping and they are based on what I paid and/or the amount of work I put in. Shipping is ca. 5€ in Germany, ca. 12€ in EU, depends on the size of the item. Shipping is EU-only, sorry!

Have a good one! =)

|Item|Description|Condition.|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Labyrinth 75|Elite C USB Micro Controller. SP Star Orange Switches on most of the board. **Two switches under the Elite C are unsolderable due to the controller hence the 1 mx black and 1 box jade.** Switches are lubed with trybosis 3203, 105 oil on springs and yellow 1.5mm TX Switch Films. GMK Stabilizers lubed and tuned on mods. The spacebar SP Star Orange has a bit of leaf ping but happy to replace with another switch. Has Bumper feet to give the board a typing angle. Has a 1 out of 2, Special Pink sticker on the bottom plate. **DOES NOT COME WITH KEYCAPS.**|Around 6 months of consistent use. Missing one screw at the top but can easily be replaced. Board is in otherwise very good condition. Switches are just a few months old as well and still feel smooth.|£100 Shipped in the UK.|
|HHKB Pro 2|2020 HHKB Pro 2, lubed with trybosis 3204 lightly on rails, stabilizers tuned with dielectric grease and 205g0, keyclack v2 silencing rings across the board. The DEL keycap in the upper right hand corner is missing so I'm throwing in the raven artisan for free. Shelf liner in case for sound dampening.|Around a few months old and has been used weekly on a regular basis. The board feels better than ever due to the breaking in nicely. As mentioned in the description, the DEL key is missing so I'm throwing in a free topre artisan as it's replacement. DEL can be moved or layered on the HHKB if necessary.|~~£115 Shipped in the UK~~   SOLD!|
|100x JWK FFFF Switches|Alpaca v2 Recolours, same specs as an Alpaca switch. Comes pre-lubed.|Mounted once for a sound test, one switch was soldered on but has been desoldered cleanly and works just fine even on hotswap.|£48 Shipped in the UK.|

&#x200B;

More info:

\- Happy to desolder and sell the Labyrinth 75 as just the kit (besides the two unsolderable switches) at no extra cost. I am willing to offer a discount if you buy the board without switches.

\- BUNDLE: If you buy all 3 items I'm happy to lower the total price of the items to £225 Shipped in the UK (Down from £268 if you buy altogether).

\- All boards will be thoroughly cleaned upon sale with compressed air and anti-bacterial wipes to ensure there is little to no marks/dust on the boards.

Item | Price | Description
---|---|---
Return 60 | 375 | I received it from the GB few small marks on the weight, but it's so small and anodized over that it can only be seen at certain angles. Otherwise the board is in good condition. Comes with desoldered bootmapper PCB and original box.
Zer0.9 EE | 500 | Desoldered once, no blemishes. Comes with c^3 PCB and iron plate.
HHHH Salamander | 700 | Has a few issues. The previous owner had the case powder coated, and I think some screws are hard to get in as a result. Weight has a good amount of patina but can easily been cleaned. Alu plate was spray painted by previous owner and has some rough spots especially around the edges. [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/C3TsEqq). Comes with desoldered H87a.
UTD 360c | 300 | Desoldered pcb. Back right corner is dented and one of the alignment tabs is sheared, but the case closes normally ([pics](https://imgur.com/a/K42oQlx)). I don't know how this happened and am not the original owner.
Mekanisk Klippe S | 250 | Missing a plate screw. Plate and PCB around one switch is scratches, but not visible since that switch is under the blocker. I don't know how this happened and am not the original owner. [Pic](https://i.imgur.com/SeKfxbx.jpg).
GMK Modern Dolch Light base | 230 | Sealed.
BSP green/beige | 150 | [Layout](https://i.imgur.com/ygvy5kI.jpg). Good condition.
OTD DCS Soware | 160 | [Layout](https://i.imgur.com/lYgGFHI.jpg). Small scratch on shift key ([pic](https://i.imgur.com/uHoTbfv.jpg)) but otherwise like new condition.

Hello Mechmarket,

School is starting back up for me soon and with in person classes making a comeback, I need to create a safety net for expenses related to commuting, which means I need to find new homes for my keyboards.

What I have available are as follows:

[LCK75](https://imgur.com/a/r3s9hha), Soldered L&F ThiccThock Marshmallows, ePBT x GOK Black on White, POM Plate. Hand soldered it myself, pics of the connections can be provided if necessary. Has silencing foam, an OLED screen, and a rotary encoder. Really nice keyboard but the switches I got for them ended up being a bit too overlubed, so I barely used the board. The acrylic was also not accurately cut, so I ended up having to sand the case in a few areas (namely the arrow keys, right shift, and two of the function row clusters) but as of right now, the board is pristine and ready to go. Asking $350 shipped with the keycaps, $300 without, price is OBO.

[~~Bifrost Acrylic Alice~~](https://imgur.com/a/AGL5V7q)~~, Hotswap Sneakbox USB-C PCB, L&F Everglide Waterkings, GMK Nightrunner clone from Amazon. If you like Alice keyboards or are looking to get one, look no further. Keyboard works perfectly with no problems. The only downside I would say is that the split right shift and FN key are soldered in (you can see it in the pictures) because the PCB didn't have hotswap sockets in those spots.  I ended up barely using this one after I had ordered the case for it since I missed having arrow keys and the cluster on the right. Typing test~~ [~~here~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fCC_FMdxWU)~~. Asking $250 shipped with keycaps $220 without.~~    SOLD

[Tokyo60 V4](https://imgur.com/a/kNOGo8q), ""Coyote"" colorway, L&F 62g Banana Splits (68g Durock POM switches on mods), stabs that came with the kit, no acrylic diffuser layer. Ordered this because I wanted to try the HHKB layout but ended up not liking it due to relying on left control too much. If you look at the images for it, you can see that one screw is missing, it came missing from Amazon but I felt that there was no need to try and return it to get a new screw. Asking $220 shipped but can bundle with one of the extra keycap sets I have for $250 shipped.

All of these keyboards have lubed stabs its just been so long since I actually participated in any keyboard talk that I can't remember which brands they are.

The other stuff I have for sale are just parts and can be bundled with anything for a discount

[~~Clear acrylic Arisu~~](https://imgur.com/a/hB1HH5p) ~~by Nico and Steph Studios with unknown PCB and Durock screw in stabs. Got the PCB from mechmarket with switches already in it, ended up desoldering but never got around to rebuilding the board. Asking $130 shipped but can bundle with keycaps for $150~~    SOLD

[~~Glass green acrylic Lubrigante~~](https://imgur.com/a/eHLiFhM) ~~case. Standard Lubrigante case with half plate. Works best with a soldered PCB. I had to sand a few areas down because the original owner of the case got it printed in such a way that obstructed the left space and right shift. The sanding is unnoticeable when built. Asking $60 shipped.~~  SOLD

~~JTK Night Sakura clone: $40 shipped as is~~ SOLD

ePBT Kuro Shiro clone: $40 shipped as is

Comment then PM please, chats will be ignored. International shipping can be done as long as shipping is covered by the buyer.

|[Fox Labs F80SE](https://imgur.com/a/XImhNz9) | Built up my e-white time80, which I absolutely love (konpeitou switches/GMK ashes) so I'm selling my other e-white fox labs board.  There is nothing wrong with the board, I just don't need two e-white boards from fox labs.  Compared to the time80, this board is much heavier and also comes with a ""3rd ann."" tag that is removable.  The board has been desoldered and comes with lubed c3 stabs already installed on the PCB.  Just need to solder in switches and you're good to go!  Comes with plate foam, alu plate, desoldered PCB with stabs installed, and original packaging.  I purchased this board for $650 brand new.|$600 shipped conus OBO|
|[80x ghost silent linear switches](https://imgur.com/a/T2w9DPy) | cleanly desoldered from my f80SE using hakko desoldering pump.  These are lubed and filmed silent linears that I purchased for $130.  I used them for a very short time since I didn't really like the sound (or rather, the lack of sound) that these switches gave off.  I decided I like to hear my switches.  They are in really good shape!  It's the only silent linear I've ever used, so I can't really compare it to anything, but the community member I bought them from compared them to silent alpacas.  |$70 shipped conus OBO|

I am also looking for these boards/things that I would like to trade my f80SE for but also add paypal if needed.

Hello, back with another post! Got some bills to pay, so I have to let some things go. I normally would strike through product descriptions, but I will leave them up to help guide those who are looking to purchase any of the items listed below. 

Only shipping to USA addresses at the moment. **CURRENTLY NOT TAKING ANY TRADE OFFERS.** All prices include **USPS Priority Mail** shipping costs. Please feel free to offer if it means that these things get out of my hands and into yours.

~~If you are local to 94706, I am fine doing local pickup/meetup and will lower price to reflect it.~~ forgot to remove this part on the account that I'm starting graveyard shifts at work soon.

If you're compelled to make an offer, feel free to do so. I need this thing gone and into a better home. | $525 shipped | yes!
GMK Black Modi | Like new, mounted only once. I bought this thinking I needed a second set of it, but turns out I don't need it after all. Shipped in bags. | ~~$100 shipped~~ | **SOLD FOR ASKING PRICE**

Priority for responding to offers will be as follows:

 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing all items for asking price (will give discount for purchasing all items listed here because holy moly that means you have money)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any bundle of the TMO50v2 + artisan for asking price (will give discount accordingly)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing the TMO50v2 for asking price
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any bundle of the GMK Black Modi + artisan for asking price (will give discount accordingly)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any bundle of artisans for asking price (will give discount accordingly)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any one item for asking price

Outside of the listed conditions, I'll check based on when you comment **and** PM. The PM is absolutely necessary for the sale of these items. Since I've had this happen before, if there are two people interested in the same item, but one is willing to pay no questions asked while the other has questions or wants to see more pics, I'm 100% selling to the person who will pay no questions asked. Requests for additional pictures will also take longer than you think, so please consider that when trying to secure an item.

Please understand that if you as a buyer and I agree on a price and you back out of the purchase right after I send the invoice, I will refuse to sell anything to you in the future (yes, that includes if you offer me something like $300 on something that I'm selling for much less). 

 **Do not use the chat function**, I honestly don't know how you are taken to the chat function when the bot's verification post gives you a link to PM sellers. I will ignore you and you won't be in consideration for anything until you send me a PM. I will also ignore you if you do not comment before sending a PM.

If I don't respond, it's likely because I'm just busy doing other things. I will get to all messages accompanying comments in a timely manner. Thanks for checking out the post."

I'm selling most of my keyboard collection, since they are not getting any use and it's time to pass them on.

I'll be shipping this in the UK **only**. I believe trying to ship anywhere in EU would be a lot of trouble and incur customs tax, but feel free to message me if you have an idea about shipping costs etc.

Shipping costs for each item will depend on number of items, will work this out with each individual buyer.

If you need any more pics, let me know.

   * ~~Full base kit with ISO-UK options too. The 7u spacebar does not fit in the GMK case as previous seller combined the ISO-UK keys with base set, so is tucked under the card cover.~~
   * ~~No noticeable shine to note, happy to provide additional photos to those in the timestamp if need be.~~
   * ~~I have noticed that some of the white pegs that hold the two plastic sheets together do not snap into place properly. Doesnt seem to cause any issues with securely closing the case.~~
   * ~~Looking for:~~ **~~£150 SOLD~~**

* **~~Infinkey x TKC Port~~**
   * ~~Same as above - used lightly by previous seller and surplus to my requirements so looking to give a new home.~~

Base kit & Blue RAMA were mounted once & used for about 4 days. White RAMA is still new & never mounted/used (I only opened package to look at it). Along with the timestamp photos, I included manufacturing defects on the Home & F7 key because selling this kit without letting you guys know of these defects didn't sit well with my conscience. Those marks are NOT from use (in otherwords NOT caused by me). I tried my best to remove them with isopropyl alcohol when I first installed these keycaps but they wouldn't come off. Maybe you guys know a better way to get marks off plastic.

I LOVE the way these keycaps sound & their silky smooth surface compared to other PBT/GMK keycaps that have a rough matte surface. But I cannot use the unsculpted SA profile for my life. I thought I would like it over DSA or XDA since it's a higher profile but nope I just can't use unsculpted sets. I just don't like it. These keycaps would've been perfect if they were cherry or OEM IMO."

Selling stuff I just don't use anymore.

Prices all include shipping costs and shipped through either USPS or UPS. International is okay if you're willing to pay extra costs. Local is Westchester, N.Y. (specifically New Rochelle) and I'll offer a discount for picking things up from my place (father of a newborn = life saver if I don't have to go out to ship). No trades. Not FCFS: I will prioritise those that have more trades and feedback, and local sales.

Hello, back with another post! Got some bills to pay, so I have to let some things go. I normally would strike through product descriptions, but I will leave them up to help guide those who are looking to purchase any of the items listed below. 

Only shipping to USA addresses at the moment. **CURRENTLY NOT TAKING ANY TRADE OFFERS.** All prices include **USPS Priority Mail** shipping costs. Please feel free to offer if it means that these things get out of my hands and into yours.

**If you are local to 94706, I am fine doing local pickup/meetup and will lower price to reflect it.**

Item|Details|Price|Available
:--|:--|:--|:--
smoke PC TMO50v2 | smoky PC case with PCB cleanly de-soldered using an FR-301. yes, this board ran recently but smoke PC didn't make a return as a color. great board, but honestly it's just been sitting on a shelf for the past few months with little to no use. weight has a few spots of patina/tarnish/whatever you want to call it. comes with Cannonkeys carrying case. If you're compelled to make an offer, feel free to do so. I need this thing gone and into a better home. | $550 shipped | yes!
silent T1 switches x70 | I only bought these because I didn't want to buy only keyboard feet from PrimeKB. I have no use for these. The price after shipping is less than what I paid for at retail. | $50 shipped | yes!
Pink Haze Bukkakey | by Bad n' Booj. **price is below what I paid retail** | $60 shipped | yes!
Magenta Crayons Eggface v2 | by ETF/Nightcaps. part of the 420 sale this year. **price is below what I paid retail** | $60 shipped First Class | yes
Pika Lucky Cat | by Ko Caps. sold as FCFS when originally released. | $60 shipped First Class | yes!
Beggy Phuck | by Rejeck Kaps. I'm not sure why I entered for this one, I didn't even get GMK Greg. Price is less than I paid when I won the raffle. | $60 shipped First Class | yes!
Melodic Confetti r1 blank | by Latrialum. includes auth card. someone else sold this cap for $225 shipped within the past few weeks, but they deleted their sale prices from their post. | ~~$160 shipped priority mail~~ | **SOLD**



Priority for responding to offers will be as follows:

 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing all items for asking price (will give discount for purchasing all items listed here because holy moly that means you have money)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any bundle of the TMO50v2 + artisan for asking price (will give discount accordingly)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing the TMO50v2 for asking price
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any bundle of artisans for asking price (will give discount accordingly)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any one item for asking price

Outside of the listed conditions, I'll check based on when you comment **and** PM. The PM is absolutely necessary for the sale of these items. Since I've had this happen before, if there are two people interested in the same item, but one is willing to pay no questions asked while the other has questions or wants to see more pics, I'm 100% selling to the person who will pay no questions asked. Requests for additional pictures will also take longer than you think, so please consider that when trying to secure an item.

Please understand that if you as a buyer and I agree on a price and you back out of the purchase right after I send the invoice, I will refuse to sell anything to you in the future (yes, that includes if you offer me something like $300 on something that I'm selling for much less). 

 **Do not use the chat function**, I honestly don't know how you are taken to the chat function when the bot's verification post gives you a link to PM sellers. I will ignore you and you won't be in consideration for anything until you send me a PM. I will also ignore you if you do not comment before sending a PM.

If I don't respond, it's likely because I'm just busy doing other things. I will get to all messages accompanying comments in a timely manner. Thanks for checking out the post."

A little explanation the b key has a little roughing to it on the side (not sure if it shows well but…). 

EPBT 9009 - bought from another user basically brand new and used for about two months pretty heavily. No shine but texture has rubbed off a little bit on the gamer keys and common letters. $80 shipped OBO 

KBD75V2 - Tealios and turquoise tealios (Lubed w/ 205g0, tx films, springs 105), genuine GMK screw in stabs (205g0 for housing and stem, clipped, wire dielectric grease) 
$180 shipped OBO 

Now longer explanation for the keyboard:

If you look at the time stamp there are videos. The first one is before they were retuned and second is after. It’s hard to tell the difference but in person it’s night and day. There is definitely a little too much dielectric grease but it does not interfere at all. Also the final picture is just to show the odd layout of switches used. Note gamer keys sound a little different due to being pressed more. I’m just being super transparent since I don’t want people to get something without knowing the history. 

Combined $230 shipped

[**Smoky Gray PC TMOv2 with FR4 & Brass Plate, Sealed PCB, Carrying Case, Microfiber Cloth (DOES NOT INCLUDE SWITCHES/STABS)**](https://imgur.com/a/iLaTaQE)

*$525 + shipping*

**Edit: Somebody expressed interest in purchasing only the FR4 plate, willing to sell TMOv2 bundle WITHOUT the FR4 plate for $500 + shipping**

Includes FR4 Plate, Brass Plate, Sealed PCB, Carrying Case and Microfiber Cloth + some stickers. 

(I can include the original desoldered PCB, but the top left most pad does not work, the PCB has been built 3 times and will be desoldered for a 4th time before shipping. You might be able to jump the pad.)

It has served me well and has seen lots of use. There are a few surface blemishes that are detailed in the above album, but are only visible at specific angles under harsh lighting. 

I will be desoldering the current PCB, so switches and stabs are not included.

Hi mechmarket, I would just like to sell these things I have no plans on using. Please comment before PM, and no chat please. 

1.) K6 Barebones- I used this to break in 3 sets of creams. I threw away the keycaps as they were trash. I honestly tried to spray paint the chassis and it’s pretty scuffed. I did not attempt to fix it as I was lazy. Selling for $50 shipped.

2.) 60% wooden hotswap- I wanted to try a wooden board that’s all. It’s super thocky and the pcb is KeebsForAll’s FB60. I am using regular ansi layout. Stabs are GMK screw in, except right shift, I have a snap in. I mounted only once. Comes with Alu Plate. The wooden case is connected to a wrist rest. Asking for $55 shipped

3.) UHWMPE Creams x90- Kinetic labs 70g springs lubed with 105 oil and stems and housings lightly lubed with 205g0. UHWMPE stems are INVYR version 1, batch 3. Never been mounted or soldered. I simply just have too many switches. Asking for $80 shipped.

4.) Navy Brutal60 WK Layout- Received this in a trade and due to poor packaging, it has received some small scratches(one on the bottom right, 2 to side of the case and one on the bottom left). It also has 2 dings at the back of the bottom of the case. Pcb is Instant60 hotswap with white leds, fr4 plate. Has GMK screw in tabs and one purple Durock for space bar. Currently has Kinetic labs Husky linears. Can sell barebones for $200 shipped or with switches for $250."

Kbdfans 8x black wkl: had for awhile built with tangies but it is now desoldered, all keys have been tested with plyers and are working. However I am not that smart and this has lead to many issues with the board. 1. The bottom right case screw \[secures top piece to bottom piece\] is stripped cuz i used too long of a screw and now the normal ones don't even mount in, longer screws are included but they don't fit that well. 2. I am missing screws, got replacement ones but they are flatheads and even with those I don't enough to fill them out. \[if you want to buy more just go to like autozone and ask for m2 6mm screws :) \]. 3. Idk wut i did here but its hella rusted or something not too sure, can't see it with kepcaps on but its not it tbh. You could prolly just get a pom or alu plate or ponoko or mechmarket to replace it. 4. Pcb is desoldred as previously stated and although its pretty clean and a switch will easily it the top looks funny cuz of the residue from when i desoldered. 5. Final thing on the back while screwing in the screws I used way to big of a screwdriver and scraped up the screw holes, again can't see from normal use but flip it over and its pretty obvious. \[tangies not included\] I also have some insulator I used as case foam which i can throw in with the keyboard. The weight is pretty unscratched up, I'm pretty happy with the condition its in. 

Not too sure how much to ask for this one so ill put it at 230 OBO if price is unreasonable lmk

also if you have a cheap keyboard that isn't a full size you want to trade with that would be cool too as this is my only keyboard as of rn

also since I won't be using the keyboard anymore I don't really need any of the accessories so im giving away a switch puller, keycap puller, dielectric grease, and a switch opener just be local. Will also include a 8008 themed aviator cable I won this in a giveaway so it feels wrong to change somebody for it, really well built but prolly won't be buying gmk 8008 to match it anytime soon.

selling for 10$ 

Also willing to trade for nike mid 77 blazers i think im a size 10 or 11 

priority will be give to local: 92708 but willing to ship the 8x not the accessories.    Edit: both are pending as of right now"

**DZ60**

Here to sell my old first board. The board is made out of the following components

Lubed Alpaca v2 switches (Bottom rails, leaf, spring, and stem all lubed with 205g0)

Cherry Clip in Stabs (Clipped and tuned with 205g0)

DZ60 Aluminum plate (Layout A, seen [here](https://kbdfans.com/collections/60-layout-plate-1/products/dz60-cnc-aluminum-plate?variant=39293765058699))

DZ60RGB Soldered PCB (Has been desoldered once, a couple keys desoldered to test switches, everything works fine though)

60% Bamboo Case (Seen [here](https://kbdfans.com/collections/60-layout-case/products/60-bamboo-case))

Everything on the board works great, can include the TaiHao doubleshot caps seen on the board, have the full set (Which can be seen [here](https://shop.tai-hao.com/products/abs-104-c01wa301)) for 20$ extra

edit: board is soldered for stepped caps, can desolder to fix that, but will favor offers that dont require that

Looking for 125 shipped or any offered trades, 145 shipped with tai hao caps.

**88x Salmon Switches**

Lubed with 3204 (Only on spring and rails of stem and bottom housing, to preserve tactility) Looking for 60$ shipped

~~-~~ [~~Clarabelle (e-white)~~](https://imgur.com/gallery/Geh6IW2) ~~- $525~~

~~Board is quite literally brand new in box as seen in the photos, and will be shipped in the original cannon keys box with all the accessories it came with. I had originally bought two boards, one in the mystery color and this e-white version. I ended up building the lilac (mystery colored) one, and the e-white one has been sitting in the box unused ever since. the board has never been built, and has only been opened for visual inspections. the only imperfection that can be found on the outside of the board is a very small blemish in the e-white coating on the front case, and on the inside where the e-white coating has been removed on the centering tabs of the top case from the brass plate being placed on. I tried to capture both of these in the photos attaches as best I could.~~ SOLD

\- [Clarabelle (lilac)](https://imgur.com/gallery/pTufA6Z) \- $550

Board is as close to brand new as it gets. I purchased the board at the same time as the e-white board above, built it, put it through an hour or two at most of monkeytype tests, and benched it from there onward. I just could not get used to the layout of the board as much as I wanted to keep the board in my rotation. There is absolutely zero imperfections, and the anodization looks (to my eyes at least) flawless. The color is great, lovely looking board, as I said; just not for me. The board is built with lubed/filmed lilac switches and durock V2 stabilizers. Will come packaged the exact same way as the other board.

#Haves:

- **TGR - Jane V2 CE** - $5000

WKL/Rainbow weight. Built with H88 PCB on the carbon fiber plate, Cherry Vint Blacks (TX Films, TX 60g springs, lubed with 205g0), clipped/bandaid pretooled screw in GMK stabs (lubed with 205g0.) Comes with 2 original PCBs, gasket and the extra original aluminum plate. There are a few scratches on the weight (see pics.) Other than that, nothing to note really.

- ~~**BroCaps - Reaper v1 - Black Jack** - $300~~ - SOLD

- ~~**GMK Oblivion R2 - Git Base & Cadets** - $225 or trades~~ - SOLD

Has been used. Pretty good condition. There is some shine on the modifiers (mainly left shift) and the cadet alphas but nothing crazy. Original alphas are completely unused. I (obviously) have the original box but will ship in bags. I can ship in the original packaging but it will be a bit extra.

- **GMK Oblivion R1 - Hagaromo Base** - $175 or trades

Used quite a bit and I'd say the alphas are fairly shiny but the set is still in really good shape. Will ship in bags. 

- ~~**Summit Cables - LE Nebula** - $60~~ - SOLD

Lightly used. USB A to Mini/Black Heatshrink/3ft length/4"" coil

**KEYBOARDS**

[**Smoky Gray PC TMOv2 with FR4 & Brass Plate, Sealed PCB, Carrying Case, Microfiber Cloth (DOES NOT INCLUDE SWITCHES/STABS)**](https://imgur.com/a/iLaTaQE)

*$525 + shipping*

**Edit: Somebody expressed interest in purchasing only the FR4 plate, willing to sell TMOv2 bundle WITHOUT the FR4 plate for $500 + shipping**

Includes FR4 Plate, Brass Plate, Sealed PCB, Carrying Case and Microfiber Cloth + some stickers. 

(I can include the original desoldered PCB, but the top left most pad does not work, the PCB has been built 3 times and will be desoldered for a 4th time before shipping. You might be able to jump the pad.)

It has served me well and has seen lots of use. There are a few surface blemishes that are detailed in the above album, but are only visible at specific angles under harsh lighting. 

I will be desoldering the current PCB, so switches and stabs are not included.

Item | Price | Description |

**GMK Bushido Bundle (Base, Spacebars, Desk pad)** |  *$320 + shipping* **Deskpad pending** | Looking for bundle buyers first, will consider splitting later on if no one buys.  Base Kit was opened for inspection but never mounted. Spacebars kit is unopened. The desk pad has some indents on the right side (visible in time stamp) from hanging from a clip-on hanger after washing. You might be able to remove them by steaming or some other method. 
**Yellow Keyreative Blanks** | *$25 shipped* | From TKC, light use, no ""new"" shine, these keycaps are normally pretty smooth and slightly shiny when new.

Note that if you buy more than one item then I'll drop the price by $10 for *each* item you add (e.g. base kit/aesthetic kit + 1 RAMA keycap + deskpad = $20 off). And I will not split the base kit/aesthetic kit bundles.

Moving more stuff I don't really use anymore. I love the laser colorway but money talks louder at the moment. I mostly used the gaijin alphas, and I'm pretty sure the cyberdeck alphas are basically untouched. I might've mounted it onto a board once to take some pictures.

These will come shipped in bags since the flimsy original GMK packaging fell apart right when I opened it. There is some slight shine on the keycaps that I rest my hands on(e.g. wasd, spacebar). Scuffed video attempting to show the shine in timestamp album.

Arctangent Design02 built with lubed NK Creams and GMK stabilizers and a KBD67 PCB. The board was not used much as I really don't like Linears all that much and I have really just been using my 60% collection lately. I am looking to get ~~$225 shipped~~ SOLD

KUL87 w/ MX Blacks and a Tai Hao Keyset. I custom painted this as you can see in the photos. It is a color shift purple / green with a design painted on the back (The word bubble is just vinyl but the design is painted on). There are some paint blemishes but overall it is in great condition. For this keyboard I am looking to get $60 shipped

I am selling my SM keyboards TKL. It is transparent purple and teal with a copper plate. It has a Hineybush 87a PCB and is finished off with Kailh Box Blacks. It has GMK stabilizers, but keep in mind the spacebar stabilizer should probably be replaced. It works fine but it a bit sluggish and quite noisy currently. The tabs holding the bar in place broke so I had to replace them with a dab of hot glue as pictured. A new stabilizer would fix this issue. If you have any questions feel free to ask. $130 shipped

The wrist rests were all made by me and are priced as follows:

TKL Teal / Purple Holographic: 14.00"" Excellent condition, no blemish's on the top, some blemishes on the bottom, feet come pre mounted. Looking to get $35 shipped

60% Supreme Glitter Blurple: 11.75"" Excellent condition, no blemish's on the top, with some defects and sanded edges on the bottom. Will come with feet that are not attached. Looking to get $35 shipped

Hello all, looking to let go of my Polaris and other small items/artisans. **GMK Dolch keycaps and Hyperglide switches shown in timestamps not included.** PrevailKey Hotswap PCB + Plate will not be sold separate from the Polaris, unless the Polaris buyer does not want them. In which case, I will sell the PCB+Plate together afterwards (will not split that either, price determined later).


Please check timestamps for minor cosmetic flaws on the Polaris, as well as the detailed description in the table.


Prices are in USD and do not include shipping - invoices will likely be in CAD with google exchange rate.


**Please comment before PM'ing, and include zip code + country if you want a quicker shipping quote.** For Polaris, I may be able to ship in the original very plain KBDfans box from the extras round from March/April.

Hotswap PCB comes with an internal dampener, mute, and mirror-polished PVD brass weight. Back weight has a minuscule scratch that is only visible when looking from behind in specific light. The case is in flawless condition minus 2 tiny nicks (detailed in pics and are not visible when used). The entire case has been clear cerakoted to avoid any more scratches or dings and will allow the finish to last a lot longer. Comes with Holee modded c3 stabs lubed with 205g0 on the exterior and bdz on the wires.

* **Tofu 60:** The keyboard is in excellent conditions and I can't see any cosmetic defects, dents, scratches or cracks in the casing. The keyboard sounds great to me and I really love it but I found myself really missing arrow keys and got a Tofu65. | DZ60RGB v2 Hotswap, PC Plate & Foam Has 205g0 + 105 on Spring Lubed Black Inks + Durock v2 205g0 Lubed Stabs Pictured keycaps are also included, they were like $28 on Amazon - nothing fancy but I actually like them. **$265 Shipped**

* **NK65 Clear NK65 EE Clear | Gateron Aliaz Silent | Infinikey BoW Keycaps** [Original Seller's Description]: I have a love/hate relationship with the NK65. I think its a great price and feels good, but I've used multiple versions of it and it has a lot of problems. For this board in particular, the top right mounting post has cracked and been removed. There is a cracked plate mounting point in top right (~~[~~see image~~](https://i.imgur.com/lAKKCqd.jpg)~~). The ESC key hotswap socket popped off and I had to re-solder it myself and I added some hot glue to further reinforce it. There are also some small scratches on the plate from the switch puller; these can't be seen when switches are in the keyboard. 

I built this board to get close to my beloved HHKB. But it's still an MX board so it's more like typing on a tactile keyboard while someone yells *Topre!* from another room. Here is a [**sound test**](https://youtu.be/fFwWND8tQYY). I still love the way it sounds/feels. Adhesive foam has been added to the underside of the plate, and the stock stabs have been modded with dialectric grease and electric tape. The Aliaz switches have been lightly lubed with 3204, the ones that had bad housing wobble have been filmed (so not all of them), and those terrible springs have been swapped with 60g springs from retired Cherry blues. Note: the spacebar switch has a 70g spring. I don't really recommend taking this keyboard apart, it's good to go right out of the box.**$160 Shipped**

* **GMK Mito Laser Cyberdeck Set + Gaijin** - Purchased June 2, 2021 from Drop and they arrived June 11th. I took some time to mount them because I wasn't sure what keyboard I wanted to use. I've used them from that point on until about a month ago when I bought some Fauxlivias on mechmarket. I think some of the fps keys have a barely visible hint of shine. The Cyberdeck, non Japanese key caps have zero use whatsoever and have never been mounted. Only the Gaijin/Japanese key caps have been used (and of course one of the space bars!) Every single key will be included from the Cyberdeck and Gaijin sets you get from Drop - I can't include the original box and trays because for whatever reason I can't get them to stack properly. The trays are quite cheap though and made of what's basically thick paper, not even the thickness of thin cardboard. I can also split them up if two buyers line up that want Cyberdeck and Gaijin individually. Cyberdeck is currently sold out on Drop, I'm not sure if this affects pricing much or if they'll restock soon. **$260 Shipped**"

Not necessarily FCFS, as bundles will be prioritized. All prices are negotiable, so please feel free to make an offer if anything's too high or unfair.

Hello hello! I bought two Karas thinking I would want both of them but, turns out I like the iced version more than this moon colorway. No issues with the board, everything is working!

The only thing wrong with the board is that one of the feet behind the board needed super glue to stick on the board. When making the board I ripped off the strip too fast from the feet and it made the stickiness go away. I hope that makes sense but they'll be photos to show you what I did.   (I posted this board saying the screw I lost was gone but I found it now so everything is okay with the USB port! It's safe and secure!)

My GMK Armstrong Base Kit was used a bit but, nothing is wrong with the set. I just prefer the Colombia base kit more and I need some money to purchase other things right now. Basically just trying to recover some money to spend or save on other things lol

Item | Price | Description

Return 60 | 375 | I received it from the GB few small marks on the weight, but it's so small and anodized over that it can only be seen at certain angles. Otherwise the board is in good condition. Comes with desoldered bootmapper PCB and original box.
Zer0.9 EE | 500 | Desoldered once, no blemishes. Comes with c^3 PCB and iron plate.
HHHH Salamander | 700 | Has a few issues. The previous owner had the case powder coated, and I think some screws are hard to get in as a result. Weight has a good amount of patina but can easily been cleaned. Alu plate was spray painted by previous owner and has some rough spots especially around the edges. [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/C3TsEqq). Comes with desoldered H87a.
Mekanisk Klippe S | 250 | Missing a plate screw. Plate and PCB around one switch is scratches, but not visible since that switch is under the blocker. I don't know how this happened and am not the original owner. [Pic](https://i.imgur.com/SeKfxbx.jpg).
GMK Modern Dolch Light base | 260 | Sealed.
BSP green/beige | 150 | [Layout](https://i.imgur.com/ygvy5kI.jpg). Good condition.
OTD DCS Soware | 160 | [Layout](https://i.imgur.com/lYgGFHI.jpg). Small scratch on shift key ([pic](https://i.imgur.com/uHoTbfv.jpg)) but otherwise like new condition.

Board is quite literally brand new in box as seen in the photos, and will be shipped in the original cannon keys box with all the accessories it came with. I had originally bought two boards, one in the mystery color and this e-white version. I ended up building and keeping the lilac (mystery colored) one, and the e-white one has been sitting in the box unused ever since. The board has never been built, and has only been opened for visual inspections when I first got it, and pictures just recently. The only imperfection that can be found on the outside of the board is a very small blemish in the e-white coating on the front case. There is also blemishes on the inside where the e-white coating has been removed on the centering tabs of the top case due to the brass plate being placed on. I tried to capture both of these in the photos attaches as best I could.

~~-~~ [~~Obliterated75~~](https://imgur.com/gallery/eXhEzlB) ~~- $285~~

~~This board was bought as B-stock. as you can see in the pictures, there is noticeable imperfections/damage in the paint on the right side of the case and the blocker. Outside of these there are no other imperfections, but the overall finish of the board is far from perfect simply due to the nature of the board/finish. If you have never seen one of these boards in person, do not expect an anodized like quality/feel. The board is built with Gateron hippos/Durock V2s, lubed with krytox 205g0, and switches are filmed with Durock switch films. It is also filled with zip n fit liner and polyfoam. The board sounds very deep and thocky and has been my daily driver work keyboard for quite some time, despite the number of high end boards in my collection, purely due to how great the typing feel from the sandwich mount is on it, and not needed to be worried 24/7 about damaging one of my high end boards when I am out at work. Unfortunately it is just time for this board and I to part ways, and I have listed the built board at the price I bought the kit alone for on cannon keys brand new for.~~ SOLD

Received my Grid 650 last week with a hotswap PCB.  
I traded the hotswap PCB for a solder one but realized I would rather get another board.  
The PCB had been soldered once by the previous user.  
Else my board has never been built and is new (I found 1 small mark on the inside, please look at pictures)  
If you need a hotswap or new PCB, Zfrontier/Grid still sells them.

Hello, I've been slowly falling out of this hobby. I just got these GMK Bushido keycaps today. However, 1 year of waiting later, I no longer really want them. So I'm selling them along with my Rama Jules that has been sitting in the box since the day I got it. Everything is brand new and never used. I opened the Rama Jules package just to do QA on the board and make sure there was no damages. I would like to sell everything as a bundle preferably."

Hi Mechmarket,

Trying this again with a price drop.  I have a set of brand new and unused alphas for the GMK Lasers. I ended up getting a gaijin set so I don't need the alphas. This would be great for a smaller build in the 45-60% range.

If interested I can throw in the split spacebar set and a few novelty extras.

Looking for SOLD plus shipping. Can either ship in the original cardboard tray or in a baggy within a USPS flat rate box.

Please pm me with any questions. Thank you!"

Hello, back with another post! Got some bills to pay, so I have to let some things go. I normally would strike through product descriptions, but I will leave them up to help guide those who are looking to purchase any of the items listed below. 

Only shipping to USA addresses at the moment. **CURRENTLY NOT TAKING ANY TRADE OFFERS.** All prices include **USPS Priority Mail** shipping costs.

**If you are local to 94706, I am fine doing local pickup/meetup and will lower price to reflect it.**

Item|Details|Price|Available
:--|:--|:--|:--
smoke PC TMO50v2 | smoky PC case with PCB cleanly de-soldered using an FR-301. yes, this board ran recently but smoke PC didn't make a return as a color. great board, but honestly it's just been sitting on a shelf for the past few months with little to no use. weight has a few spots of patina/tarnish/whatever you want to call it. comes with Cannonkeys carrying case. If you're compelled to make an offer, feel free to do so. I need this thing gone and into a better home. | $550 shipped | yes!
GMK Botanical novelties | bought these through ilumkb extras. they got stuck in Chicago's international sorting center, and by the time they got here, I didn't want them anymore. if you bought botanical r1 on mechmarket and still need novelties, come get them. I don't care if botanical r2 is live, GMK wait times are unbearable until proven otherwise. if you buy one of the keyboards listed above, you might be in for a special treat. Price is mostly firm on these because I need the keyboard listed above to move. | $120 shipped or **FREE WITH PURCHASE OF TMO50V2** | **SOLD FOR $120 SHIPPED**
Melodic Confetti r1 blank | by Latrialum. includes auth card. someone else sold this cap for $225 shipped the other day but they deleted their sale prices from their post. | $170 shipped priority mail | yes!
Pink Haze Bukkakey | by Bad n' Booj. **price is below what I paid retail** | $60 shipped | yes!
Pika Lucky Cat | by Ko Caps. sold as FCFS when originally released. | $60 shipped First Class | yes!
Magenta Crayons Eggface v2 | by ETF/Nightcaps. part of the 420 sale this year. **price is below what I paid retail** | $60 shipped First Class | yes

Priority for responding to offers will be as follows:

 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing all items for asking price (will give discount for purchasing all items listed here because holy moly that means you have money)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any bundle of either the Aegis or the TMO50v2 + artisan for asking price  (will give discount accordingly)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing the TMO50v2 for asking price
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any bundle of artisans for asking price (will give discount accordingly)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any one item for asking price

Outside of the listed conditions, I'll check based on when you comment **and** PM. The PM is absolutely necessary for the sale of these items. Since I've had this happen before, if there are two people interested in the same item, but one is willing to pay no questions asked while the other has questions or wants to see more pics, I'm 100% selling to the person who will pay no questions asked.

Please understand that if you as a buyer and I agree on a price and you back out of the purchase right after I send the invoice, I will refuse to sell anything to you in the future (yes, that includes if you offer me something like $300 on something that I'm selling for much less). 

 **Do not use the chat function**, I honestly don't know how you are taken to the chat function when the bot's verification post gives you a link to PM sellers. I will ignore you and you won't be in consideration for anything until you send me a PM. I will also ignore you if you do not comment before sending a PM.

If I don't respond, it's likely because I'm just busy doing other things. I will get to all messages accompanying comments in a timely manner. **For the fastest response time, you can add me on Discord through my tag lime#7175**. Thank you for your time."

Hello all, looking to let go of my Polaris and other small items/artisans.

Hi there

I am selling this unusual / very uncommon GMK set (Haven't seen a set listed in a long time now.) [Here](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=80942.0) is a link to the GB from well over 5 years ago.

I am looking for 250 USD. The set has been barely used, maybe just the alphas for a few weeks. The rest of the time I used the very similar 9009 so you can see why I am selling. I am definitely open to offers, as I was a bit unsure of the pricing myself. I set it at 250 based on limited availability, the uncommon R5 bottom row and extra keys it has, general pricing of GMK sets these days and the good condition it is in.

Shipping worldwide is 30 USD and shipping within Australia is free. Please note it comes in its own cute little themed box and no tray. 

Thanks!

Looking to sell my GMK Laser Synthwave keycaps in its original packaging. Purchased these from drop a while back to try out GMK and used them for about a month. Loved the sound and feel, but I realized that the eventual shine would bother me to no end, so I figured it would be best to switch back to PBT caps and let these go.

I examined all the keycaps and the only sign of wear I was able to notice was a bit of shine on the ""c"" key, so they're still in great condition overall. (refer to the later photos in the album)

Hey guys bummed this one didn't work out for me. Had this board a little over a week and my 11inch hands just dont work with the board and cause cramps. The board for the 40-50% style is amazing and I really wish I could use it. RAMA boards are super quality and I love the Yolk color.

RAMA M50-A YOLK built with lubed and filmed Alpacas and RAMA WHEY caps. Board will ship with the original RAMA box and all the fixings including the cable. no damage whatsoever to the board its literally brand new $620 SHIPPED.

I also included the photos of a GMK 9009 40% kit that if you didnt like the RAMA CAPS you could add on to the price making it 660 shipped.

As I am reducing my collection, sorry that trade is not considered in general but I won't stop you from trying. These are some popular sets so it should not be hard to find information about them.

Everything is priced to the last sold price and quite similar to the retail price, if I remember correctly. **All keysets are in their original boxes.** Please let me know if you prefer to ship them in Ziplocs, which could lead to cheaper shipping.

I'm moving overseas so looking to downsize.

[Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/cUNJzIZ)

**Switch Couture Electrotype 87 TKL - $200**

Bifrost Radiant colorway, a beautiful iridescent color that is a translucent green rainbow and really pops. It is USB-C. Switches are 67g C3 Dark Tangerine linear switches, lubed and filmed. Stabs are lubed and clipped Cream C3 screw-in stabilizers, with one Durock screw-in lubed and clipped one on the right shift key. Board comes with H87A solder PCB from 1upkeyboards, with under glow RGB controlled by VIA software. Comes with clear and carbon black PBT keycaps (both GMK).

Note: there is a cracked corner which occurred before my ownership. You can see it in the photos, and replacement acrylic can be sourced from Switch Couture if it bothers you. I never minded it. The price reflects the flaws on the board, please check pictures before PM.

**~~ePBT Extended 2048 Alphas/Icon/Mods - $150~~**       **Sold for asking**

~~These are a set of standard alphas and some icons/mods left over from my TKL build with the kanji alphas. Please check photos for which caps are included in this collection - it is not the full set.~~

**RAMA Polybius UV-reactive GLOW Metal Artisan Keycap - $120**

Brand new, sealed.

Hello all! Looking to clear out some space in my inventory! 

Note: All sales final. 

Obliterated75 A Stock (SOLD) - Used for about 4 months but in great condition. This board will come prebuilt with Lavender Linear switches lubed with Krytox 205g0 as well as pre lubed Durock smokey v2 stabs also lubed with 205g0. This board is burger mounted and is using poly fill for sound dampening and the included FR4 plate. The board will ship with the original Microfiber cloth and carrying case. Also, if you see any “hairs” in the timestamp pictures it is just small strands of poly fill that are peaking out of the case. These can easily be removed!

Tofu 65 ($100 + Shipping) (SOLD) - This board has been used on and off for about 2 years. The case is in great condition. Board will come “pre assembled” in traditional tray mount fashion but the plate is technically not latched to the PCB until switches are put in. This will include pre lubed (Krytox 205g0) GMK screw in stabs and the original unused USB C cable that came with the kit. The PCB is hot swap and has RGB under glow.

Selling a GMK Oblivion V2 Git base kit. I tried putting in onto a WIP build a while back but didn't like how it looked so I put it back into the packaging. I kept it for a couple of months in case I wanted to use it for something else, but recently decided to sell. The keys are like new, and have only received about 1 week's worth of light use as a test build."

Hello, back with another post! Got some bills to pay, so I have to let some things go. I normally would strike through product descriptions, but I will leave them up to help guide those who are looking to purchase any of the items listed below. 

Only shipping to USA addresses at the moment. **CURRENTLY NOT TAKING ANY TRADE OFFERS.** All prices include **USPS Priority Mail** shipping costs.

**If you are local to 94706, I am fine doing local pickup/meetup and will lower price to reflect it.**

Item|Details|Price|Available
:--|:--|:--|:--
AEboards Aegis | **Previous buyer backed out so this is back up for sale.** Southpaw 1800 layout. One of my grails, so this one hurts to let go. Built with 70g (16mm TX) Raeds lubed with GS2 and C3 stabs lubed with both 205g0 and Krytox XHT-BDZ. Comes with remaining Raeds. I bought this board from its previous owner with a significant scuff right above the F5-F8 cluster (check timestamp), but it is not visible once keycaps are mounted and viewing the board during normal use. There are no other dings that have occurred while I have owned this board. Brass plate also has some tarnishes due to the age of this board. Otherwise, no blemishes that I could find. Let me know if you don't need switches on this board. The overall price I have for this board is less than what I paid for everything. Feel free to offer, but keep in mind that **the price listed is less than what I paid for everything altogether, and the price has been dropped further.** |  ~~$750 shipped~~ | **SOLD FOR $650 LOCAL MEETUP UNBUILT**
smoke PC TMO50v2 | smoky PC case built with 63.5g Krelbos and C3 stabs on Brass plate. yes, this board ran recently but smoke PC didn't make a return as a color. great board, but honestly it's just been sitting on a shelf for the past few months with little to no use. weight has a few spots of patina/tarnish/whatever you want to call it. comes with Cannonkeys carrying case.Let me know if you don't need switches on this board. If you're compelled to make an offer, feel free to do so. | $600 shipped | yes!
GMK Botanical novelties | bought these through ilumkb extras. they got stuck in Chicago's international sorting center, and by the time they got here, I didn't want them anymore. if you bought botanical r1 on mechmarket and still need novelties, come get them. I don't care if botanical r2 is live, GMK wait times are unbearable until proven otherwise. if you buy one of the keyboards listed above, you might be in for a special treat. | $120 shipped or **FREE WITH PURCHASE OF EITHER KEYBOARD LISTED ABOVE** | yes!
Melodic Confetti r1 blank | by Latrialum. includes auth card. someone else sold this cap for $225 shipped the other day but they deleted their sale prices from their post. | $180 shipped priority mail | yes!
Pink Haze Bukkakey | by Bad n' Booj. **price is below what I paid retail** | $60 shipped | yes!
Pika Lucky Cat | by Ko Caps. sold as FCFS when originally released. | $60 shipped First Class | yes!
Magenta Crayons Eggface v2 | by ETF/Nightcaps. part of the 420 sale this year. **price is below what I paid retail** | $60 shipped First Class | yes
Holo Blesk (B-stock) | by DollarTacos. | ~~$20 shipped First Clas~~ | **SOLD FOR ASKING PRICE**

Priority for responding to offers will be as follows:

 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing all items for asking price (will give discount for purchasing all items listed here because holy moly that means you have money)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing the Aegis for asking price (previous buyer having to back out hurt a bit)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any bundle of either the Aegis or the TMO50v2 + artisan for asking price  (will give discount accordingly)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing the TMO50v2 for asking price
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any bundle of artisans for asking price (will give discount accordingly)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any one item for asking price

Outside of the listed conditions, I'll check based on when you comment **and** PM. The PM is absolutely necessary for the sale of these items. Since I've had this happen before, if there are two people interested in the same item, but one is willing to pay no questions asked while the other has questions or wants to see more pics, I'm 100% selling to the person who will pay no questions asked.

Please understand that if you as a buyer and I agree on a price and you back out of the purchase right after I send the invoice, I will refuse to sell anything to you in the future (yes, that includes if you offer me something like $300 on something that I'm selling for much less). 

 **Do not use the chat function**, I honestly don't know how you are taken to the chat function when the bot's verification post gives you a link to PM sellers. I will ignore you and you won't be in consideration for anything until you send me a PM. I will also ignore you if you do not comment before sending a PM.

If I don't respond, it's likely because I'm just busy doing other things. I will get to all messages accompanying comments in a timely manner. **For the fastest response time, you can add me on Discord through my tag lime#7175**. Thank you for your time."

A little explanation the b key has a little roughing to it on the side (not sure if it shows well but cool picture lol). 

EPBT 9009 - bought from another user basically brand new and used for about two months pretty heavily. No shine but texture has rubbed off a little bit on the gamer keys and common letters. $75 shipped OBO 

KBD75V2 - Tealios and turquoise tealios (Lubed w/ 205g0, tx films, springs 105), genuine GMK screw in stabs (205g0 for housing and stem, clipped, wire dielectric grease) 
$180 shipped OBO 

Now longer explanation for the keyboard:

If you look at the time stamp there are videos. The first one is before they were retuned and second is after. It’s hard to tell the difference but in person it’s night and day. There is definitely a little too much dielectric grease but it does not interfere at all. Also the final picture is just to show the odd layout of switches used. Note gamer keys sound a little different due to being pressed more. I’m just being super transparent since I don’t want people to get something without knowing the history. 

Combined $230 shipped

Forgot to mention I have a bunch of trades on hardware swap if you are interested in if I can be trusted…
Edit two: I’m retuning a couple switches rn to try and even out the difference. Very very light lube job on wasd and e keys should help. I also retuned the ? Key because it seems it was improperly lubed and I never fixed it"

All prices are OBO and include shipping

~~First is the SA Mitolet base. It's on a custom keyboard (not for sale). Used for about a year or so, in pretty good condition. Used for about a year or so. I have the rest of the base kit in a bag, no box available. $90 shipped~~  SOLD

~~Quefrency 65 was built last May 2020 and I used NK blueberries which got lubed prior to install and used the USB-C pro micro (one on each side) . Would love to sell this with the caps. It's the Dev/TTY MT3 caps, my buddy gave them to me a while ago and has a buttload of various extras. He gave me them in a giant bag, so I don't know what kits it has. There's various space bars, icons mods, text mods, green and red accent keys, basically everything. Comes with the TRRS cable as well. $200 for everything, $140 for the board and TRRS, $60 for the caps.~~  SOLD

I have about 95 Boba UT4 switches, lubed enough of them for my 60% with 3202 and the rest are stock. I purchased 100 of them off of r/mm, but broke a few. Will separate them in different baggies as well prior to shipping. $65

1up HSE RGB 60% with Zeal screw ins: this is about 2-2.5 years old, used as a backup keyboard/tester keyboard for new caps and switches. As I'm moving to the new house, I need to trim down some stuff and this isn't making the cut. $60 shipped with stabs

Naga Trinity: Bought it to play WoW with my brother in law, and just didn't get into the game. It does come with the original box and various side button adapter things. Works great, just no use for it."

I'd be willing to part out the keycaps into their individual sets, just ask and I can give you a price, but please don't ask for specific keys. Feel free to PM with any questions, as well as if you'd like to deal locally on any of these items — no lowball offers pls."

1: ~~The board. I bought this board a while back as my first 40% but have decided that the layout isn't for me. It's a prototype prime-e which came with only the red top. I 3d printed a black bottom, but had to split the bottom in half since my printer bed is pretty small. The print is a little uneven between the halves but nothing that's bothered me. I can provide the stl if you want to try a print yourself.~~

~~It's currently built with a hotswap pcb, clipped and lubed screw in cherry stabs, and 67g penguins lubed with 205+105 mix, springs with 105, and filmed with white tx films. (Tactile legs left unlubed). It also comes with 14 spare stock penguins, and 8 lubed which for some reason didn't take well to the lube. I've lubed several hundred switches and never had a switch be so finicky.~~

~~If you want them I can also include enough stock gat milky yellows to cover the board, since I have no other use for them.~~

I'm open to various so let me know what you've got - I'd highly prefer new/unused/BNIB, but would also consider used but unshined for some.

I have a sealed icon mods that I'd be willing to throw in if you have child kits to include, or for higher value GMK sets.
