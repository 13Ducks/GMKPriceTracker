Second owner, originally purchased new for a pretty penny. Culling my collection. Want to get back what I put into it minus some off the top because of me. I opened and used it for about 2 weeks back in March. I think the asdf keys might be getting close to shine soon, if not maybe a tiny bit already? (Left hand homing key habit) I'm not entirely sure. I left some pics of the keys at an angle with natural light to try to gauge it. Otherwise, it's in mint condition.

GMK Shoko Base Kit R1 -- $310 

PP fees on me, and shipping too if it's <$15. I've never shipped caps in trays before, so, y'know.

~~Hello!~~

~~I am selling my KBD75v2 build. It was my main keyboard for about 6 months. Please read entire post before messaging :)~~

* ~~KBD75v2, dark grey aluminum case and aluminum plate (It was supposed to be top dark grey and bottom light grey but both parts looks dark grey to me)~~
* ~~USB Mini-B PCB~~
* ~~Lubed MX Zilents with 205g0 and clear TX switch films (70g springs)~~
* ~~Lubed and clipped GMK Screw-In Stabs with 205g0~~
* ~~Sorbothane foam inside~~
* ~~6ft Coaxius Mini-B straight cable, QDC Aviator, black paracord with clear techflex and grey heatshrink~~
* ~~JTK Hyperfuse keycaps~~

~~The artisans will not be included but can be negotiated. (Dwarf Factory Apollo Moon, Hedwig Keypora)~~

~~Not looking to sell the keycaps separately. The additional JTK Hyperfuse keycaps will be included and shipped in a bag.~~

**~~NOTE~~**~~: The top right screw (behind the escape key if looking from the back of the keyboard) on the back of the keyboard is missing. The person who built this keyboard for me forgot to install it I guess. I messaged KBDFans for a replacement and they asked for just the cost of shipping which was $20 to California. I have a feeling you can just find a replacement screw at a hardware store but I haven't checked. The missing screw does not affect the keyboard performance at all. The only way to notice it is if you pull against the two parts of the case on that corner, the case will wiggle a bit at that corner.~~

~~Looking for $330 shipped CONUS. Will be shipped from California and thoroughly cleaned before shipping.~~ **SOLD for $320**

Hi mm again,

Posting the remainder of the stuff I have for sale. All shipped prices include shipping within continental US only, international and others will have to pay for shipping on top of the price. I can do local pickup at 92880 as well, just message me if you would like to coordinate that. \*keycaps shown on keyboards are not included and sold separately where applicable\*

Hello all, I have reached a temporary endgame due to college, however, due to Gear Acquisition Syndrome, I would like to trade one or both of my Polaris's for other board(s) or Space65. I also have SA bliss and GMK Penumbra (non solarized) that I can also trade for other keycap sets or sweeten the deal.

The specifics of my Polaris' are:

* Rose gold case
* E-white case
* Brass plate w/ original gaskets
* PC half-plate w/ original gaskets
* Aluminum half-plate w/ aftermarket gaskets
* 2 original PCB's (one currently built with lubed and filmed alpacas and PC half plate, I can desolder though. I also have lubed first iteration OG Invyr holy pandas I can include.)
* 2 Case foams
* 1 plate foam.
* Black brass weight
* Gold brass weight
* Stabilizer shims
* 2 extra original gaskets
* 2 aftermarket Poron gasket

I don't know if I'm forgetting anything, but I can update if I am. As of now, priority goes to trades, but later on, I may sell if I see a sweet deal. The Polaris that I want to keep more is the Rose gold one with the black weight because if I can get my hands on Olivia++ extras, but if I can't get my hands on Olivia++ then I will likely sell.

If it is a must buy then price my Polaris at $750 shipped, SA Bliss at $240 shipped, GMK penumbra at $135 shipped, but even then priority goes to trades. Priced like this because I am not looking to sell at this time.

PM so we can discuss details :)","[US-TX] [H] 2 Polaris's, SA Bliss, GMK Penumbra [W] Trades, Space65, Boards, Keycap sets, maybe Paypal"

ABKO K935P | 45g Topre clones, heavily modded. Housing rails and stabs have been lubed with 205g0, and there's a sheet of neoprene foam added underneath the board for better acoustics + grip on the desk. Having used genuine Topre in a HHKB, IMO the clone domes in this board feel like 40g Topre and the board itself is the best sounding keyboard I've ever heard. Super good quiet thock, although there is a bit of audible key wobble. There is a single rubber dome missing, but I have genuine Topre domes (35g, 40g, 45g, 55g, and BKE Lights) I can install anywhere on the board upon request.  [The edges of the board are pretty scuffed due to all the disassembly](https://imgur.com/a/4Q7sYaV), and there are 3 internal screws that snapped off. As far as I can tell the typing sound and feel are unaffected.  | $125

\- [Infinity X GMK 3Run 60% Keyboard.](https://drop.com/buy/infinity-keyboard-kit) This was my first build. Has gateron blues. It's a bit dusty and I definitely made a few mistakes with it, e.g. it's missing a stabilizer on the spacebar. Keyboard only, no cables or extra parts. - **$30 + S&H**

~~- Ergodox EZ, passionately used. Gateron browns, with kickstands. Comes with link cable but no USB (standard micro USB cable). Has a funky assortment of keycaps on it. I don't have any extra keycaps from the set(s) or anything extra with it, but it works just fine. Comes with rubber wrist rests in box. -~~ **~~$60 + S&H~~** SOLD

Freebies/addons:

Just a couple things to avoid adding to the dump. Pay S&H or toss in with another item above.

~~- \~55 Cherry MX Black switches. These were in a 60% I used for gaming and I swapped them out for clears. A few keys didn't made it, so I think there's 55 or so, and I have no idea if any of them were damaged in the removal. They probably work? :shrug:~~ PENDING

~~- Leftover White/Red keycaps from a 104 keycap set I used in a 60% build. Function keys, keys with random faces on them, arrow keys, etc. Never used. I forget what they are, I got them from Aliexpress a few years back.~~ GONE","[US-NH] [H] ErgoDox EZ x 2, 60% build, freebies [W] PayPal"

PM me with your zip code if not local. With USPS being a literal dumpster fire right now I'll have to figure out shipping cost with Fedex or UPS.  Not interested in any trades. If any of my prices seem out of the ballpark let me know and I may adjust them. Feel free to offer a reasonable price.

Every item being sold is either literally new or practically new. The keyboards were typed on once for testing. Keyboards should come with everything they are bundled with, but pictures show what is included (Cables, feet, extra keycaps, etc).  Keycap sets have not been installed unless otherwise stated. Feel free to ask any other questions you may have!

Hi all, 

Up for sale is a 1x sealed GMK Serika. Human fingers have not touched a single key since being packed by the folks at GMK. Bought this many moons ago because I love the cw but I've always been more of a high profile guy so never got around to using it 'til low and behold MT3 Serika came along, so I picked that up instead:)

Hey MM!

Today for sale I have some tangies and some doubleshot PBT keycaps in the  WoB colorway. These come from the same molds and manufacturer as the widely popular NovelKeys BoW and Vaporwave. These are excellent, thick, doubleshot PBT keycaps that have really nice, crisp legends. They also feature [0 warp](https://imgur.com/a/MXUFvRP), unlike a certain GMK WoB keyset. The WoB have the following compatibility, and will include all caps and the keycap puller shown in this pic: [https://imgur.com/a/yNOpYmT](https://imgur.com/a/yNOpYmT)

2) Cherry G80-8000 - £70  
3) XDA Godspeed - MT3 godspeed

Description:  
1) Thought this one would be a fixer-upper but after I gave it a cleanup it was pretty nice! Probably the most solid stock keeb I've tried. As you may expect, the browns aren't the most tactile, but they actually feel pretty smooth and sound quite nice. Here are some sound tests: [with OEM keycaps](https://i.imgur.com/XTEXgUn.mp4) [with GMK keycaps](https://i.imgur.com/gqNuYLp.mp4) [with PBT XDA profile keycaps](https://i.imgur.com/QdDJlqG.mp4).  
There are [DIP switches](https://deskthority.net/wiki/File:Filco_Minila_backplate_1.jpeg) at the back so you can change a few things about the layout. Sadly I only have the OEM keycaps for the layout in the picture.  
I know layout compatibility can be a real issue with Minilas, so if you're planning to use it with Cherry profile keycaps I can include the ePBT 3u spacebars in the timestamp, as well as a 1u R4 Delete key, 2u R4 blanks for left shift. (I might have a couple of other suitable blanks as well like R2 1.5u backspace, let me know if you're interested and I'll rummage.) I'll also include some shorter Costar inserts, as the stock ones can be a fraction too long to fit in shorter keycaps. 

2) Cherry G80-8000LUVGB (ISO-UK layout) [in it's original packaging](https://i.imgur.com/4iRf5HL.jpg). I've only taken it out to check that it's working and to do a [sound test.](https://i.imgur.com/QOLBxLv.mp4) It's dated 2019 and has retooled MX blacks which feel quite smooth. It's PCB mount so if you want you can lube them without desoldering. There's [no wear on the lasered keycaps.](https://i.imgur.com/cNOYzOm.jpg)  

3) Couldn't get used to the XDA profile. Kits are Supernova alphas + Apollo mods + ISO enters. Ideally I'd like to trade for MT3 godspeed solar alphas + UK ISO + paypal, but will also consider a larger bundle (as long as it contains those two kits).   

Prices include paypal fees but not shipping*. Also feel free to offer me trades, especially for interesting kits or keycap sets!

V4N4G0N prototype. Its a plastic case white with Tangerine switches with Cherry MX white stems and a purple C3 stab. Comes with no keycaps. The mounting style is the plate has several different litle pads that sit on rubber buttons on top and bottom making it somewhat of a gasket mount. I Keyboard is a very cool design because it has the 1-6 num row. Im only selling this one because i have a custom made acrylic gasket mount one.

~~**YOK Mint Pandas:** 90x count. Obtained from the extras sale from Bolsa Supply. These are the lubed ones, which I opened 10 of them to find that only the slider rails have been lubed. It was mostly a very small amount of lube applied, so you could just paint over it or spread it out easily. **Looking for $70 shipped**~~ **SOLD**

~~**Holy Mint Pandas:** 86 count + 1 YOK mint switch. These are holy pandas made with halo true stems and mint pandas from the very first round of mint pandas from over a year ago. Not sure if it's because of this round, or opening and closing them a bunch of times, but the tactility of these is a bit weaker than the average holy panda. I've wiped the lube off the sliders since I felt like I overlubed them, though some lube may still be on there. Sliders rails have been lubed with Tribosys 3203, and are installed with 62g TX springs, oiled with victorinox oil. **Looking for $94 shipped**~~ **SOLD**

~~**Sprit 63.5 Slow Springs:** 100 count. Have been lightly oiled victorinox oil if that matters to you. **Looking for $19 shipped**~~ **SOLD**

If anyone is interested in all of what I have here, I would either bundle or trade for a GMK set of keycaps in pretty much any condition. If you buy and Paypal before 4 pm, I'll do my best to ship out today. Thanks!","[US-NY] [H] Kalih Box White, White USB-C Aviator Cable, Drop Holy Panda, Drop Sunrise Keycaps [W] Paypal, GMK"

Hi all, just joined the community recently and bought a lot of stuff. Many hours of contemplating later, these didn't end up making the cut since I have some more interesting things down the pipe. 

Buyer will pay for shipping, please note that prices are without shipping - shipping will vary based on location. Prefer to ship to CONUS, will most likely be using USPS priority, I have over 100 confirmed trades on HWS. 

Items for sale:

* **Unbuilt KBD67v2 MKII DIY hotswap kit in Gray:** $365 - comes with PCB & case foam. PCB was tested to ensure functionality. Can include new durock screw in stabs for or a full sized (104) set of GMK screw in stabs (7x 2U, 1x 6.25/7U) for $20 extra.

* **Durock Linears 67g x70 lubed w/ Krytox 205g0:** $75, these have not been used/soldered.

* **Drop (stock) v2 Holy Pandas x110:** $130, unused/never soldered. These will be shipped in a bag as the trays are too awkward to fit into a small flat rate box. If you want the trays, shipping will be additional (original Drop box not included).

If interested, I can also bundle multiple items to save on shipping. Please comment before PMing. 

Thanks,

Hello weary traveler, perhaps I might interest you in some items...

**Mecha-01 USB-C Aviator Cable**: [PIC](https://imgur.com/a/KIF3Tag) Black 5-pin aviator connector with purple techflex over neon green paracord, green and orange heatshrink. Made with the GMK Mecha-01 and other EVA-inspired colorways in mind. Brand new and unused, handmade by yours truly. Asking $65 shipped.

**~~Prime\_E~~**~~: Built with lubed milky top gat yellows in a WorldspawnsKeebs stacked frosted acrylic case. I tried tinting the acrylic sheets with dye and ended up with a very subtle coke-bottle green which I personally really like. (~~[~~Tried to get a good pic of the tint.~~](https://imgur.com/a/T1daeYO)~~) Got this board off /mm and have loved using it, I just ended up getting another Prime\_E recently. Will include extra black and red hardware screws. Asking $110 shipped.~~ **SOLD**

**~~Varmilo VA87~~**~~: customized and purchased directly from the company. It has a white case with orange backlighting, Zealios 67g on the alphas, Kailh box whites on the mods and a couple of box jades on the esc and enter keys. Very solid board and kept in excellent condition, I simply don't use it anymore. I realize it's a fairly particular keyboard as far as the details go, but maybe someone out there would be interested. Will include the PBT keycap set that came with it, which was also customized. Comes with clear Varmilo USB-mini cable and shipped in original packaging. (~~[~~Pics of keycaps and backlighting~~](https://imgur.com/a/33YqFeJ)~~) Asking $100 + shipping.~~ **SOLD**

[Black Fallacy](https://imgur.com/a/UzEkFoS)

Black ano, untreated brass weight (what was offered), some specs in ano but nothing horrendous. No dings or dents.

Comes with two prototype PCBS in black, these are both VIA compatible, but do not have in switch LED support. They also have flex cuts for what it's worth.

Comes with a full CF plate from PKB and a half FR4 plate from Hiney that I cut myself. Does not come built.

[Audio demonstration](https://youtu.be/p1Vk3fv_MPc) from Koen

*Price:* $1200 + shipping or Trades. Prefer to local to Austin, TX. I can drive far as well. 

Big on boards like HBCP or a variety of TKLs. Also a big fan of OG Cherry, GMK, BSP, IMSTO, and CRP.

**Discipline 65:**  
**$250 Shipped SOLD**

Bought from another /mm user a couple months ago. Built with lubed NK Creams (205) and modded GMK screw in stabs. Acrylic case built with 4 black layers, 2 clear layers and POM plate. Pom plate height leaves small gap in layers so case is not completely flush but does not impact typing experience. I have included a picture of the gapping in timestamp album and can provide additional photos if needed. Does not come with bottom Discipline plate so this cannot be turned into caseless Discipline.

Hey Everyone,

Preface: I know that most of the stuff in this post wont be super valuable so if you're an enthusiast there is probably not much here for you. I am hoping that this post help people new to the hobby build up a small collection without breaking the bank.

There are a few higher end items but those will be at the bottom of this post. And of course all prices are negotiable and I'm open to trades if you have something to offer of equal value (even outside of keyboards).

\-Anyways, here is what I have for you today-Bundle stuff:

[~~Logitech G710 w/ XDA Moonlanding~~](https://imgur.com/a/4tBCdpM) ~~- A truly sentimental product for me. It was my first mechanical keyboard I ever owned and my daily driver for 5 years. I was actually intending to gift it to my younger brother before he decided that he enjoyed the feeling of an official Apple Keyboard (we all have our preferences right?). It has definitely seen better days: the original keys became highly faded after those years of use and the clip holding the included wrist wrest broke. Because of all of that, i felt i should try to combo this keyboard with a a brand new but very affordable set i purchased form Aliexpress (or ebay cant remember). Price: $50 (shipping included)~~ Removed because someone made offer on keys.

~~Dont want the keyboard?~~

~~XDA Moonlanding Keys Price: $25 (shipping included)~~  SOLD to u/CeaserPleaser for $20 bundle discount

[Pok3r MX Blue Version w/ OEM Carbon Keycaps and Keyluminati Maximus](https://imgur.com/a/TuYXOAL) \- So many first on this one for me. It was my true affordable endgame. A sold feeling board with my favorite switches at the time, some solidly made keycaps that made a loud clack when they bottomed out (if you dont know by now, i loved making as much noise as possible as i type), and a beautiful artisan to tie it all together. I figure the Keycap on its own is worth a decent chunk of money but i still love how this all came together. The break down is: $75 for the Keyluminati, $25 for the carbon keys, and $65 for the pok3r. $150 total

I am willing to split the above if you dont want the board, or if they Keyluminati/Carbon keys are too much of a premium I have the [stock pok3r keycaps and accents](https://imgur.com/a/JQmF4FY) i can throw on the poker without increasing the price.

Keycaps:

[~~Black OEM Pudding Keycaps~~](https://imgur.com/a/SmlTX95)~~: 110 Key Set with some ISO keys but no support for u7 space keyboards. Im pretty sure they are brand new but ill cut 5 dollars off the price since I cant remember. Price: $20 (shipping included)~~ PENDING

[~~White OEM Pudding Keycaps~~](https://imgur.com/a/p1vBY4w): ~~Same as above but in White. Price: $20 (shipping included).~~ (Sold to u/aznblahboy for $20)

Switches:

[MX Browns](https://imgur.com/a/vnrSOqp): 59 Stock browns with low use. I cant find the last 2 to make a complete 60 set. So if you need it, i can throw in 2 Tealios to fill the gap. $25 (shipping included)

[MX Blue](https://imgur.com/a/vnrSOqp): 61 Stock blues with low use. Note: one of the blues has some lube discoloring on the case, and it clicks slightly differently from the others (pics in album). So I can throw a Tealios or Zealios to make it up but sadly neither of the replacements have the audible click... sorry. $25 (shipping included)

Artisans:

[~~Roxanakey Fuku Owl~~](https://imgur.com/a/GjSbCbu) ~~- Cast bronze key that has a beautiful weight and gem eyes that shine beautifully through. Price $25 (shipping included)~~ SOLD to u/Lawman1999 for $20 bundle discount

Higher end stuff:

[~~GMK Eclipse Base with Novelties and Blue Rathcaps Poliwrath~~](https://imgur.com/a/ZrrxJys)~~: This combo is really in a league of its own. I planned on building a nice dark black and blue on a 65% with the polywrath taking the side function keys but lately ive been slowly falling out of the hobby, so i should offer this up to someone who can make that dream a reality. I assume the Poliwrath is about $110, novelties $25, and base eclipse at $175. Base is open and used maybe 2 times before staying in the box for months. Not separating and not including eclipse box/tray unless you pay the extra shipping cost. Price: $310 (no box and tray), $325 (w/ tray)~~  SOLD to u/teamasterdong for $310

[~~GMK Vaporwave ISO Kit~~](https://imgur.com/a/P5AOXwI)~~: Brand New. I bought everything for vaporware including ISO because i thought id want big enter.... but I'm okay being a pleb with the normal one. Price $25 (however since I'm in the US and someone outside of the US will probably want this... shipping is sadly not included).~~ SOLD to u/Lawman1999 for $25 

[~~Rathcaps Poliwrath Bronze~~](https://imgur.com/a/aoA1a9s)~~: These are some heavy boys. They are made with a metal infused resin. I was hoping they would be a little more shiny than they came out since i wanna make a gold themed board. Price $110 (shipped).~~ Sold to u/spyderrz for $110 plus international shipping cost

[NZ Rex Bronze](https://imgur.com/a/r0zHQLK): Another Heavy boy. Very beautiful cap i ended up not having a place for. Price: $65 (shipped)

This is a black Realforce R2 TKL with variable weight domes and Hangul sub-legend caps from a very old Realforce 86uk.

Hey /mm, been away for a bit so this post will be relatively simple. I'm looking to trade for my [Wishlist Keyporas](https://imgur.com/uEDESTZ) and maybe some other Keyporas or rare artisans.

Some of the things on offer are not 1:1 for the wishlist Keyporas for obvious reasons. I'll also be holding out for my bigger priorities with some of these items, so apologies but this won't be FCFS.

Hey MM!

Today for sale I have some tangies and some matrix FFF switches. Both are extremely smooth, and manufactured by JWK. I also have some doubleshot PBT keycaps in the  WoB colorway. These come from the same molds and manufacturer as the widely popular NovelKeys BoW and Vaporwave. These are excellent, thick, doubleshot PBT keycaps that have really nice, crisp legends. They also feature [0 warp](https://imgur.com/a/MXUFvRP), unlike a certain GMK WoB keyset. The WoB have the following compatibility, and will include all caps and the keycap puller shown in this pic: [https://imgur.com/a/yNOpYmT](https://imgur.com/a/yNOpYmT)

Note: These are not keycaps from Novelkeys, but are from the same molds and same factory and are the same quality.

Got to make room for future projects, so letting go of a couple of great starter keebs today.  
1) Anne Pro 2 - £55  
2) Filco Minila Air - £60  
3) Cherry G80-8000 - £70  
4) XDA Godspeed - MT3 godspeed

Description:  
1) Box reds, here's a [sound test](https://i.imgur.com/E4wlFq2.mp4). Was rescued from a bad soldering job, so has 3 jumper wires but is fully functional. Comes with the original cable and RGB accent kit. There's very little wear on the stock keycaps.   
  
2) Thought this one would be a fixer-upper but after I gave it a cleanup it was pretty nice! Probably the most solid stock keeb I've tried. As you may expect, the browns aren't the most tactile, but they actually feel pretty smooth and sound quite nice. Here are some sound tests: [with OEM keycaps](https://i.imgur.com/XTEXgUn.mp4) [with GMK keycaps](https://i.imgur.com/gqNuYLp.mp4) [with PBT XDA profile keycaps](https://i.imgur.com/QdDJlqG.mp4).  
There are [DIP switches](https://deskthority.net/wiki/File:Filco_Minila_backplate_1.jpeg) at the back so you can change a few things about the layout. Sadly I only have the OEM keycaps for the layout in the picture.  
I know layout compatibility can be a real issue with Minilas, so if you're planning to use it with Cherry profile keycaps I can include the ePBT 3u spacebars in the timestamp, as well as a 1u R4 Delete key, 2u R4 blanks for left shift. (I might have a couple of other suitable blanks as well like R2 1.5u backspace, let me know if you're interested and I'll rummage.) I'll also include some shorter Costar inserts, as the stock ones can be a fraction too long to fit in shorter keycaps. 

3) Cherry G80-8000LUVGB (ISO-UK layout) [in it's original packaging](https://i.imgur.com/4iRf5HL.jpg). I've only taken it out to check that it's working and to do a [sound test.](https://i.imgur.com/QOLBxLv.mp4) It's dated 2019 and has retooled MX blacks which feel quite smooth. It's PCB mount so if you want you can lube them without desoldering. There's [no wear on the lasered keycaps.](https://i.imgur.com/cNOYzOm.jpg)  

4) Couldn't get used to the XDA profile. Kits are Supernova alphas + Apollo mods + ISO enters. Ideally I'd like to trade for MT3 godspeed solar alphas + UK ISO + paypal, but will also consider a larger bundle (as long as it contains those two kits).   

Prices include paypal fees but not shipping*. Also feel free to offer me trades, especially for interesting kits or keycap sets!

Board | Description | Price		
-----|-----------|-----		
[Rose Gold Tofu Build](https://i.imgur.com/dGPPaov.jpg) | Built with mint Holy Pandas lubed with 3203 (+ a single red HP on left shift), lubed + band aided pink Durock stabs. KBD6X hotswap PCB (tsangan layout, the left shift is a little weird with HPs. Just reseat the switch if it's not registering) with a universal brass plate and neoprene foam on the bottom for improved acoustics and grip on the desk. Comes with the full EPBT Valentine base kit. The board itself is in great condition, barely any marks on it except for a small machining mark on the right side. Extra HPs are included (approximately 65 total?), but I am not the original owner of these and did not lube them myself.  | $300		
ABKO K935P | 45g Topre clones, heavily modded. Housing rails and stabs have been lubed with 205g0, and there's a sheet of neoprene foam added underneath the board for better acoustics + grip on the desk. Having used genuine Topre in a HHKB, IMO the clone domes in this board feel like 40g Topre and the board itself is the best sounding keyboard I've ever heard. Super good quiet thock, although there is a bit of audible key wobble. There is a 40g Topre dome installed in the top right corner. If wanted, I can include genuine Topre domes of all weights (35g, 40g, 45g, 55g) and a BKE Light if you want to test Topre weightings/domes out. [The edges of the board are pretty scuffed due to all the disassembly](https://imgur.com/a/4Q7sYaV), and there are 3 internal screws that snapped off. As far as I can tell the typing sound and feel are unaffected.  | $150		
IBM Model M | 1391401 model, fully functional with a detachable coiled PS/2 cable. Missing a single keycap on the numpad, but otherwise in great condition and personally cleaned.  | $70

Being a teacher has more out of pocket expenses than I expected, so have to let go of my Unikorn :(

The keyboard is gasket mounted and does not include any screws for a tray mount. Built with lubed yok red pandas. Brass weight has patina as shown. Only flaw on the board is the slight ano flaw, which is shown in the album. Uses mini-USB and can include a basic coiled USB-A to mini-USB cable if needed.

The Noah is built with c3 Tangerines v2 lubed with 205g0 and spring swapped with 60g Slow Sprit Springs lubed with 105. The shift and enter stabilizers are from everglade and the spacebar is GMK with c3 stab stems. The PCB has RGB and plate is aluminum.

Hi mm,

Have some stuff for sale. Will have a lot of stuff coming from GBs over the next 6 months to a year, so decided to try out minimalism and see how life is just having two boards. Realize I have too much ""stuff"", and some stuff just gotta go. Attempting to make my own keyboard soon; between making prototypes and life I think I should free up some stuff I don't use.

Most of these boards/keysets have been used for less than a day or two and just have been serving their purpose looking pretty on a desk top or display case. Some keysets on the boards in the timestamp are not for sale, namely GMK DMG and GMK Olive. Anything in pictures not listed is not for sale.

Prices include shipping within CONUS only. I'm willing to ship international but you will have to take responsibility both financially and literally. Priority goes to local (92880) and CONUS. Local buyers message me for discount and pickup arrangement.

I will entertain interesting trades, but unless you have something along the lines of a 1/65 I will prefer Paypal. Not expecting that of course, but still **NO KBDFANS** boards please. Once invoice is sent please pay in a timely manner to keep things moving, if no payment within 3 hours, I will move on to the next buyer.

Note: **NO CHATS** plz, I will just ignore. If you're on mobile, just scroll down to the mechbot message to PM me. Feel free to ask me any questions.

Also, keycaps **DO NOT** come with keyboards as shown in photos, they will be sold separately. Thanks\~

Hi all, selling a few things from the collection. Would prefer to ship within Australia but let me know if you're elsewhere and willing to pay for postage. Can also do organise pickup Brisbane Northside. Negotiable on prices mainly if combining, prices USD excluding postage. Everything is lightly used but still essentially new condition.

Plum96 - This is a PCB mount board, and I have replaced the standard Cherry black stems with Gateron Green stems and 80g springs for nice heavy clicks. Comes with the standard keycaps as seen [here](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/images/products/large_1194_MD-5474_20150120144944_cfc5e8576be07937.jpg). $120

Vortex Core - With MX Clears. $70

Miuni32 with Jolimon case and Box Jades that have been cruciformed with the tool to fix the size. Fun board, if you can handle layers it's perfectly useable. $80.

Ducky Doubleshot white shine thru keycap set - quality Ducky. $20

EK Mechlube 2 - great for use on stabs, can also be used on switches as a thicker lube. $5 each

Doubleshot PBT/POM green keycaps. $8

Black clear ABS keycaps - totally shine thru, great for looking at RGB! $20

Grab bag caps - hundreds of caps in each bag, sorted out so you can pick and choose.

[Timestamp](https://imgur.com/gallery/6qdOBvh)

First of all, I want to clarify that this is my first time selling stuff on this subreddit, please do let me know if I am not doing this right. Appreciate all feedback!

Having started this hobby almost 2 years ago (I know I am new compared to most of you guys), there are quite a bit of stuff accumulated over time which I have barely used (if at all). So I thought might as well give it a try here to recover some of the original costs.

I am located in Melbourne but I can ship internationally so all offers are welcome. All prices below exclude shipping fee.

Letting this one go as the polycarb version is on the way. Condition is excellent as can be seen in the picture. It comes with the original packaging and accessories.~~|~~USD$450 or AUD$620 SOLD~~|

|~~Drop Ctrl Kaihua Box White -~~ [~~picture~~](https://imgur.com/gallery/k5mBkyE)|~~Bought this only very early into this hobby. Didn't like clicky switches I went back to the Drop Alt which had tactiles. Condition is almost brand new. It will come with the original packaging and accessories.~~|~~USD$150 or AUD$207 SOLD~~|
|~~Drop Alt Cherry Brown -~~ [~~picture~~](https://imgur.com/gallery/6eA5vV4)|~~My first purchase. I did play around with it unlike the other items I am selling. Foamed the interior and also lubed the stabs to try to make it sound nicer. The condition is still very good. It will come with the original packaging and accessories.~~|~~USD$100 or AUD$138 SOLD~~|
|~~SA Orange Dolch (Alpha + Spacebar + Modifier + Alt Color) -~~ [~~picture~~](https://imgur.com/gallery/EBwPgki)|~~My first SA set. The colour doesn't really match any of the kits I current have. Only used a couple of times. Condition is excellent.~~|~~USD$50 or AUD$69~~|
|~~NK Blueberry - quantity: 69 -~~ [~~picture~~](https://imgur.com/gallery/3KbT6zY)|~~Was trying to explore more options in tactiles. Originally purchased 70, used 1 in trying to do a frankenstein switch but failed, hence 69 left. Brand new, never used in any build at all.~~|~~USD$40 or AUD$55 SOLD~~|
|~~Cherry Retooled Blacks - with 67g Durock springs and lubed with 205g0 -~~ [~~picture~~](https://imgur.com/gallery/Y0xGSzT)|~~Spring swapped with Durock 67g as the original weight was a bit too much for me. They will come with the original spring as well. Purchased these to compare with H1s, ended up sticking with the H1 and hence these are here for sale.~~|~~USD$40 or AUD$55 SOLD~~|

Almost all prices above are at or below the original purchase price even including the GMK set (if I count the original shipping cost). But please do let me know if you feel the pricing is wrong, I am open to reasonable negotiations.

If you question the condition of any items that you are interested in, please let me know and I am more than happy to take more pictures to address your concern.

Please reply to this post before PM.

[Timestamps](https://imgur.com/gallery/38RHwqu)

I am selling two boards I've built specifically to sell (to customers in EU).

**60%:**

The low profile 60% board is also available prebuilt directly from KBDfans. The difference with this one is, that it has lubed (thick silicone grease on the wires and 205g0 on the clipped stems) cherry stabs and handlubed gateron yellows (205g0). It also comes in ISO, which is not available from KBDfans. The Keycaps are white thick PBT blanks. The plate is polycarbonate, making this board even lighter.

I used this keyboard for for a week, since I loved the deep sound it makes so much. I will bring it to the post office, as soon as payment arrives.

***Asking 170€*** including shipping,

Which is roughly what I paid for it.

[More Pics of the 60% board and a sound test](https://imgur.com/a/TM9T6uu) (iPhone 8 camera and microphone, sounds great in person)

**~~Tofu65:~~**

This is a black Tofu65 with alu plate, screw in cherry stabs (lubed wires with silicone grease and 205g0 on the clipped stems), Gateron milky black switches (hand lubed with 205g0) and a set of ISO-DE GmK White on Black Keycaps from CandyKeys. The case is modded with custom foam aswell.

The plate is painted with Edding matte acrylic paint, since the silver aluminium would be visible and distracting from the otherwise blacked out look. This has another advantage of changing the sound profile, by dampening the ping you might be used to hearing from metal plates.

[Plate](https://imgur.com/a/yFtOM2U/)

[More Pics of the Tofu and a sound test](https://imgur.com/a/a6xffX2) (iPhone 8 camera and microphone, sounds great in person)

***Asking 340€*** including shipping, ***~~240€~~*** ~~without the keycaps~~  Sold for 240€

* Really nice hotswap board. Incredibly solid, weighty feel.
* Brass standoffs installed; aluminum (silver) set included as well.

* Stabs included (I think they're GMK, don't totally remember. Will remove if you'd prefer)
* Custom ash wrist wrest with felt bottom included free--can leave out if desired. It's somewhat tall and you might find with works better with high profile keysets such as SA or MT3.

Hey MM!

Today for sale I have some tangies and some matrix FFF switches. Both are extremely smooth, and manufactured by JWK. I also have some doubleshot PBT keycaps, in the BoW and WoB colorways. These come from the same molds and manufacturer as the widely popular NovelKeys BoW and Vaporwave. These keycaps are not from novelkeys however, but they come from the same factory and are the same quality. These are excellent, thick, doubleshot PBT keycaps that have really nice, crisp legends. They also feature [0 warp](https://imgur.com/a/MXUFvRP), unlike a certain GMK WoB keyset. Both the BoW and WoB have the following compatibility, and will include all caps and the keycap puller shown in this pic: [https://imgur.com/a/yNOpYmT](https://imgur.com/a/yNOpYmT)

Note: These are not keycaps from Novelkeys, but are from the same molds and same factory and are the same quality.

Got to make room for future projects, so letting go of a couple of great starter keebs today.  
1) Anne Pro 2 - £60  
2) Filco Minila Air - £65  
3) Cherry G80-8000 - £75  
4) XDA Godspeed - MT3 godspeed

Description:  
1) Box reds, here's a [sound test](https://i.imgur.com/E4wlFq2.mp4). Comes with the original cable and RGB accent kit. Was rescued from a bad soldering job, so has 3 jumper wires but is fully functional.  
  
2) Thought this one would be a fixer-upper but after I gave it a cleanup it was pretty nice! Probably the most solid stock keeb I've tried. As you may expect, the browns aren't the most tactile, but they actually feel pretty smooth and sound quite nice. Here are some sound tests: [with OEM keycaps](https://i.imgur.com/XTEXgUn.mp4) [with GMK keycaps](https://i.imgur.com/gqNuYLp.mp4) [with PBT XDA profile keycaps](https://i.imgur.com/QdDJlqG.mp4).  
There are [DIP switches](https://deskthority.net/wiki/File:Filco_Minila_backplate_1.jpeg) at the back so you can change a few things about the layout. Sadly I only have the OEM keycaps for the layout in the picture.  
I know layout compatibility can be a real issue with Minilas, so if you're planning to use it with Cherry profile keycaps I can include the ePBT 3u spacebars in the timestamp, as well as a 1u R4 Delete key, 2u R4 blanks for left shift. (I might have a couple of other suitable blanks as well like R2 1.5u backspace, let me know if you're interested and I'll rummage.) I'll also include some shorter Costar inserts, as the stock ones can be a fraction too long to fit in shorter keycaps. 

3) Cherry G80-8000LUVGB (ISO-UK layout) [in it's original packaging](https://i.imgur.com/4iRf5HL.jpg). I've only taken it out to check that it's working and to do a [sound test.](https://i.imgur.com/QOLBxLv.mp4) It's dated 2019 and has retooled MX blacks which feel quite smooth. It's PCB mount so if you want you can lube them without desoldering. There's [no wear on the lasered keycaps.](https://i.imgur.com/cNOYzOm.jpg)  

4) Couldn't get used to the XDA profile. Kits are Supernova alphas + Apollo mods + ISO enters. Ideally I'd like to trade for MT3 godspeed solar alphas + UK ISO + paypal, but will also consider a larger bundle (as long as it contains those two kits).   

Prices include paypal fees but not shipping*. Also feel free to offer me trades, especially for interesting kits or keycap sets!

* Only shipping CONUS for now.
* Pm first.

Good morning, afternoon, or night MM!

Have a couple of items for sale:

~~*Black Mysterium v1 - ~~
Plate: Black FR4 | Stabs: Lubed C3 Equalz screw-in | Switches: Everglide Oreos (tactile) | Keycaps: None

This is a black Mysterium kit from CTFKB's first run, built with factory-lubed Everglide Oreos and C3 Equalz tuned stabs. Build includes FR4 plate and dampening foam, which help to produce a nice, deep sound signature. Installed black aluminum feet, which help achieve a nice typing angle. Purchased from another Redditor and didn't love it as much as I expected. **$160+Shipping**

Please note that one screw on the bottom is not properly secured. I believe the standoff above it actually came loose, but should be fixable by removing the bottom and foam layers. However, I cannot guarantee this. As-is, the screw does not affect the sound or feel of the typing experience and is only noticeable when the board is flipped upside down.



~~GMK Nines :~~

~~Received sealed, used for less than a week. Unfortunately I don't have a good board to do this keycap set justice, and having been eyeing up more colorful keycap sets. Will be shipped in box, which has slight damage (pictured) **$270+Shipping**~~



* Black USB-C/USB-C cable:

Pretty straightfoward. 6in coil, 4ft total . hasnt retained springiness as well as I'd like. USB-C to USB-C, not good for RGB boards. **$30+shipping**



* Grey USB-C/USB-C Cable:

Another straightforward one. Aviator connector on this one. Also not good for RGB Boards 3.5in coil. 3.5 ft total **$45+shipping**

Some of my wants:
GMK Delta, Future Funk 2020 Anime girl desk mat (If anyone knows if these have shipped, or if the extras have already been sold, please let me know), GMK Camping (base+novelties or just base), POM Jelly Caps (prefer rainbow), Everglide Oreo switches. Open to taking a look at any other interesting keycap sets (No epbt sushi or GOK x epbt). And of course, cash.

Not FCFS. Prioritizing people I've dealt with prior and good reputations, comment before PMing, please lordy no chats.

~~**Noxary x75 - $500** ~~ **PENDING**

[Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/aGeg8go), has super old timestamps in there, just ask for more pics.

This board is a 1/1 prototype for a board that never went into GB. There are some marks on the board, it came like that from the factory. Comes with:

* Build 1: Fixed ISO Copper Plate with Zealstotles, Lubed, stickerd and sprit spring swapped. Some switches are inconsistent so will include 12 more switches + ~ 15 stems + ~15 stickers.

* Build 2: Fixed ISO Copper Plate with lubed and spring swapped retooled blacks, they're nice and smooth.

* Fixed ANSI Alu plate. Don't have a pcb to go with this plate but it's compatible with a kbd75 pcb so easy to get another.

* 2 tops: 1 x WLK, 1 x WK

Plates are pretty patinated now so could use a clean if you don't like that sort of thing. Also missing a few screws but don't know the sizes.

**GMK Hydro (Base, Novs, Space) - $350 ($275 if bundled with a board)**

Sets pretty shiny now as i've had it for quite some time, but shiny gmk is better anyway ;) see timestamp for pics.

~~**Noxary 268 AG - $400 Built, $350unbuilt**~~ **SOLD**

[Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/qkJrlsZ), has old timestamps in there, just ask for more pics. GMK MUTED ISN'T FOR SALE.

Board can come built with lubed and spring swapped Zealios V2s or will be desoldered and sold as a kit. Comes with a spare weight that has incorrect tolrances and would need dremeling. Has a Brass plate, could also use a polish. Supports ISO & ANSI.

~~**GMK Soware - $150 ($100 if bundled with a board)**~~ **PENDING**
Sets pretty shiny now as i've had it for quite some time, but shiny gmk is better anyway ;) see timestamp for pics. Also see x75 pics to see it on a board.

~~SPRING BUNDLE: 70x Gateron Yellow Springs + 30-40x Sprit 60 Slow Springs = 100 Springs+~~|~~**THESE ARE SPRINGS NOT SWITCHES** Though about selling just the Gateron Yellow springs at first but I'll throw in something a bit extra. These are both slow rated springs. Though personally I think the yellow's springs are a tad heavier than Sprit's 60 slows. Mix and match maybe? Keep them as backups? Or interestingly: make slightly lighter slow curved switches for your mods and outerbound keys? It's your choice what to do with them **Lubrication information:** Gateron Yellows springs are Lubed with GPL-107 Oil, Sprit 60 Slows are left stock and unused.~~|~~$17 Shipped to CON-US~~ **SOLD to /u/kimchijodyboi** |~~$15 + Shipping Internationally.~~

Hey mm, got smore stuff here, and stuff I wanna get my hands on :)



HAVE



Doro67 Titanium Gray built with creams ss, lubed, filmed.
Like this little board a lot, it's gorgeous. If it doesn't go today, going to be keeping it. In perfect condition, no pcb or daughterboard issues, does need some quality sound dampening foam to help with reverb but it is THOCKY with that thicc plate. Looking mostly to trade up to a polaris, key65, whatever, something gasket mounted.

Would sell for $500 shipped.


GMK 8008s

Honestly don't have a board to put these on and, don't hate me, but not a huge fan of cherry profile... I like my tall caps... Barely used, no shine or wear, will ship in bags for $280. Would also trade for mt3 Serika, or Susuwatari. SOLD FOR ASKING



WANT



TKL pcb plz h87, leeku, whatever dont care as long as it works please hook me up :( 


Caps mentioned above, serika and susuwatari mt3s. Also looking for pom/jelly caps if anyones got em.


Space themed deskmats, preferably godspeed, nasa WoB, anything spacey ooooo

All prices are shipped to EU destinations. 

GMK WoB Hiragana. Never mounted. In bags. 
190 GBP Sold

MT3 Serika Katakana alphas + Mods
175 GBP - available

Deskeys switch film. Unused. 
15 GBP Sold

Alpacas. Stock and unused. 180x
Asking 0.8 GBP/ea. Sold x180

Black Ink v2s. 100x. Stock and unused. 
90 GBP. Sold 10x

Have some extra POM plates for the kbd67v2 mkii. Plate doesn't have cut off for standoffs and is made using the files for the solderable PCB. That said you can use it for the hotswap variant as well but it's easier to do with setting up the plate/switches/keycap assembly completely and then mounting it on the board. 
Asking 35 GBP. 

Also have an original brass kbd67v2 mkii hotswap plate from KBDFans. 
Asking 50 GBP. 

Finally.. ordered way too much of an acoustic sound dampening material. It's 2mm thick, should fit a few cases. It's graded to isolate 26dB with a single layer. It's quite dense and will legitimately add weight to your build as it's reasonably heavy for its size. From a local sound specialist. 

Let me know if there's interest and what size you want for pricing. A rough 60 percent cut out for about 25 GBP shipped. 

For anyone willing to do a bank transfer. Can give a discount on price.","[EU-UK] [H] GMK WoB Hiragana, MT3 Serika, Black Ink v2 + Alpaca switches, Deskeys films, Mill-Max 7305, KBD67 V2 mkii POM + brass plates, Sound dampening material [W] PayPal"

Hi friends,

I've got a polycarb prime\_elise for sale/trade this time. 

First, let me say, I love this layout. I tried polycarb because some people in the community swear by it, and I had to do it once. Turns out, I prefer my boards as heavy as bricks, so I traded around a bit until I could get my hands on an aluminum case. 

So, you're getting the brand new pcb (I can include either solder or hotswap, your preference) and brass plate, with a very very lightly used case. There's not a ding or scratch or a mark anywhere, but the led isolator (sp?) is installed already.

The Base kit is used but in good condition (see additional pictures). No shine or scratches, comes in original packaging.

All other kits are unused and still sealed.

I would like to sell all kits together for 350€ + shipping.

If you are just interested in one of those kits please make an offer (without shipping costs), I might split them if I find someone for the other kits.

If you are outside of the EU please keep in mind that shipping right now is quite expensive (US is like 65€) because DHL is doing premium only for most countries.

Fair warning: this board is very used. Previously desoldered and resoldered (one time) - currently equipped with Kailh box pale blues. I ran into issues while desoldering, so the PCB is fairly ""worn"" but everything works fine. I don't recommend trying to desolder the switches, so this would be a good board for someone that likes pale blues. The acrylic diffuser cracked in the top left corner, so I glued it back - this doesn't affect the RGB diffusion and you cannot see it while the board is put together. There are a few tiny nicks in the paint around the inside edges at the bottom of the board that you can see in the photos.  | $100

Please let me know if the prices appear out of line; I am open to offers below asking price if that is the case. Happy to discount for a bundle as well if you are somehow looking for both of these boards.

I did not keep the original packaging for either boards, so they will be shipped in a Cannonkeys sleeve and with ample amounts of bubble wrap. Prefer CONUS at this time but will consider international shipping if you are willing to pay for it.

Hey guys, 

Still trying to slim down the collection here...

Listed prices include Paypal fees and USPS First Class shipping. **Feel free to OBO (can only offer me less than asking!) on stuff but will give priority to trades, bundles, and my listed price.** Not entirely FCFS either as I might give priority to people who've been searching for things specifically.

SP SA Pulse | Noire, Rams, and 7u Spacebars kits. Doesn't have noticeable shine but some caps do have small scratches and one has dents on the side (see pictures). Not that noticeable imo and tend to come that way since SP ships in bags. Highly prefer to bundle as its a complete set this way. | ~~Trades or $150~~ **Sold**

Selling this Matrix Noah that I acquired off MM. Price reflects what I have invested into it.

1\] Dark Green Matrix Noah - $ 700 shipped CONUS OBO

\- Built with Honeywell T1s lubed by Classy (man does a fantastic job)

\- Top green matches well with Wasabi as shown in pictures. Alternatively, bottom grey matches will with oblivion.

\- Flawless condition. Comes with extra aluminium plate / PCB / daughterboard.

\- Indicator lights and per key RGB all confirmed working. Programmable via QMK.

\- Comes in the Matrix box and with all related accessories. Please note that this is the China GB version with square indicator lights on the top instead of the strip that the western GB had.

\- Finally, comes with an internal weight that no. 23 ran. It has been firmly placed inside the case using double sided tape and provides good weight to the board. Also lined with shelf liner inside for the extra thock.

\- Keycaps not included. GMK Wasabi (complete base kit) can be added to the bundle for $180 if needed. Not willing to sell separately.

\- Keyboard can be desoldered upon request and I will knock off $50 off the price.

Basically I wanted an $20 [GMK color ring](https://uniqey.net/en/gmk-color-ring), but Uniqey's minimum shipping cost to the US is $31, and the shipping cost is the same up to 1kg of goods, so I figured I'll buy some extras to sell on Mechmarket, both to try to make back that huge shipping cost, and to provide color rings to those in the US at a much lower cost than Uniqey (\~$30 shipped for 1 ring instead of \~$50 shipped).

If you want to design GMK keycaps in the  future this is extremely useful, as using GMK stock colors means you can skip color matching, and allow you to have a lower MOQ. This is also useful if you're buying a lot of GMK sets as a lot of sets use stock colors and you can have them as a color reference. You can also remove them from their wire (which unscrews apart) and use them as sort-of-blanks and [do a rainbow across your top row](https://imgur.com/mtSNi6R) or something.

Got to make room for future projects, so letting go of a couple of great starter keebs today.  
1) Filco Minila Air - £65  
2) Cherry G80-8000 - £75  

Description:  
1) Thought this one would be a fixer-upper but after I gave it a cleanup it was pretty nice! Probably the most solid stock keeb I've tried. As you may expect, the browns aren't the most tactile, but they actually feel pretty smooth and sound quite nice. Here are some sound tests: [with OEM keycaps](https://i.imgur.com/XTEXgUn.mp4) [with GMK keycaps](https://i.imgur.com/gqNuYLp.mp4) [with PBT XDA profile keycaps](https://i.imgur.com/QdDJlqG.mp4).  
There are [DIP switches](https://deskthority.net/wiki/File:Filco_Minila_backplate_1.jpeg) at the back so you can change a few things about the layout. Sadly I only have the OEM keycaps for the layout in the picture.  
I know layout compatibility can be a real issue with Minilas, so if you're planning to use it with Cherry profile keycaps I can include the ePBT 3u spacebars in the timestamp, as well as a 1u R4 Delete key, 2u R4 blanks for left shift. (I might have a couple of other suitable blanks as well like R2 1.5u backspace, let me know if you're interested and I'll rummage.) I'll also include some shorter Costar inserts, as the stock ones can be a fraction too long to fit in shorter keycaps. 

2) Cherry G80-8000LUVGB (ISO-UK layout) [in it's original packaging](https://i.imgur.com/4iRf5HL.jpg). I've only taken it out to check that it's working and to do a [sound test.](https://i.imgur.com/QOLBxLv.mp4) It's got MX blacks, 2019 date code so most likely retooled? They feel quite smooth for stock switches, and as it's PCB mount, you can mod them without desoldering. There's [no wear on the lasered keycaps.](https://i.imgur.com/cNOYzOm.jpg)  

Prices include paypal fees but not shipping*. Also feel free to offer me trades, especially for interesting kits or keycap sets!

I'll be moving soon and I just don't have the time to assemble these keyboards, so I'll be selling these kits. These are basically brand-new, I only opened them to verify the parts but otherwise original packaging is all there. All prices in USD. Each product name has a link to the image.

~~[LZ CLS MS](https://i.imgur.com/wUVc6NV.jpg): https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=96377.0 This one's silver with a clear plastic (?) plate. I originally paid 535, so I'm asking for 500 or best offer.~~ 

~~[Eve Meteor](https://i.imgur.com/MZev4iA.jpg): https://en.zfrontier.com/products/eve-meteor Color is pale ink. I originally paid 310, so I'm asking 300 or best offer.~~

~~[GMK Penumbra](https://i.imgur.com/T00l2Qw.jpg): Never used, everything is there. I paid 160, so asking 140 or best offer.~~

I'll be closing this up Friday September 28 10 PM Pacific, so that's when I'll be looking through offers. Anything that's unsold I suppose I'll have to find time to build xD

Edit: Everything is sold now. Thanks! I'll have more to sell in the future xD

Disclaimer: I'm not a keyboard distributor, just an amateur hobbyist, so I can't guarantee that everything works perfectly.

Hey everyone, just hunting for some spicy trades. Kinda looking for a 65+% with nice linears, hotswap would be a bonus.  Ideally a trade of both the board and WoB for a board + keycap set, or just the board for another board, 1:1. KBD67mkii seems the most feasible in this price range.

Preferably want UK/EU trades, but I can make US trades happen.

**EDIT - I AM NOW LOOKING TO SELL THE BOARD, FOR WHAT I PAID INITIALLY. 360GBP + SHIPPING. FREE SHIPPING FOR UK BUYERS. I SHIP WORLDWIDE - EDIT: SOLD NOW**

I am offering my built Switch Couture ElectroType Acrylic Alice, with Zealios v2 67g lubed with Krytox 205g0, thicc filmed. It has shelf liner at the bottom to make the sound more deep. It also has Durock Stabilisers lubed with 205g0. I am also offering my GMK WoB (from drop, full base kit).

**I'm quite open to what you have to offer, as long as it isn't an acrylic board. Hmu with what you have!**

If you need any more info/questions, don't hesitate to comment. Please comment before PM. Cheers","[EU-UK] [H] Built Acrylic Alice (lubed + filmed Zealios V2 67g, foam modded), GMK WoB [W] Trades"

Cable is brand new, unused. Received it two weeks ago from Swift Cables and didn't like the colors as much as I thought I would. The cable would probably pair nicely with GMK Sumi. It is USB C device side and USB A host side. Not gold plated.

This is my first time selling here but I do have several confirmed trades on [r/AVexchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/AVexchange/). Check out my profile.

Selling my Tada68 that's been used for about 2 weeks. Selling it because I'm making space for a bunch of acrylics I've ordered that are heading my way.

Here's a sound test: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zawr6DaJmMI&feature=emb\_title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zawr6DaJmMI&feature=emb_title).

Literally no marks of use on the keeb, pristine condition. The PCB is the mini usb version, without rgb. I've also added a BUNCH of polyurethane foam inside the case, as there is a lot of space to fill in and sounds infinitely better with it. The keycaps kit is the core kit that's practically a TKL kit, so the right shift is a 1.25, right ctrl, alt, fn are from the alternate arrow kit, and the page up and down caps are R1 and R2. If anyone that buys the keyboard wants the proper mod keys, there is a mod+ kit that has them on Aliexpress and KPRepublic.

Kit is $200 before shipping, only DHL (shipping cost will vary depending on location).

Hey everyone, I posted these boards a few days ago and now I am lowering the price! I am letting these go to make way for a couple of GBs that I'm planning on joining in the past few months. Plus they deserve a better home than sitting in their boxes on my shelf. They were both used for about 2 weeks each, so they are pretty close to deadstock condition. They both also have solder PCBs and the keycaps are included with each board!

CLOSED - Please do not pm me regarding any items on this post at the moment. I’ve already edited that I will make an updated post, so I am sorry but I will ignore all messages that come through until then.

EDIT: Pending Trade

EDIT 2: Offer fell through, will post later down the line with updated guidelines for local trades only.

Note: Not looking to sell. This is currently my only board due to relocating, and I am just looking to change things up. Unless someone can find a deal for a Rama Koyu, or other high end boards, I am not looking to sell this board.

Hey guys, been using my Sat 75 for a few months now, thought for a long time it was my grail board but now I’m looking for a new experience. A-Stock, built with UHMWPE storm’s alpacas, lubed and filmed. I’m the second owner of this board, the build felt and sounds great so I don’t think it’s necessary to change it. Also comes with its original carrying case. It’s #2/250, but I’ve had to temporarily relocate due to covid so I don’t have the card on my right now. If you would like, I can have the card sent out separately on a later date, not sure if anyone would want that.

I also have 3 extra brass plates that I had cut out in anticipation for future builds that I can throw in for some extra paypal.

The board itself is in perfect condition, as far as I can tell, it’s just been sitting on my desk. I can take more photos per request on serious offers only.

GMK Peaches and cream are up for $300, which is the amount I paid for without shipping or taxes. Planned to use them for a different build, but I no longer plan on using them, just trying to gain what I lost.

Currently I’m only looking for trades for a Rama Koyu+PayPal (depending on the board) or other similarly priced high end boards (iron165 etc.). Not looking to spend paypal on my end. Will prioritize local trades (Toronto), people with good trade records, then bundles.

22-08-2020 20:00

Offering up my Drop CTRL black high-profile that's about two months old now. The main reason I want to sell this is because I ordered it in black when I meant to get silver.

I have both disassembled it (to replace the stabs with GMK ones that have been lubed and clipped, and to add some foam to dampen it) it and tried out different switches in it, so the plate has some minor signs of my taking the switches out. Otherwise, it is good as new and completely functional as you'd expect.

Comes with the original keycap and switch puller, Halo Clear switches, and unused stock keycaps (not the SA keycaps that are currently on it unless you're willing to pay extra for somewhat worn keycaps).

Willing to sell for 200 euros + shipping and Paypal.

Hello everyone, hope you are all well and having a nice weekend. Looking to clear out my drawers a bit. Will prioritize bundles if you'd like multiple items. Please comment here before PMing. If there is a race condition for an item it goes to the person whose comment Reddit tells me came first. All prices include shipping. Sorry, only looking to ship to the US at the moment. Everything is OBO and I will try to be pretty proactive about posting what is pending, sold, etc but I'll be doing chores and running errands today.

[HHKB with MX Sliders and HASU USB](https://i.imgur.com/P2qzwtt.jpg) \- Black HHKB Pro 2 with RF RGB sliders on the 1U and JTK Sliders for the mods, regular Topre Slider and stabilizer for the spacebar. Has wired HASU controller in it. Not sure what the consensus is on the RF RGB sliders is but I think they're pretty good and they keep keycaps from tilting. Board is swapped with BKE light domes for nice poppy tactility and is lightly lubed. Board has a pretty shitty stickerbomb if I'm being honest ([see pics](https://i.imgur.com/8uWCvIk.jpg)). If purchasing with the Domikey HHKB set I'll throw in free Topre sliders but I'm not going to swap them for you (sorry). I have multiple spacebars I can send along as well. $300 OBO Shipped

[Domikey Topre HHKB Set](https://i.imgur.com/P2qzwtt.jpg) \- Bought this off of drop a while back and never used it. Color scheme is straight lifted from SA Hack'd by Geeks and the legends look ok. These domikey sets are pretty unique as they are double-shot which allows them to be more colorful than most other Topre sets. Can bundle with HHKB for a discount (including Topre sliders). $75 OBO shipped ($50 w/ HHKB).

[R1 Drop Holy Pandas x 175](https://i.imgur.com/clf526J.jpg) \- These are from the original Drop Holy Panda run. I bought 180 but I tested out a few I guess. They have not been opened. From what I understand these had inconsistent factory lubing so they might need a little TLC. These were put into a hotswap board for a time but typed on only sparingly. Drop is also running a GB for these right now so if you don't have a reason to get R1s I'd go for that one as these are marked up over those. $240 OBO shipped

[SA Bliss Bundle (Base, Novs, Spacebars)](https://i.imgur.com/gEH4N0W.jpg) \- Would like to keep these together. Shipped together in a bag. These were on one of my boards for about a week but they look brand-new to me. Naterly is about to run an R2 for these in a sculpted profile with some really cool new alphas and modifier sets [https://www.instagram.com/p/CD16DuQnh7k](https://www.instagram.com/p/CD16DuQnh7k) so by all means hold out for those if you can.

[~~DSA Crap Bag~~](https://i.imgur.com/DNHadmN.jpg) ~~- Pretty sure there is a complete set you could scrabble together from the caps in this bag. Parts from DSA Navy, DSA Lightcycle, DSA Dolch, DSA Peach, DSA Ice Cream, DSA Legacy and I think a few others). Used bits and pieces to make some unique set for friend's boards. The left-overs are just taking up space now. There are a few XDA Godspeed novs thrown in there too. $50 OBO shipped~~ Sold with Switch Crap bag for $100 combined

[~~Switch Couture Stacked POM Alice~~](https://i.imgur.com/J5iDBQT.jpg) ~~- Has a Project Keyboard PCB in there and is build with Tactile Trash Pandas (why? I have no idea) with VoCos on the stabilized keys so that the extra pins help align them. The POM is translucent enough that the underglow can be seen but it's not extremely bright. Noise suppression bumpons are used in lieu of feet and give a bit of a bouncy feel.

Edit 1: Only GMK Oblivion is available now. Everything else is SOLD. 

Selling some stuff today that I no longer use. I bought all these off MM, so the prices reflect what I have invested into them. So here we go:

1\] PC WKL Salamander -> $900 shipped CONUS -- SOLD !!

\- Unbuilt, comes with a SS weight and plate both mirror shined. Plate is mirror shined on the top surface. The SS parts are very easy to wipe clean (much better than PVD brass). The plate was cut separately by sendcutsend and wasn't a part of the original GB.

\- Comes with 2 PCBs. Hiney H87A (desoldered once cleanly using a FR301, all keys tested working), Infinity A87. Both these PCS are in QMK/VIA.

\- Also comes with a Taeha / TX bag as shown  in pictures.

\- Flawless condition. Please check the album :)

2\] Black Taichi WKL -> $650 shipped CONUS -- SOLD !!

\- Unbuilt. Comes with SS accent and probably one of the most unique weight designs. Come with extra aluminium silver weights as well.

\- 2 plates (aluminium and red FR4), 2 PCBs (OG PCB and Infinity A87). The infinity A87 is in QMK/VIA.

\- Flawless condition. Very cool side profile and weight. Please check the album. :)

3\] GMK Oblivion V2 Git Hagoromo base -> $250 shipped in bags CONUS -- SOLD !!

\- Git base mods and hagoromo cadet alphas as I like that colorway more than the grey alphas.

&#x200B;

For trades, I'm only looking for a LZ-MP but I know it'll be a rare find.

Please don't hesitate to message me to offer. Please comment here before PM.

Timestamp for Pexon PCs cable:  [https://imgur.com/a/GJNE0n3](https://imgur.com/a/GJNE0n3)

Hey everyone, enjoyed this little venture into vintage boards, but would like to sell these onto some people that could get more use out of them. Also looking to trade my acrylic alice + GMK WoB (not splitting these 2, full set) **for any built/unbuilt board with nice linears, or a hotswap board (metal plate either way). Might add paypal if you have something cool, and will accept other end adding paypal, or just trading the alice and not WoB.**

**Also selling a cable from Pexon PCs. 6 inch coil, 6ft length, 550 blood red with white techflex. I'd like 35 GBP + shipping (paid 59GBP)**

For the Acrylic Alice, it is a **Switch Couture** one, with lubed (205g0) Zealios v2 67g, thicc filmed. I also added some shelf liner at the bottom to make the sound deeper, as I found the sound to be too high pitched when I got it. It also has lubed Durock stabs, and I flashed VIA onto it.

&#x200B;

Next, I have a Dell AT102W with **linearised black alps**, and an Ortek MCK-201SX with **green alps clones** (linears).

~~For the~~ **~~Dell AT102W:~~** ~~I bought it from ebay for~~ **~~55GBP~~**~~, and in great condition.~~

~~I linearised the black alps switches by removing the tactile leaves (I have them still), and then lubed the switches with 3203. Cool thing with alps is that you can open the switches without desoldering. I lubed the stabs with 205g0 and they turned out way better than I expected.~~

~~I then added a layer of shelf liner below the PCB, and then a ton in the top part and some in the bottom part. My only gripe with this board was that comparing to most other enthusiast boards, it reverbs like shit. This reduced it a LOT.~~

~~These black alps are~~ **~~extremely smooth~~** ~~and very well weighted. I personally prefer them to NK creams and vintage blacks. This would be a perfect board for someone looking to get into some nice linears without the high price tag. Refer to the sound test!~~

~~It has~~ **~~FCC ID GYUM90SK. Also is ps/2, not USB. I can guide you on how to get the board working for you.~~**

~~I would like~~ **~~55GBP + shipping~~** ~~for this one.~~ **~~Free shipping if you are in the UK~~**~~. I have done over 6 hours of work on this board.~~ [~~here~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvDluHoe7ro) ~~is a very thorough review on this specific board.~~

For the **Ortek MCK-201SX**: I bought it from ebay for **60GBP**, in great condition.

The process was basically the same for this board. Except the switches were extremely hard to open, and it took me around 6-7 hours to just lube everything. reassembling and foam mod took another hour or so. All switches were pretty scratchy initially, with a few of them binding pretty badly. The stock springs are not so good (comparable to vintage black stock springs). Lubing completely solved the binding issue and made them a whole lot smoother. Refer to the before and after sound tests that I did.

The main attraction of this board is the beautiful doubleshot ABS keycaps, with hebrew sublegends. These feel way better than the laser etched caps of the AT102W, and for that reason I think I prefer this board overall.

Note; this board has a 5 pin DIN connector, and I have a 5 pin DIN to ps/2 active converter that I can include for free if you don't have one.

I would also like **55GBP + shipping** for this one. **Free shipping if you are in the UK.**

Hey MM,

I'm Buddy and I have been customizing Topre keyboards for the most part of 2020. I spent months of trial and error and RnD to be able to get the best feeling I can from my keyboards. My most recent project was this FC980C that I have for sale.

&#x200B;

This keyboard comes with RGB sliders, JTK stabilizers, and a topre spacebar, all silenced.  The keycaps are GMK Sky Dolch with Miami accents, and comes with a matching Miami Dolch 5FT cable wrapped in carbon techflex.  The stabilizer keys have been [modified](https://i.imgur.com/U7UMyjK.jpg) to fit this keyboard without bottoming out.

&#x200B;

Here is [my guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gdfxiHNWvrKFFm3N3_wlSPLU37KYXQ2PwfvFsgd_bzc/edit) to all the modifications done.

It has a [custom laser cut gasket](https://i.imgur.com/MIFQVdB.jpg) installed between the painted base plate and the slider housings, making a noticeable improvement in the feeling of the upstroke.

7.5oz of adhesive weights in the case make this keyboard **20% heavier** than original.

Keys: GMK Sky Dolch with Miami accents

Domes: Uniform 45g

[Sliders](https://i.imgur.com/mUCR9Xm.jpg):  Krytox 205g2, Silencing rings, RGB sliders, and a topre spacebar

[Stabilizers](https://i.imgur.com/lnNZvM0.jpg): Tribosys 3204 on the silenced JTK MX slider, Heat shrink and superlube for stabilizer bar.

[PCB](https://i.imgur.com/G0vEqXS.jpg): Landing pads for the [stabilizers](https://i.imgur.com/pBUWCDn.jpg) and [spacebar](https://i.imgur.com/m9dTHWq.jpg). Thin layer of Superlube quiets capacitive springs

Case: Iridescent Turquoise, weighted

Plate: Iridescent Turquoise

1.	~~Cannonkeys Rekt1800 Navy A-Stock | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/YbwntcS) | [Sound Check] | (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NL7pWsryo4) | Built with 3204-lubed FFF linear switches and 205g0-lubed Durock stabs on a 6.25U FR4 plate. Chassis is in excellent condition, polyfill is already installed for improved sound. Comes with extra 7U plate and Cannonkeys carrying sleeve. Asking for $600 + shipping~~ **SOLD for asking**

2.	~~Cannonkeys Savage65 Black. Unsure of which stock quality this was, but has a few nicks (really, just a few. this isn’t an abused board by any stretch of the imagination).

3.	~~[Southpaw65 in Black Anodized](https://imgur.com/a/7zxbj4q).Really cool layout, and every effort has been made to design this board to be as compact as possible. A good match with DSA keycaps for a super-low profile. ~~Built with Polar Zandas (Zealios stem in YOK Polar housing) and mixed GMK/Durock stabilizers on a~~ floating black anodized aluminum plate, ~~with a 6.25U spacebar, 1U right-hand mods, split backspace, and stepped capslock. Is capable of splitting the numpad + and Enter even more~~. ~~Dampening foam between plate and PCB. Tray mounted PCB with rubber dampener. Comes with brand new bumpons, as the originals have fallen off due to weak adhesive. As with the Savage65 above, this chassis has a few nicks. Asking for $225+shipping~~ **SOLD for asking**

4.	~~KBDfans 5deg Black build. DZ60 PCB, floating polished brass plate, 3204-lubed Outemu Sky 68g switches and snap-in PCB-mount Cherry stabs. 6.25U spacebar, 1U right-hand mods, split backspace, stepped Capslock.

[**BOARD**](https://imgur.com/gallery/YZBHI70). 

~~I have both colors of MGA standard (alu alice), and would like to sell one. My preference in what color I sell is black top/silver bottom>all silver>silver top/black bottom>all black. It will also come with a white pom plate and hotswap alice pcb. All four halves have minor ano imperfections around the screw holes on the inside. The only external flaws are a tiny finish imperfection on the right side of the silver bottom, visible in the gallery, and the black bottom has a small dent on the very front, which I took a picture of. Neither is noticeable in use. As far as I can tell nobody has sold this board aftermarket. I'll set a buy out of $500? and will also accept trade offers for 60% boards (and $$$ offers).~~ SOLD SILVER FOR ASKING. If anybody is interested in the black for that price I might be convinced to sell it too.

Hey guys, 

Just trying to sell a few things here and there. 

Listed prices includes Paypal fees and USPS First Class shipping. Feel free to OBO (can only offer me less) on stuff but will give priority to trades, bundles, and my listed price. Not entirely FCFS either as I might give priority to people who've been searching for things specifically. 

Have | Details | Want
---|---|---
SP SA Pulse | Noire, Rams, and 7u Spacebars kits. Doesn't have noticeable shine but some caps do have small scratches and one has dents on the side (see pictures). Not that noticeable imo and tend to come that way since SP ships in bags. Highly prefer to bundle as its a complete set this way. | Trades or $160
IMK Corne | Charcoal (Black) and untented version. I've never actually built this sadly and kept putting it off so it's entirely going to waste on me. If you're willing to wait for R2, I believe that is coming up soon. Comes with everything you need for both a regular MX AND a Choc low profile build. Prefer to keep as a bundle. | Trades or $270
SuitedUpKeycaps Keybuto III | Abyss Gokaden w/ Extra Crest and Mask | $75 or Trades
Keyforge Saber | Arsenic (Green). These are Topre stem only. | $40 or Trades
Keyforge Saber | Royal Slate (Blue). Topre stem only. | $40 or Trades
Brocaps Bronin | Fused Milk | Trades or $40
Brocaps Bronin | Defused Grey | Trades or $40

Hey there r/mm,
 
In light of recent events, I will be putting the mechanical keyboard hobby behind me, albeit short-lived in my opinion (about a year), I am sad to leave such an incredible and heartwarming community, but, all good things must come to an end.

I have a few things I have for sale and trust they’ll find a good home:

KBD 8X WKL in Black: Was planning on this being my first real custom mech, however, just have not been given the right opportunity to do so. Unbuilt, only unboxed to take a look at! Looking to get back what I paid for it. $450 shipped SOLD

Ducky One 2 Mini: My first gaming keeb! MX Browns. Missing 1-6, Q-R, and A-D keycaps, works flawlessly, comes in original box and all original accessories. I can throw in some tai hao pink rubber keycaps at no charge to cover all aforementioned keycaps! $80 shipped.

Ducky One 2 TKL: Used for a few months, flawless condition prior to diving into the rabbit hole that is mechanical keyboards. $115 shipped. SOLD

My first 60% Build that led to the rabbit hole...: Built with KBD 5 Degree case, DZ60 RGB PCB (hotswap), and Durock Stabs lubed with 205g0 (transparent), and Tealios V2s lubed with 205g0 (comes with 18 extra switches just in case anything fails down the road!) and a 3mm thick piece of foam from MKUltra. $200 shipped. SOLD

Drop ALT Hi Pro: Black, used for a couple months, lubed, clipped and bandaided stabs. $220 shipped.

Gat Ink Black V2s: 84 stock, 16 Lubed and filmed with 205g0 and TX films in black (will include the remainder of the films to complete all switches). Lubed swtiches will be in a sperate bag inside NK bag Inks originally came in. Never soldered, only put in hotswap board once. $90 shipped.

NK Creams: 77 stock, 23 lubed with 205g0. Never soldered or used in hotswap board. Lubed creams in separate bag inside of original NK they were shipped in. $80 shipped.

GMK Oblivion R2: purchased from here a few months back, only real shine is on 6.25U spacebar and WASD keys (primarily gaming) $200 shipped in bags. SOLD for $210 in trays!

Durock Stabs (each kit includes 1x7U, 1x6.25U, and 4x2U stabs purchased from ringerkeys) : 2 kits of smokey colored and one transparent colored. $25 shipped each kit, if bundled I can do all 3 for $65 shipped. SOLD FOR ASKING

Two cables from ZAP Cables and one from Coaxius cables (ALL USB C):
-          (ZAPCables) Black techflex and black paracord @ 5ft $30 shipped.
-          (ZAP Cables) Carbon BTI MDPC cover (grey) and black paracord with Aviator connector @ 5ft $60 shipped.
-          (Coaxius) Black techflex with black paracord, aviator connector, and 6 inch coil @ 5 ft $80 shipped.

Desk mats: Olivia ++ desk mat, only opened once to look at, dark color way $60 shipped.

iSwitch deskmat: never used. $40 shipped. 
 


To anyone and everyone that has answered addressed any inquires I have ever had, or piece of advice offered, I thank you, and hope that sometime in the future I can return to this incredibly unique (and expensive hobby).

Selling this KBD67MKIIV2 because I wanted to try out the black color and managed to snag it off someone without it being insta-sold.

~~KBD67MKIIV2 Custom 65% Hotswap Kit - C9 (Electric Blue Color)~~|~~Used for about a month. Top-mounted. 65% Hotswap RGB PCB. Color is a bright electric blue. [It matched GMK/SA Pulse's neon blue perfectly.](https://i.imgur.com/EOM5EEJ.jpg) Please note of several additions to this board: I've fixed the brass weight's case ping. It's a bit of a design flaw they're working on fixing, but it's in all current batches as of now. I've used a layer of electric tape on the back of the weight. This removes the nasty ping. I'll also throw in the case foam that came along with it, this is still lacking plate foam (plate foam got released after I already brought the kbd67 and case foam :-(). You can have the Durock Stabilizers too. They're generously lubed entirely with Krytox 205g0. **For the newbies: This includes everything you need EXCEPT*the switches* and *the keycaps* (and the USB-C cable too ig).~~|~~$355 to CON-US~~ **Sold to /u/YoungBoyWonder**|~~$350 + International Shipping (priority is still to USA > CAN > Int')~~
~~Gaterion Black Ink SPRINGS~~|~~I don't need these because they're too heavy for my liking. To make things better: it's lubed with GPL-107 in the bag. About 70 provided.~~|~~$12 Shipped~~ **Sold to /u/Jalapeno28**|~~USA only, sorry.~~
Novelkey Silks - Yellow|68 of them are stock and been used for about two weeks in a hotswap board, I helped spread out the stock lube, you're welcome ;). Not a single lick of solder or modifications. Well... except 2. I lubed and filmed 2 of them before looking for another linear. In a nutshell: 67 worked in for two weeks, 1 left untouched/unused, 2 are unused and filmed and lubed. You still get you're 70 like-new Novelkey Silk Yellows. Paid $45 for it, want $55 to get my money back after PayPal fees and shipping|$55 Shipped to CON-US|$50 + International Shipping

Hi everyone, I have the following for sale. All prices in USD.

&#x200B;

~~GMK STRIKER BASE + NUMPAD - $400 + SHIPPING~~    **SOLD**

(can ship in bags or tray, shipping in bags will be easier and cheaper)

There is very minimal shine, still pretty good imo.

* Spent my time with this lovely set, but since I no longer have a board that suits it well, looking to let it go.
* I used it for about a month or so, I tried to show the minimal shine on WASD and QWER but I'm not sure it really shows
* Not looking to split unless I have a buyer for each
   * 350 for base
   * 50 for numpad

&#x200B;

BUILT PC KBD67MKII HOTSWAP - $500 + SHIPPING

Not exactly a beginner board, but it's a good set to start off your keyboard journey if you're new to the hobby.

Shipped with the hex key that came w it and extra hardware.

&#x200B;

* BolsaKeyboardSupply MKII plate and case foam
* Brass Plate + Pom Plate + Solder Pom Plate
   * The solder pom plate can be used with 5 pin switches, but you'd need to remove the plate foam
   * The black pom plate has issues with screw hole placement but
* Alphas plus main mod keys are all cherry-topped gateron ink blacks, then I ran out of tops so I used regular ink blacks
* V2 Gateron Ink Blacks (will include 2 extra normal gat inks)
   * Cherry Tops (a deeper sound from what I can hear)
   * Lubed with 205g0
   * Filmed with clear TX Films
   * TX 65g Springs lubed with 105 (will include an extra 40 springs already lubed)
* Zeal Stabs lubed with 205g0
* There's 2-3 black dots on the bottom of the case that came like that.

&#x200B;

or you can take both items for an amazing grand total of $870 + shipping

I have a brand new, still packaged and wrapped set of GMK Serika available. I also have the micons, but these don’t come with the original box. I bought them from someone who opened them and said he never used them, and I haven’t touched them since. There are no signs of wear so I believe the original seller that these are unused.

|~~KBD67mkii Grey Hotswap~~|~~$350 shipped~~ (Sold for asking)|~~Anodization is perfect except for a slight mark on the inside of the base. Has relatively drastic color mismatch IMO, though. No longer needed, a board I thought was lost in shipping finally arrived/ after 4 months.~~|

I also fully lubed the stems (including the legs) in order to cut down on tactility a bit. These are more tactile than 65g and 67g variants, and I did not want to swap a heavier spring in. Even after lubing the legs, they're still to tactile for me, so I have moved on from using them at all.~~|

-       Built with Zealios v2 62g lubed with Tribosys 3024

Hello, back with another post to help clean out stuff prior to my pending GBs finally arriving. Some of this stuff hurts to see leave, but I hope they end up in better homes.Please read all the details of each listing carefully, as I will 100% roast you if you ask me anything that I cover in the details.

Item|Details|Price|Available
:--|:--|:--|:--
HHKB Pro JP | Are you trying to have the thockiest keyboard you can get? Ever wanted an HHKB but couldn't stand that it didn't have more keys? The HHKB Pro JP is for you! not only does it come with extra keys, it also has *dedicated* arrow keys. Purchased this board used from Japan in great condition. Stabs have been lubed with dielectric grease, and sliders have been lubed with 205g0. Deskeys #3 silencing rings have been installed. Hasu controller has also been installed and is currently running VIA (which has been REALLY nice to have on this because of the different layout). Will include extra Deskeys #3 silencing rings, extra Keyclack (RIP) v2 silencing rings (adhere to housings rather than placed on the sliders), and the original controller. With regards to my pricing, it's only a few dollars above what I paid for everything. | $250 shipped | **SOLD FOR ASKING PRICE**
MT3 Serika | Mounted on boards twice, but have seen maybe about a month of use altogether. Includes katakana alphas, modifiers, superhoming kit (for individuals of culture), extra mods (for your weird layouts including split ergo a.k.a. Alice), geometries, and arrows. There are two 7U spacebars included, because the original 7U spacebar was basically non-functional out of the box. I have since fixed that spacebar (works even on v1 C3 stabs), and there is only the slightest amount of warp, probably better than more recent GMK sets. Drop sent a replacement spacebar that is absolutely perfect with no warp whatsoever. **Not splitting kits unless all kits are accounted for separately in PMs.** | $260 shipped | **SOLD FOR ASKING PRICE**

**Artisans**

Item|Details|Price|Available
:--|:--|:--|:--
Shellbrain Naru | ono.key; sculpt is based on Naru from Ori and the Blind Forest. The light blue didn't match as well as I had hoped with the keyset I wanted to pair it with. | $45 shipped | yes!
White Pain | Brewcaps; very much an impulse buy. No current plans to mount a white artisan, so I just wanna pass it onto someone at a loss. **Price is below retail+shipping** | $20 shipped | **SOLD FOR ASKING PRICE**
Burple Spoop | Eldritch Keycaps; very much an impulse buy from the first round of Spoops and slightly different than the metallic purple that went on sale recently. However, this will arrive much sooner than however long it took me to get this shipped from Oceania region. | $35 shipped | **SALE PENDING**

All prices include shipping within USA, sale is not FCFS. You _can_ message me with an offer, worst I'll say is either no or ""sold out, sorry."" It'll be very difficult to convince me to ship international because of how bad mailing in general is impacted. I have zero problems shipping to a proxy, however.

Otherwise, priority goes to the following in this order:

 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM and willing to pay asking price**, you will be invoiced as soon as I see your message if you go this route.
 * Offers for prices lower than asking but with PayPal email included in your initial PM. If I don't accept your offer, I decline or counter-offer. If I accept your offer, congrats! You didn't have to message back and forth to get the price you want.
 * buyers willing to buy multiple items together. You get bumped to the top if you buy every single item listed in the post items.
 * willing to buy for asking price

Outside of these conditions, I'll check based on when you comment and PM. Please understand that if you as a buyer and I agree on a price and you back out of the purchase right after I send the invoice, I will refuse to sell anything to you in the future (yes, that includes if you offer me something like $300 on something that I'm selling for much less).

 **Do not use the chat function**, I honestly don't know how you are taken to the chat function when the bot's verification post gives you a link to PM sellers. I will ignore you and you won't be in consideration for anything until you send me a PM.","[US-CA] [H] modded HHKB Pro JP (VIA enabled), MT3 Serika (lots of kits!), Artisans (ono.key, Brewcaps, Eldritch, all priced to move) [W] PayPal"

Heartbroken to get rid of this gorgeous set, but my primary work is in Adobe Creative Cloud and it proved to be a hindrance as soon as I had to look down to find specific keys rather than relying on muscle memory, which I had no problems with.

Hi guys, It is time to move on and let some of my favorite boards go. Let's start here:


**KBD8X MKI** excluding Miami Nights keycaps - 
including Drop + Oblotzky GMK Oblivion V2 Custom Keycap Set + Space Keys Kit 

**360 Euro** (excl. shipping)


Breakdown:  
Board 200 Euro. 
Keyset 160 Euro. 


Switches:  
T1 stems in Bsun housing (67g) on alphas & mods / 
Aliaz (70g) on F-row & top right mod cluster (above cursors) 

[Layout](https://imgur.com/ZyeW8qI)

Case:  
Two small specs in top case, scratch around screw sink back case (see images) 
Dynamat installed in case and under aluminium plate

PCB:  
I bought the PCB broken on the R3s and did some small surgery (added new diodes and re-wired lifted pads) [see pic](https://imgur.com/ULdR3Q7).
I am afraid that this PCB will not survive another desoldering.

I'm selling some things i won't have use anymore as i got two iron165's: one of them for my office and the other one for home. A lot has changed from last October to now as we moved mostly to home office environment, so i won't have any need for the second one, unfortunately.

Cafe sets were bought for those two keyboards but when Red Sam R2 was launched (my first love..) i decided to go with that for my home build.

Everything is in new condition. Tried to make a lot of pictures of the Iron165 from all sides so you can see there are no flaws with it.

**Shipping:**

* Prefer to keep it EU.
* Can use either DHL Express or DPD Economy. DHL (only Express available here) are quite expensive and can be used for Iron165 because of the higher price of the product. For EU it is \~70 € based on my last call with them. DPD prices are \~ 15-30 € depending on country. [https://www.speedy.bg/en/dpd-economy](https://www.speedy.bg/en/dpd-economy) : Here you can check prices for DPD and approximate delivery times.

Hey guys, 

Just trying to sell a few things here and there. 

Listed prices includes Paypal fees and USPS First Class shipping. Feel free to OBO (can only offer me less) on stuff but will give priority to trades, bundles, and my listed price. Not entirely FCFS either as I might give priority to people who've been searching for things specifically. 

Have | Details | Want
---|---|---
SP SA Pulse | Noire, Rams, and 7u Spacebars kits. Doesn't have noticeable shine but some caps do have small scratches and one has dents on the side (see pictures). Not that noticeable imo and tend to come that way since SP ships in bags. Highly prefer to bundle as its a complete set this way. | Trades or $165
IMK Corne | Charcoal (Black) and untented version. I've never actually built this sadly and kept putting it off so it's entirely going to waste on me. If you're willing to wait for R2, I believe that is coming up soon. Comes with everything you need for both a regular MX AND a Choc low profile build. Prefer to keep as a bundle. | Trades or $270
Nautilus Nightmares | Rama Enter | $80 or Trades
SuitedUpKeycaps Keybuto III | Abyss Gokaden w/ Extra Crest and Mask | $80 or Trades

Hello all! I purchased these three KBD67 MKIIs to practice dying after my initial attempt with my own went [very well](https://imgur.com/gallery/kioVU3N). I thought it might be a neat idea to offer PC case dying services, but wanted to make sure I had a repeatable process down that yielded good results.

I'll be straight with you, these are nowhere near perfect. The blue one turned out the best, but still has a few inconsistent splotches. One of the biggest challenges I dealt with this time was fingerprints. I didn't notice any finger print issues the last time I did this, but all of three of these cases did this time. I made sure to clean these off prior to dying them, so I don't know if  I managed to get them on there myself after cleaning them, or if they were handled prior with some sort of residue that etched itself into the plastic. Other than that, two of the cases came with dents/chips in them and they all had a few small striations that became more prominent once the clear PC was dyed. Please refer to the timestamp album to see closeups of all the boards, with imperfections highlighted.

That said, here is what I'm asking for these boards, priced based upon dye job quality and condition of the board. If you feel as though my pricing is off or unreasonable, please let me know:

&#x200B;

|Item|Price|Available?|
|:-|:-|:-|
|~~Blue PC KBD67 MKII - This one came out the best, has a few splotches, but not too many, and the condition of this board is the best overall. I love the color of this one the most.~~|$390 - shipped conus|No|
|~~Purple PC KBD67 MKII - This one is arguably more consistent that the blue one on the outside, but the inside has pretty bad splotches (but wont be see once built). Unfortunately this board came with a small ding on one of the bottom corners and a small gouge on the bottom. The purple is very deep and dark, would look good with GMK First Love maybe?~~|$350 - shipped conus|No|
|~~Navy PC KBD67 MKII - This one came out the worst in terms of consistency. Pretty obvious splotching on the top edge, some on the bottom, and the front lip of the top case came chipped. The Navy came out SUPER dark, almost black. This may look good with GMK Deep Navy? Potentially GMK Sumi, however the blue isn't quite dark enough to match.~~|$300 - shipped conus|No|

I'll continue to testing dying methods, but as of right now, dying services aren't going to happen in the near future - at least not until I get a solid dying process nailed.

Edit: forgot to mention, all three boards are hotswap and come with case and plate foams.

Edit: after thinking about it I decided to lower the prices a bit on the purple and navy colors. Navy is now at cost.

Edit: no one has said anything, but I though I should make it clear that the cases weren't screwed together in the close up photos. So any gaps you see are due to that, and not any warping or anything.",[US-NC] [H] 3 Dyed PC KBD67 MKIIs [W] Paypal

* I purchased this off Drop a few years ago for $140 including taxes and shipping. Unsure what to ask for this board now, so accepting all reasonable offers. Used but good condition. This board is also compatible with both Win and Mac (I personally used this with my Mac Pro). Includes original USB cord and original box. No Keycaps.

\- ~~Asking $32 shipped OBO (~~**~~NOT~~** ~~including Cruciformer)~~

\- ~~Asking $62 shipped OBO (Including Cruciformer)~~ \- **SOLD with Cruciformer**

* Purchased these on here. This particular tactile is not for me. In order to give them a fair chance - I re-tooled all and tried them. I don't have calipers, so I can't measure, no guarantees, but none of my GMK caps cracked when I put them on to try.  Prior to re-tooling these - I retooled 100x Kailh Box Royals.  Again, unsure what to ask for the Switches alone and will consider all reasonable offers.  I'm less flexible on the price with the Switches + Cruciformer and not willing to sell it alone.

Prices for shipping are CON US.  Willing to ship international, but would cost more than listed.

For trades - looking for a White Spoop.  White or Black Zorb Sparkey.   Open to other Kailh tactile switch trades or retooled Cherry Blues so I can harvest the housings.

**47 Silk Yellows are desoldered** and have some solder left on the legs and **2 of them have clipped legs**. I have separated both soldered and unsoldered switches into separate bags (see album). Please be aware of this before buying these. Counted through twice and got total of 81.

Hi All,

Just received my ordered 1/65 Polycarbonate / Teal Aluminum wrist rest from keycult. Was hoping the angle would work with my Think6.5 but doesn’t quite line up. 

The polycarbonate has a 3 minor imperfections (one small vertical streak, and two horizontal streaks) however can only be seen at a very specific light level/angle. Did my best to capture this. 

Will ship in original packaging. 

Ideally would like to trade (+ PayPal if needed) for another GMK set. 

For anyone who absolutely wants this I’ll price it at $180 shipped CONUS because I’m really looking to put this toward a trade. 

Not interesting in anything with shine. 

Testing the waters here as it doesn’t look like any 65 rests have come across mechmarket get.

Edit: adjusted down from 200 to 180 shipped, saw another seller has sold some for 150

[Stamp of Time and username](https://imgur.com/a/pLPHTQ0)


So I bought Mizu in the extras sale months ago in preparation for a white RAMA M65-B, but I also went big and jumped into GMK Copper and will now use that.

I was extremely lucky and won a white/teal Keycult 1/60 that arrived yesterday and the teal has a lot more green tones than expected.  Mizu doesn't look right on it, and neither does my backup plan of GMK Vaporwave since the blue accent is just off enough, and just close enough that it clashes.  So I'm looking for a set that matches, if the value is different we can figure something out.  I'm really looking for GMK, but some PBT caps could work.  I don't like SA, but would trade for SA Camping (though I don't think an owner of SA Camping would or should take this trade).

I'd consider selling, but I really would prefer a trade for another unmounted GMK set.  


Thanks!

Comes with a 6.25 and 7u bottom row, both are R4. I'm not entirely sure where the mods came from, but with them being icon mods I suspect they came out of Dolch Reborn. $75 shipped.~~ sold

XDA Oblique. Base alphas, base text mods, accents, novelties, numpad, compatability, spacebars and blanks. I'm 99% sure it was all the kits offered minus katakana and icon mods. $300 shipped. Yes I know less complete sets have sold for less. No, I won't split.

Fanoe 65%. Gray top, red bottom. Clipped GMK stabilizers, built with 70g Aliaz switches. The PCB is USB-C and hotswap. As of yesterday, supports VIA Configurator thanks to yours truly.

Selling my set of GMK Oblivion v2 Git Base Kit. I used this kit on a 65% and a different set of keycaps for alphas for a couple months (about 4-5 months). Therefore the only keys I used were the modifiers (including 1.75 right shift), spacebar, top row num keys, and some navigation keys (del, insert, home, end).

Modifiers (except caps lock and left ctrl, shine comparable to num keys) + navigation keys have little shine. Top num keys (especially 1-3 from gaming) + spacebar  have some shine. Alphas, FN keys, numpad keys, etc. are all new and never mounted.

Will include all keycaps and the tray. Extra keys will come in a ziploc bag + the corrected ""Hello World"" keycap. Looking to sell locally first for $220 OBO. Local is 07657.

Hey there, 

Looking to sell a 40% Orthochu Keyboard Case, unused and unbuilt.

The board is effectively new. I've taken it out to check and make sure everything is alright. Brown paper from the Acrylic wrapping is still in tact. Looking to sell it mainly because I couldn't get used to the 40% layout after trying it for a month, and hence, I have left this unbuilt.

Am also looking to sell some of my personal extra Clay Artisans that I have leftover from sales. Do note that tracking is included in the price I have listed the board at. 

GMK Matrix-01 is also now up!

Hello! The time has come for me to part ways with my M60-A. Unfortunately I need the money more than I need the keyboard.

Here’s wassup:

* RAMA M60-A in Mist (silver)
* Built with Zeal stabs and Zealios of an unknown weight and production run (sorry)
* Fully lubed and greased and works perfectly, that includes the LEDs
* RAMA Internal dampener and upgraded hardware
* Full set of GMK Originative, minor shine on WASD and space bar (gamer’s curse)
* Original box packaging and the RAMA USB C cable (even the package for the screws)

Condition:

* There is a very minor ding on the bottom front edge which cannot be seen unless the board is upside-down. (In pictures)
* There are also minor knicks under the key caps from pulling the switches to lube. Cannot be seen with caps on.
* The weight may have micro-scratches, but if they’re there I can’t see them with the lighting in my house. This thing is in very good shape.

Good afternoon,

Here we have a Rose Gold Prime\_Elise with a Brass Plate.

The reason I'm selling/trading this is because I thought I was going to enjoy a smaller form factor but realized they just aren't my cup of tea.

Despite this, this is a beautiful board that is very well crafted by Sneakbox.Design

I'm open to all offers, but to buy it outright the price is listed below

In regards to trades:

I am looking for popular GMK sets with additional cash, boards that are 60% and larger - as well anything else that you may want to offer

&#x200B;

Additionally, we have some stab kits up for sale as well as Mountain Blocks DIY kits

* If you'd like additional pictures of anything please let me know!

I have a Fusion60 in hhkb layout with extra carbon fiber half plate, and a brass plate as well. Comes with the stock pcb soldered with outemu silent clear sky(clear top and sky bottom) lubbed with 3203 and they have u4 stems. I bought them switches from Daily Clack and ended up being super expensive due to 20 euro shipping and then 40 euros on customs fees.

The stabilizers in the board are the durock clears.

&#x200B;

The solder job could be better as there are 2 wire jumps ~~and it will need re-centering on 3 or 4 switches of the bottom row~~ . The switches are very good tactiles and the board is amazing, but I find the typing angle uncomfortable for me, and maybe the fact that I put SA keycap didn't help as well.

&#x200B;

|Fusion60 Board|the case is in very good condition, minor scratches ( can be seen in the album). ~~the pcb is also in good condition but needs 3/4 switches recentered (really small difference but to be perfect it needs it). pcb also as jumpwired connection but 100% functional~~  The PCB could be in better state, it is functional as is, but I recommend not  to desolder this pcb anymore, and if there is a need to use other switches just use a different one. Either a dz60 or some hotswap tsangan layout.|\* With keycaps - 450€ shipped OBO \* Without keycaps - 380 €. Can also sell the case and the brass plate only.|

All the prices are negotiable and include PayPal fees. The price of the board includes shipping to EU. For the remaining items I will include half the price of shipping as well.

I am interested in the following items:

* Black poly think 6.5,

* key65
* Similar 65% keyboards (preferably gasket mount)
* GMK sets (new, light use)
* GMK Red Samurai
* KBD67 MII foam for case and plate (HS)

Might want to buy those items if you're not interested in the fusion60.

Edit: The switches are now aligned. There was one problem though, which was one of the pads was not in a great shape and lift up, so I had to add a new jump wire. There are 2 in total, which makes the pcb in a not so great overall condition. The price is adjusted a little bit as well. The board is compatible with most standard 60% pcb in tsangan layout, so it could be replaced by a dz60 without a problem or a hs60 hhkb, cannonkeys instant 60 for example.

haven't been around for a few years now so please tell me if i f'ed up the pricing.   
!!DISCLAIMER!!   
Due to COVID shipping overseas (us 62$) is ridiculously expensive so I’m only offering EU shipping   
All prices include paypal fee but not shipping (except free shipping to germany). This is only due to me not selling stuff that often so i wouldn't know the prices and before i need to pay 50 bucks shipping for the vim kit i sadly need to do it this way, as long as nobody offers me a sleeker solution :)

Asking 55 GBP. 

Have some extra POM plates for the kbd67v2 mkii. Plate doesn't have cut off for standoffs and is made using the files for the solderable PCB. That said you can use it for the hotswap variant as well but it's easier to do with setting up the plate/switches/keycap assembly completely and then mounting it on the board. 
Asking 35 GBP. 

Finally.. ordered way too much of an acoustic sound dampening material. It's 2mm thick, should fit a few cases. It's graded to isolate 26dB with a single layer. It's quite dense and will legitimately add weight to your build as it's reasonably heavy for its size.

Looking to trade one of my two GMK sets for either GMK Mizu or Striker base sets:

Solarized Dark - Used for a little more than a month, extremely slight shine on few alphas if any at all.

Nines R2 - Essentially brand new, only mounted once for a few minutes and taken off.

\-- SOLD FOR ASKING --

Hello all, happy mid-week to everyone and hope you are holding up.

I am looking to sell a pink / red WKL EVE Moon that I think matches the GMK Darling set very well. It comes with the original plate and PCB as well as an unbuilt set of Hiney FR4 Plate and PCB so it can be built from scratch if desired. The board is currently built with Gateron FF cheese switches. I recently replaced all of the screws on the board as some were missing or improperly matched when I received it.

I believe this is a pretty uniquely colored Moon as it was created by switching the accents and bottom from a different Moon but I don't know this for sure.

I'm looking for $1,000 shipped or best offer\*. As for shipping I really apologize but, at this point, I'm only looking to ship to the US as the state of int'l shipping is a bit of a dog these days. If you're in Southern California and would like to meet up in person (masked up!) I will give a $50 discount and probably throw some free stuff of your choice in as well.

\* To get this board from China I paid shipping to and from proxy as well as a proxy fee. With the hiney stuff included this is break-even for me.",[US-CA][H] Darling Themed EVE Moon [W] PayPal

Hello everyone! I am about to move into my first home and decided to make a decision to part ways with some things to help keep my bank account from getting wrecked buying things. This is tough as most things here I have been trying to hunt down for a long time and I’ll be sad to see it all go. If you see anything that you would like please PM me as I won’t see the chat messages and I know my inbox is about to be totally destroyed so I’d like it all to be in one area. I am only looking for sales in CONUS currently as shipping overseas makes me nervous with everything going on and it’s much more expensive. If you have any questions about anything please let me know and I will try and answer them to the best of my ability. I tried to price everything fairly and based on recent sales but if a price seems off please let me know and we can try and work something out. I also ask to please not offer more than asking price on any item as I am not allowing bidding on anything. I will try and have everything shipped within 24-48 hours of purchase. Thanks for reading my long post and thanks for looking!

It will come with the blue durock 205g0 lubed stabs as well.~~

This is a board with the flawed back weight. I will add that I can put you in contact with the person who got the board from Rama and they can talk to you about receiving the replacement for it. It also has a tiny scratch where the bottom frame meets the top but it isn’t visible from it being on a desk. I tried to show that spot the best I can in a picture. You will receive everything that is board came with from Rama (to my knowledge) an W02-A internal dampener (pre installed and this is different than the mute dampener it comes with) an assortment of colored durock stabs (blue, clear and smoked) and aviator cable that the previous owner gave to me as a throw in (no idea on the brand).~~

|[~~NOS Zenith Z150 (SKCL green)~~](https://imgur.com/a/mhjQ95x)|~~not really much to say here - it's NOS!  Probably the most notable thing about this particular board is that it works with an AT-to-PS/2 adapter.  This is the only black label board I've owned that has such a characteristic.  Normally black label Z150s need a special soarer's converter, but this one is fine without it.  Another member of the community posited that perhaps this board is just before the boards were made with white labels instead of black labels because the board has the same layout as that of the white label boards.  Seems very plausible to me but of course, I don't know. Caps are AE doubleshots. I have lowerred the price slightly from my previous listing.~~|~~$280 + shipping (final price drop for now)~~   Sold for $285 (with shipping included)|

For sale is a complete 60% board with a cable, case, and feet. The parts are as follows:

* 1UP RGB 60% PCB HSE (hot swap) ANSI w/ underglow
* universal 60% alu ANSI plate + case
* Kailh Box Heavy Dark Yellow switches
* GMK stabs, clipped and band-aided
* Fabric storage case
* USB-C cable (matches quite well)
* Black-on-gray PBT cap set (the 'gentleman' set; also has tkl kit and some novelties)
* removable alu feet

The case has a few small flaws that are pictured as clearly as I could in the album. I received it from the manufacturer this way. The PCB does not line up with the middle standoff of the case, but this does not affect the board in any way. The build has also been cleaned & disinfected to the best of my ability.

Hey guys! Looking to clean out some boards to get myself a Leopold FC660C, so here goes:

First, the Leopold fC660M. I bought this temporarily while needing a board for class, so it's very lightly used. Used it for less than a full month, and it has had the dust cover on since, so it looks and feels brand new. Completely stock, comes with the stock cable. Has Cherry MX Reds inside. Looking for around $90 + shipping.

Pictures:

Front of board - [https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Rwi\_JAeCKsIgtrgUfq\_1RNPzYBdtIj\_/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Rwi_JAeCKsIgtrgUfq_1RNPzYBdtIj_/view?usp=sharing)

Now on to the Nightfox. THis one hasn't been used for very long either. I bought it from someone on mechmarket and they had used it for around a month, and I'd say I used it for about that long as well. I'm not super fond of silent switches, so I don't want this board anymore, but it functions perfectly from what I can tell. Has lubed Cherry MX Silent Blacks, and has Everglide Screw-In stabs in all the modifiers except the spacebar. The spacebar has a GMK screw-in. All of the stabs are lubed with Krytox 205g0 to my understanding. Switces are all lubed with Tribosys 3204. I had an issue with the ""R"" key giving out, but I think it might have been my keycaps, as it seems to be working just fine now. I'd probably recommend desoldering/resoldering the ""R""  key if issues persist, but I wanted to give you guys full transparency. Spacebar also appears to be band-aid modded. Looking for around $160 OBO.

Selling a Savage65 that I purchased off here. 

**Please Read!**:

The overall condition of the board is great aside from the PCB which had a damaged pad from the previous builder (I'm the second owner). I started desoldering the board (started from the ESC key) and when I desoldered the ""3#"" key I saw that the pad was damaged and didnt continue with this build. I bridged the connector as shown in the second picture of the album so that it works but wont keep the build as I wanted to have switch this board out with some linear switches. Maybe someone with more knowledge of how to work with the pcb can fix it further. 

The board comes with the extra 6.25u FR4 plate (7u is installed) and keyboard itself built with lubed NK Blueberries and lubed GMK screw in stabs (dont have a 6.25u spacebar wire)

Sorry for the long read, but if you have any questions or concerns please feel free to ask!

* I purchased these recently on here.  I retooled all 110 - included pic of Cruciformer *only* as proof that I own one. I cannot guarantee all are perfect - I don't have calipers, so I can't measure. Prior to re-tooling these - I retooled 100x Box Royals and have no problems with them using my GMK Pulse set).

Hello! Willing to part ways with my GMK 8008 core set I have here.  I received this set sealed last Wednesday.  Opened it on Friday and has been mounted on the Tofu since. Has seen very minimal use due to the fact I haven't spent any time online this weekend (weather has been insane here).

**I don't mind sending it to the US if you're okay with paying for the shipping**. I'm also willing to trade for other GMK sets, but it really depends on the set; I particularly like GMK Oblivion V2 but I'd like some extra cash to go with that.

Only flaw is that due to being mounted several times, the caps are somewhat loose. On every switch I tried besides tangies they were still nice and snug, but on the tangies they were loose. idk if this is more of a problem with the caps or the tangies but I thought it was worth mentioning. $345 shipped in bags.

Kbd67 V2 mkii hotswap Brass plate
Asking 55 GBP. 

Have some extra POM plates for the kbd67v2 mkii. Plate doesn't have cut off for standoffs and is made using the files for the solderable PCB. That said you can use it for the hotswap variant as well but it's easier to do with setting up the plate/switches/keycap assembly completely and then mounting it on the board. 
Asking 35 GBP. 

Finally.. ordered way too much of an acoustic sound dampening material. It's 2mm thick, should fit a few cases. It's graded to isolate 26dB with a single layer. It's quite dense and will legitimately add weight to your build as it's reasonably heavy for its size. 
Let me know if there's interest and what size you want for pricing. A rough 60 percent cut out for about 25 GBP shipped.

Hello fellow MechMarket friends! I am going to be moving at the end of this month and wanted to eliminate some of the keyboard clutter I have collected over the past few months.

|[NOS Zenith Z150 (SKCL green)](https://imgur.com/a/mhjQ95x)| not really much to say here - it's NOS!  Probably the most notable thing about this particular board is that it works with an AT-to-PS/2 adapter.  This is the only black label board I've owned that has such a characteristic.  Normally black label Z150s need a special soarer's converter, but this one is fine without it.  Another member of the community posited that perhaps this board is just before the boards were made with white labels instead of black labels because the board has the same layout as that of the white label boards.  Seems very plausible to me but of course, I don't know. Caps are AE doubleshots. I have lowerred the price slightly from my previous listing. |$300 + shipping|

**Everyone who ordered over the weekend - I will get your packages shipped by this Tuesday the 11th.**

Typo in the title, it's the TKL Red Samurai Kit not 1800.

Selling my first 3 mechanical keyboards as I no longer use 60/65% boards. All boards will ship with the caps shown in bags in their respective Imgur albums, which are the caps they came with. They will NOT ship with the keycaps shown in the timestamp. I will put the keycaps on before shipping, with the extras in bags if there are any for that particular board. Cables and numpads can be bundled with other items for a discount. All prices are shipped to CONUS. Please comment before PM. I will not respond to chat messages. Thank you!

Hey /mm, widening my most recent post a little bit to include some additional items I hope to move. 

**For starters we've got a SouthPaw 65%** with left-hand numpad, Cyan colour with black plate. Perfect condition, as it was sold to me new, I took it out of the box, oohed and ahhed, and am now selling it to you. Comes with two sets of feet for different angles, 4 and 9 degrees, mini-USB PCB, and all necessary hardware. PCB tested, works. **Asking $375 shipped CONUS**

**Next is the GH60.** Wooden case made by the legendary /u/lxkhn during one of this groupbuy shindigs. One of the inserts has pulled out but doesn't effect the security as there are 5 others. The insert and screw in question are both included, along with the rest of the hardware. 

As for the PCB itself, it is mini-USB (pairs nicely with the cable listed below) with mill-max sockets for that sweet hotswap-ability. Stabilizers included (GMK Screw-in). Apparently one of the screws off the spacebar stabilizer was lost at some point, but doesn't seem to make a difference, as I never noticed, just mentioning for full transparency. 

Also included is a silver aluminum plate and a nice piece of mk-ultra case foam to dampen the noise from the case a bit. Easily removable if you end up not wanting it, just slips in under the PCB. This keyboard is ready and raring to go, perfect starter board, just add switches (and cable) and fire away. **Asking $100 shipped CONUS**

**I also have an extra coiled mini-USB cable** lying around that I had previously matched with DSA Borealis before I sold it on. **Asking $18 shipped CONUS, or $10 with a keyboard**

My last artisan that hasn't found a home yet since I got out of the game is a CYSM Booo, in the Stupid Dog! colourway. Give this dumb dog a home. **Asking $80 shipped CONUS**

**Lastly is a set of blank, white, DSA caps** I picked up to fill in my DSA Milkshake set on a larger board. Don't really use them anymore, so moving them along. See album for exact amount and sizes. **Asking $8 with a board, as I'm not keen on shipping these by themselves...**

Thanks for reading this far, if you're still here, and please **comment before PMing**, prefer CONUS but will consider international if I have to.","[US-VA] [H] Southpaw 65% LHNP, GH60 w/ Wooden Case, Cable, CYSM Booo [W] Verified Paypal"

In great condition, but full disclosure, any imperfections in the case were mostly cleaned up with this [video's methods.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBNnZ3moZcM)

- Brass plate  
- Dawn60 PCB
- NovelKeys Creams w/ 205g0
- GMK Stabilizers (retooled) w/ Durock stems

Additional information:

- The plate is a version that is only compatible with GMK stabilizers. An updated version of the plate file exists, but I just never got around to a plate being made.
- The pcb can disconnect if it draws too much power (max brightness)  
- Edit: Does not come with keycaps

Solarized Dark - Used for a little more than a month, extremely slight shine on few alphas if any at all.

Nines - R2, essentially brand new, only mounted once for a few minutes and taken off.

Ideally, I'd like a 1:1 trade for Nines, or I could provide PayPal with Solarized Dark. We'd both be responsible for our own shipping.

It has Idea23 HiPro caps, sliders lubed with 3204, silence-x rings, comes with original box, stock caps, and a few extras from the original seller.  **note**: The Idea23 hiPro caps are pretty yellowed, the board was trapped in my office during COVID.  Also, the left and right shift have a cracked stem.  This was from the original owner. He said he wouldn't remove the caps unless you really needed to, as they might not go back on.  I never needed to remove them, nor have I noticed any ill side-effects from the cracked stems.  If he didn't tell me, I would have never known.~~|~~$215 shipped~~ SOLD for  asking.

Tossing in the cable, new stock keycaps, extra cherry stabs, and extra LEDs for free

Hi r/mechmarket! Its been a while.

I recently found out I'm being permanently laid off in November. I'm selling these boards to help bolster my savings while I look for a new job.

Prices are in USD. Prices include shipping to Canada and CONUS. Not FCFS, priority is given to Canadian buyers due to shipping times. Not looking to split at this time.

· Case Foam – KBDFans foam between case and PCB

· DZ60 Rev 3.0 PCB with Underglow RGB (doesn’t show in TOFU case) – Mill maxed except for escape key(escape pin hole for one pin is smaller and millmax socket did not fit, so this one switch is soldered in, you can still hot swap the rest of the keys)

o Alphas

o Novelties

o Non-Standard

o TKL

· Case comes with original KBD Box and keys in baggies

**Details:**

I exclusively use MDPC-X PET sleeving, and techflex where applicable. I generally use gold plated connectors, high-quality, US-made 28awg USB wire, and text-less 3:1 ratio heatshrink.

Each cable is meticulously hand-crafted, using what I consider to be the highest quality materials. I use precise workflows that are constantly being honed for better, more consistent results. I will not sell a cable that I am not happy with. I aim for S-stock, and will downgrade a cable to B-stock if I'm not satisfied with the quality.

I oven bake my coils and reverse them. This results in a tight, sturdy coil. They are springy yet stiff, and are meant for straight and level desk placements. I do not recommend arching the coils, and will not replace cables that have been mishandled. While I believe these will stand the test of time, the longest lasting coil is one that moves as little as possible.

Each cable is tested using a v1 **Drop CTRL** keyboard set to full brightness solid colors. This is a notoriously power hungry RGB filled board, and is the only one I have on hand. I have not had a single cable fail or dim noticeably. I **cannot** guarantee that your high power draw board will function with the longer cables, but my results are positive. If you are concerned, I can shorten the host cable for a small fee.

**Common Questions:**

**Q: Why don't you use paracord?**

A: MDPC-X is the gold standard of sleeving material, in my humble opinion. I just dont like the physical properties of paracord, and prefer using PET based sleeving. As such, I do not offer ANY paracord options. In the end, it's just my preference.

**Q: Why are your prices more expensive than other sellers?**

A: I am a small-time cable maker who works in limited batches to produce the highest quality cables I can. My materials, skillset, time, and strict quality control lead to higher than average prices. I believe my quality will speak for itself. I also have some health problems that will always limit my production capabilities.  Prices are determined on a cable by cable basis, and will vary by options. Length, aviator type, and multi-tones all affect pricing.

**Q: Do offer free shipping? Where do you ship to?**

A: It's simply not economical for a low-volume maker like myself to offer free shipping. The shipping cost will about $10 for ConUS. International shipping is offered, but all import/shipping costs are assumed by the buyer.

**Q: How are your packages packed?**

A: I ship using 12x12x2 in boxes. I use 6+ sq.ft of bubble padding throughout the package. The connectors are all wrapped with lil' bubble wrap socks for protection. Please be gentle and careful when removing the bubble wrap from the four ends of your cables. Try to undo the tape rather than cutting or pulling it off.  This is all for the goal of delivering your cable in perfect condition.

Each coil (unless you opt out) ships with a custom-length section of PETG tubing. This is primarily to prevent the coil from arching during transit, but I recommend leaving it inside the coil during use. It can be used to keep your coil as straight and even as possible. This isnt strictly necessary, but it's something I like to provide. If you do remove it, be sure to keep the tube for safe travel in the future. The host cable is secured with a reusable silicon/wire cable wrap. (No zip or velcro ties)

Also, stickers!

**Sale Details:**

Paypal. Currency is USD. Shipping will be determined at time of invoice. $10 shipping in ConUS.

Packages are packed after they are sold, so please allow a maximum of 48 hours before shipment. I aim to ship asap. Tracking info will be provided through PayPal/USPS. Please keep in mind that I do not offer free shipping. Packages will ship from San Jose, CA.

These cables are not toys, and are intended to be treated with a gentle touch. Do not pull sharply, bend excessively, hold vertically at one end, or do anything that would contrast with common sense. Do not attempt to undo any connectors. I will not replace any cables that show signs of mishandling.

Reminder that while I have tested these cables using a high power RGB keyboard, your mileage may vary, based on things like the power output of your motherboards USB ports, and things that I cannot account for.

Different cable makers use different wire orders. Do not attempt to mix and match a VoxelMods coil or host cable with another maker's work.  Damage may occur, and I am not liable for such.

**Personal Background:**

VoxelMods is now a full-time operations! Im a visual effects artist by training, and have spent the last 5 years doing 3D modeling and project management for high-end home furnishings companies. I have been modding and watercooling PCs since 2017, and used to make full custom PC sleeved cables before moving to keebs. I'm happily married to the love of my life and best friend. My wife assists me behind the scenes by sleeving cables and helping with colorways. We have two leopard geckos and a bearded dragon! I am also a teacher who loves learning and sharing knowledge and techniques. My favorite color is purple, and I have long been engaged in the ""Pursuit of Purple"". Purple all the things please!

Will throw in an fr4 plate as well but the layout isn't compatible with the pcb. (will include some extra mill-max sockets so you can fix this. pcb has regular caps lock but fr4 is forced stepped).

I have a Fusion60 in hhkb layout with extra carbon fiber half plate, and a brass plate as well. Comes with the stock pcb soldered with outemu silent clear sky(clear top and sky bottom) lubbed with 3203 and they have u4 stems. I bought them switches from Daily Clack and ended up being super expensive due to 20 euro shipping and then 40 euros on customs fees. Recently, I found that if I bought it from Aliexpress the stem would be the same as u4 I think. Dumb me 😢

&#x200B;

The stabilizers in the board are the durock clears.

&#x200B;

The solder job could be better ~~and it will need re-centering on 3 or 4 switches of the bottom row~~. The switches are very good tactiles and the board is amazing, but I find the typing angle uncomfortable for me, and maybe the fact that I put SA keycap didn't help as well.

* Similar 65% keyboards (preferably gasket mount)
* GMK sets (new, light use)

Might want to buy those items if you're not interested in the fusion60.

Edit: The switches are now aligned. There was one problem though, which was one of the pads was not in a great shape and lift up, so I had to add a new jump wire. There are 2 in total, which makes the pcb in a not so great overall condition. The price is adjusted a little bit as well. The board is compatible with most standard 60% pcb in tsangan layout, so it could be replaced by a dz60 without a problem or a hs60 hhkb, cannonkeys instant 60 for example.

SOLD

Hi guys, I’ve got a black savage65 built with nk_ blueberry switches and gmk stabs that have been lubed with 205g0 by the original owner. Layout uses a 7u spacebar. Haven’t used it as much as I hoped and would like to go back to having a TKL. Prefer trading it + PayPal for a built WHITE kbd8x MKII but if I can’t find a trade would be willing to part for $400 shipped.

Also purchased GMK 8008 with the deskmat here for this board, both were brand new when I got them. No shine, used minimally, few hours collectively. Deskmat does have some minor stains though near the bottom, refer to time stamp but not really noticeable. Can ship with original box, prefer not to part. Also available to trade but open to selling as well for $340 if no trades available.

Everything bundled $720 shipped. SOLD

Shipping to CONUS only. Please comment before PMing, thanks!","[US-ME] [H] Savage65, GMK 8008 Base + Deskmat [W] Built White KBD8X MKII, Macropad with Rotary"

Have some extra POM plates for the kbd67v2 mkii. Plate doesn't have cut off for standoffs and is made using the files for the solderable PCB. That said you can use it for the hotswap variant as well but it's easier to do with setting up the plate/switches/keycap assembly completely and then mounting it on the board. 
Asking 35 GBP shipped: Sold x2

Finally.. ordered way too much of an acoustic sound dampening material. It's 2mm thick, should fit a few cases. It's graded to isolate 26dB with a single layer. It's quite dense and will legitimately add weight to your build as it's reasonably heavy for its size. 
Let me know if there's interest and what size you want for pricing. A rough 60 percent cut out for about 25 GBP shipped.

Hey y'all,

Just received my dream keyboard yesterday, and realized that I don't have much room/use for two 75% keyboards. The board was imported from Korea and here are the details:

* Aluminum plate
* Paco switches (cream housings with halo stems). Used black gateron ink v2 springs. Recently lubed with Tribosys 3203
* GMK Stabs (unsure of the lube used by previous owner)

Hi mechmarket, I'm selling my acrylic Alice clone from Switch Couture. The board is all black, with a transparent bottom for LED underglow. The build is as follows:

* Project Keyboard Alice PCB R3 (purple)
* 67g Zealio v2, filmed and lubed with krytox 205g0
* Zeal gold-plated stabs, lubed with dielectric grease (light)

The board includes the acrylic wrist rest, a custom oversized carrying case made by my girlfriend, as well as an extra black bottom if you aren't interested in underglow.

Looking to get $360 USD + shipping. I would also be interested in possibly trading the board (no KBDFans) but do not have a list of boards that I'm looking for.

Keycaps are obviously not included, but I'd be willing to bundle them for $480 USD. They are GMK Hyperfuse Origins R2 and have medium shine.","[CA-BC] [H] Switch Couture ""Malice"" + Extras [W] Paypal, Trades"

**Realforce R2 TKL $220 shipped? dunno how to price this one**

This is a Realforce R2 TKL with variable weight domes and Hangul sub-legend caps from a very old Realforce 86uk. The keyboard is lubed with Tribosys 3204, but the stabilizers will need some relubing as there is rattle present. There are two main flaws with this board: there is some shine on the alphas which are the Korean ones that I harvested. The other flaw is a dent on the back of the keyboard. [Here’s are photos of the flaws I mentioned](https://imgur.com/a/6JTHFTs)

## Imaginary questions and answers

## Wow! That’s a lot of cool stuff! Are you operating a store or business?

~~Thank you! :) - No, I’m not operating a store or business. And I’m not trying to profit from selling keyboards / keyboard parts. I’ve been an enthusiastic keyboard collector for the past few years. I’ve learned a lot, met many cool people, and had fun doing it. But circumstances have changed and it makes sense for me to sell as much of my collection as I can as a result :(~~

## Over 9000 Euros!! Are you crazy!? How did you come up with those prices?

~~Sorry!! I put a lot of work into pricing my items. But I probably made some mistakes along the way too. I looked at what I paid, including shipping and import fees, and added or removed a little from the top. I think that will work well for rare / group buy items. But it might not make sense for international buyers, stocked items, and items that I bought second hand. If you want something that I’m selling and you think that it’s overpriced then you’re welcome to make me an offer. Otherwise, keep an eye out, and I’ll lower the prices of things that don’t sell over time. I don’t want anybody, including me, to be a sucker.~~

## Will you sell GMK keycap set kits that are listed together separately?

~~Maybe… If I listed them together then they might be in the same bag in my closet. If you want to buy one and not the other(s) then I may separate them for you. But I probably won’t prefer your offer if somebody else offers to buy both. And it might take me a couple days to get around to separating them.~~

I’m selling my Rama U80-A, Kuro (Black), Hotswap which finally arrived from Rama’s Melbourne warehouse. I have a U80-A Starter Kit also included in the package.

It’s brand new, perfect condition, opened minimally only to take photos (see link). Nothing more. With the current situation now I’m unable to get into this passion project. I was planning to combine with my GMK Mizu (that I’ll sell later), which could make a nice combo I think. But well, another time!

I will send from Australia, internationally is fine.

Australia: $1000 USD.
USA: $1075 USD. (Express tracked postage).
Europe: I’ll need to check. (PM me, but you’d suffer the Europe VAT import duty most likely)

Looking to offload some stuff because I am no longer using it or need it. Mostly stuff I bought when I got into the hobby. 

&#x200B;

KBDFans Space Grey Anode with 5lb weight - $200 + shipping

* My first build, used for around 2 months. 
* DZ60 Rev3 - soldered. QMK firmware.
* Lubed NK Creams with 205g0, springs with 205g0.
* PC plate
* GMK screw in stabs lubed with 205g0
* Build layout is split backspace, split right shift. 

&#x200B;

GMK Vice Nights - $160 + shipping SOLD

* Bought from Originative for $180 so I could have a proper GMK set, discounting because of the E scuff mentioned below. Minimal shine.
* Comes with base, spacebar, and alternative set.
* E is scuffed from a bad ring shaped keycap puller I bought, pictures [here](https://imgur.com/a/gZhHKt2). 
* Can be shipped in bags or trays.

&#x200B;

NK BoW $55 + shipping SOLD

* Just bought it off here, mounted once and I didn't like the legends.
* Can be shipped in bags or trays. 

&#x200B;

JTK Toxic - $40 + shipping SOLD

* This was my first ever keycap set, used for a couple months. Bought secondhand off MM for $50. 
* I never realized it until later, but it is missing a majority of the num pad numbers as well as some TKL keys. Which now makes sense why it was so cheap. 
* Comes with both 7u and 6.25u spacebars and covers a 60% no problem. Also has JTK novelties.
* Only has bags for shipping.

&#x200B;

Atlantis Kraken Mat - $45 OBO + shipping SOLD

* Bought this in the GB thinking I would use it, but it doesn't match my keyboard or keycap sets.

I have some lubed switches, all lubed with 205g0 and are brand new.

~~80x Alpacas - $110 shipped~~

* ~~Lubed with 205g0, filmed with Deskeys films~~
* ~~For a cheaper version, you can just buy the silks I'm selling.~~ sold to u/Dorthyboy

70x Creams - 90 shipped

* lubed with 205g0, can film or include films although this has no effect in my experience. I stock deskeys films and have a small amount of TX films.

~~70x Yellow Silks - 65 shipped~~

* ~~Selling these because I prefer a heavier layer of lube and they also feel light for some reason, not too sure.~~
* ~~They are manufactured by JWK and I don't think they need films (I tried, didn't really make a difference).~~ sold to u/BlueNinja27

I am also looking for GMK and KAT sets, specifically GMK Bingsu and KAT Specimen (I think this is close to shipping, not too sure if they have though).

Hey r/mm, I have a few items today for sale/trade.

1. ~~**60% case**~~: This is your run off the mill 60% low profile aluminum case, in grey. I bought this from a user [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/hc6m4r/caon_h_kbdfans_lp_aluminium_case_60_1up_rgb_60/) and never used it, and the original owner used it briefly to test switches. Comes with feet to angle the case and the necessary hardware. Looking for ~~$60~~  $45 OBO shipped. **SOLD**
2. **Planck Rev 4:**  This was my first build and solder job, so even though the PCB underside looks somewhat like dogshit, the board functions great. Built with Gateron greens and Kailh box whites on the modifiers and has case foam beneath the PCB. Used for about 2 months, I am looking for ~~$90~~ $80 OBO shipped or a 5-row ortho.
3. ~~**SA Ice Cap set**~~: All keys shown in time stamp. Barely used by me because I realized I dislike uniform R3. Bought them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/hh1o86/usny_h_kbdfans_s60_w_dz60rgb_hotswap_pcb_black/). I am looking to trade for below profiles or ~~$70~~ $60 shipped.**SOLD**
4. **SA Pulse:** Spacebar and some of the alphas are shined. More pictures of them mounted [here](https://imgur.com/a/bfhPEa5). Looking to sell for ~~$120~~ $100 shipped, or trading for the below sets.

I am hoping to get trade offers for the keycap sets and will wait until my lunch break tomorrow (Tuesday, August 4th) to sell for PayPal to the first person that inquires. I am looking for:

\- KAT, GMK, SA, or ePBT sets,

and can bundle any of the above items or trade with PayPal on either end.

I can also bundle items for a discount if you so choose you want multiple things. Thank you for looking!

Hi all,

I have a Rama U80-a hotswap in Moon for sale.  Kit includes all original accessories/parts/packaging plus internal dampener.

This thing is a tank and has the most premium feel/finish I've yet to see on a board.  The anodizing on case and finish on weight is immaculate.  No scuffs, scratches, marks or blemishes that I can find on outside of case.

Disclaimers:  It has been assembled and used for a short period of time.  Removal of switches caused some tiny scratches on the mirror finished plate.  Only other issue is 1 of the tiny screws holding plate to mute pins will not tighten all the way - presumably because screw hole was drilled just a hair too deep on plate. This does not affect anything when built and can be made tight by using a small stabilizer gasket.

\*\*\*Kit ships as it was shipped to me from Rama. Does not include switches or stabilizers.  Can add a set of lubed GMK stabs if requested.\*\*\*

**~~$1200 shipped~~**

* [TIMESTAMP FOR MX BLACKS](https://imgur.com/4KJagwn)

These are MX1A-11NW-1 Retooled Blacks made in 2018.  They have been lubed with Krytox 205g0, and filmed with clear TX Films, and using 70g TX springs.  

These are the same switches from my Jane V2 [Sound test 1 with ABS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwat1B_nC2c) and [sound test 2 with PBT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxDAXMjiXyY).  


#~~Looking to sell switches  for **$90 shipped in CONUS**~~ SOLD

* [TIMESTAMP FOR BSP RED ON BEIGE](https://imgur.com/sUicbdi)  

These are the same set from originativeco.com, but do not have spacebars (BSP never made spacebars).  My set comes with GMK spacebars (color matches)
These are very similar to original Cherry PBT.  It's slightly better quality than epbt, except for the warped 2.75x right shift.  All BSP sets have this ""banana shift"".  Set will fit a WKL ANSI TKL and 7u TKL.  *Note these are notorious for scratching against the top housing of switches, especially if they are stickered or filmed. YMMV*

This is a black Realforce R2 TKL with variable weight domes and Hangul sub-legend caps from a very old Realforce 86uk. The keyboard is lubed with Tribosys 3204, but the stabilizers will need some relubing as there is rattle present. There is one main flaw with this board: a dent on the back of the keyboard.

Hey Hey everyone!

Before I list what I have, I'm looking for...... a blue-gray WKL CA66, a m60-a in lake, GMK Grisean, a Satisfaction 75 plate (brass/FR4/etc.), and lubed/filmed alpacas to buy/trade for. Please PM if you have and want to deal.

Lets get to the goodies :)

&#x200B;

**~~HB85~~** ~~- red base with black insert. Case is in great condition with no dings. Will come with 2 builds as well as an extra never used pcb. Build 1 - 62g lubed v1 Zilents with 3204 on a full red plate. These are incredibly smooth. Build 2 - 67g v1 Zealios lubed with 3204 on a red half plate. Excellent sound with this case. This is a pretty rare board and even more rare colorway. $1000 or Trades~~

**~~GMK Miami Nights~~** ~~- amazing set. Looks so good in person. 7u spacebar has shine spot on it but the rest of the set looks pretty good to my eye. I’ll play it safe though and just say there is some possible shine starting on a couple alphas. $260 or trades for other keyset~~

**~~GMK Laser~~** ~~- you’ve seen it, it’s cool :) some shine is beginning on a few alphas but rest looks and feels pretty good. PSA: This set is available on Drop I believe until tomorrow if you’d prefer to get it there. It’s probably cheaper there as well if you don’t mind waiting a few (possibly many) months for it to be delivered. $165 or trades for other keyset~~

**~~H1 switches~~** ~~- 120x stock. $100 or trade for alpacas~~

**Silk Series switches** \- 120x stock yellow spring variety. $100 or trade for alpacas

**~~Springs~~** ~~- These are packages of roughly 110x springs each. I'm looking to sell all of them as a large bundle. 2x 63.5g, 2x 65g, 1x 67g, 1x 68g, 1x 78g. Close to 800 springs total in the bundle. $40~~

|60x Gateron Black Inks|These have been lubed with Krytox 205g0 and filmed with red TX Films. They have been desoldered and they are pretty average looking. DISCLAIMER- Whoever must have owned these switches before the person i bought they from must have really not known how to take switches out of a plate. The majority of the clips that hold the switch onto the plate are broken off, so whenever you try to remove keycaps off of the switch on a hotswap board, the switch will come out with the keycap. If you were planning to solder them, this shouldn't be a problem, only if you were going to use them in a hotswap build.|$40 shipped|Available|
|~~30x YOK Holy Polar Pandas~~|~~These have been lubed with Trybosis 3203 and they have been desoldered. This was my first attempt at desoldering a PCB and im guessing whoever soldered the board did not use correct solder because these little fuckers were very stubborn to get out and they really did not come out that clean. I have since desoldered a board that i built and used the same equipment to desolder as these Pandas and it went way smoother than it went with these.~~|~~$30 shipped~~|Sold for asking|","[US-KY] [H] Grey Tofu 65, MAXKEY Foundation, GMK Analog Dreams, 67g Tangerines, Tealios, Gateron Yellows, Black Inks, Polar Pandas [W] Paypal"

Only difference is the sound profile. Top + bottom housing, stem, and spring lubricated with 205g0. Filmed with TX White Films. The buttery smoothness is present in both. FFF is a lot more lighting friendly thanks to the smokey-transparent housing.~~|~~$95 Shipped to CON-US~~|~~$90 + Shipping Internationally~~

Hi all,

Looking to sell my artisans since I simply never use them. Also open to a trade for a GMK Keycap set. For a trade I value the artisans lower. Mostly interested in neutral colored sets, pm me what you got.

I'll repeat, €200 / $250 for all!

* Prices include pp fees, do **not** include shipping
* Highly prefer to sell within EU but for the bundle I will consider international shipping. Due to the bundle priced to go, shipping internationally is on you
* Artisans are hand-made and therefore none of them are perfect
* Dollar is low at the moment, sorry US buyers, nothing I can do about that :(

I'm open to trade them for a keycap set. Interested in GMK only. Oblivion, Shoko, Burgundy, Denim. Anything grey/black/beige. I like boring colored sets :P

Please reply here and send a PM after, no chatting MSN was popular in the 90's but not anymore.

Thanks for looking!

I have too many keycaps and my wife is threatening to leave me (only half of that is true, you can guess which).

Anyway, I’ve got a bunch of stuff for sale. Not in a huge hurry to let it go and I’ll be prioritizing bundles so I have to make less trips to the shipping store. I'll ship USPS CONUS for the included price, if you'd like something different, I can get a quote.

Please comment before you PM and I prefer PMs to Chats. If you’d like to split up a set, please PM what kits you’re interested in and I'll see if I can matchmake.

Prices do not include shipping. PM me with your location and I can check shipping rates (DE \~3-6€, EU \~9-15€, USA \~60$, so probably out of question). Not FCFS. Interest in trades with GMK WoB/BoW extension kits.

PM (comment before, don't use chat) if you're interested or have questions/need more photos.

Thanks for stopping by!","[EU-DE] [H] GMMK Compact Barebone ISO, Gingham, Turquoise Tealios, BM16A (hot-swap), YMDK NP21, White/Black OEM ISO blank keycaps, Desoldering pump [W] GMK WoB/BoW Icon Extension Kit, GMK WoB Extension R0/R5, Paypal"
