Good evening MM!

Sadly, it is time to thin the collection. I have a couple of boards, some keycaps, and a couple of other items that I need to let go of. The condition of the items vary. Please see below.

**Just doing CONUS (AK/HI) right now. May open up to international if they don’t sell.  Prices don't include shipping (usually ranges between $10-$15, depending on area).**

**Keyboards:**

***~~SOLD~~*** **~~Purple Alu Tofu60: $75~~** ***~~SOLD~~***

~~- Comes with GMK screw in stabs (clipped, lubed, and band-aid modded by previous owner)~~

~~- Brass Plate~~

~~- KBDFans Foam between case and PCB~~

~~- DZ60 Rev 3.0 PCB with underglow RGB - PCB is millmaxed except for escape key, which is soldered with a stock NK Blueberry~~

~~- No switches or keycaps~~

~~- Still in very good condition~~

***~~SOLD~~*** **~~Leopold FC660C 65% 45g: $100~~** ***~~SOLD~~***

~~- Bought this from~~ [~~MechanicalKeyboards.com~~](https://MechanicalKeyboards.com)~~. It was a used unit. I have a Realforce 87u and I just don't use this at all. Looks practically brand new.~~

***~~SOLD~~*** **~~IBM Model M (Mfg 1986): $75~~** ***~~SOLD~~***

~~\- Model M in all its buckling spring glory. Bought this from another member on MM. I bought an SSK and I just don't need this guy. If I remember correctly he bolt-modded it (I never opened to confirm). It has a medal badge. Has some minor scratches and dings, not too bad for a 35 year old board.~~

***~~SOLD~~*** **~~Dygma Raise: $100~~** ***~~SOLD~~***

~~\- If you've never heard of this board, you can check it out [here](https://dygma.com/products/dygma-raise). Overall, it's a cool board, but I just don't have a use for it. I prefer my Alice style boards. I have the original keycaps but it doesn't have switches (its hot-swappable). Comes with carrying case and the required ""bits"".~~

**Keycaps:**

***~~SOLD~~*** **~~Maxkey SA Maiami/$30~~** ***SOLD~~*** *** ~~\- Little to no shine. It might actually be missing some of the novelty keys, but it has all the important ones.~~

***~~SOLD~~*** **~~ePBT Blumen/$30~~** ***~~SOLD~~*** **~~-~~** ~~Little to no shine. Bought it off of MM. Never actually mounted them.~~

***~~SOLD~~*** **~~Novelkeys ePBT Vaporwave/$20~~** ***~~SOLD~~*** \*\*~~-~~\*\*\~\~Substantial shine. Guy I bought it from on MM daily drove them. Never actually mounted them.

**Misc:**

***~~SOLD~~*** **~~72-Switch Tester/$20~~** ***~~SOLD~~***~~\*\*:\*\* Bought from KBDFANS when I first entered the hobby. Now I know what I like so I don't need this anymore.~~

***~~SOLD~~*** **~~Novelkeys Leviathan Runes Deskmat/$30~~** ***~~SOLD~~***~~\*\*:\*\* I have Taeha levels of deskmats so I need to offload some (some, as in one).~~

**As always, comment before you PM. I will try to respond as quickly as possible. Thanks!**"

Hello keeb friends,

I am once again asking you fine folk to acquire my wares.

Not FCFS, priority goes to bundles. Prices include Paypal fees + shipping, as well as prices for local cash. **CONUS shipping only** and also open to local cash offers if you're around the Bay Area (around 94403). Please comment before shooting me a pm, and I won't respond to chat as I have that disabled.

I am also searching for a Bear65 Hotswap PCB. Feel free to pm me an offer (plus a timestamp would be much appreciated). Otherwise, have a good rest of your week :)

Howdy Mechmarket, got a couple of artisans to sell. The Moses and First Love artisans were both mounted once and taken off, the other two were only taken out of their bag to inspect. Decided to sell these since I realized artisans aren't really for me and I'm in need of some money so letting these go. All lividity caps will be shipped with their respective info tag.

As usual please comment then pm using the link provided by the bot below, thank you!

I am able to do local pickup in OC/LA area (my zip is 92805)

Please write a comment below and then send me a pm. Please do not use Reddit chat―I won't reply.

Shipping is not included in the prices below but is typically $15-20 to CONUS or Canadian locations. International tracked shipping has been kind of crazy lately, but I'm happy to calculate a price for you if you're interested!

Prices listed are in USD. Sale is not necessarily FCFS.

**PC Think 6.5 V1**. Hotswap PCB, brass weight and badge. Looks fantastic with or without RGB. I've buffed out a few little scuffs from use, disassembled and fully cleaned it, and it looks practically new. Ships in original box. Includes necessary allen keys for disassembly. $600.

**GMK QMX Silencing clips**. 110 clips, never used. $30.

**Artisans:**

Prices are OBO, and I am open to trade offers. Closeup pics are available in the timestamp album, and I can provide more or butt shots on request.

The top case is flawless but the bottom has two light scratches. Comes with a hotswap PCB and FR4 plate as well as the carrying case and all foams. Price lowered from my last post.|$835|
|[Rama M60-A Olivia Edition - Hotswap w/ Internal Dampener](https://imgur.com/a/SZP7HF6)|Beautiful board with a heavy PVD rose gold brass weight, in overall great condition. The back weight has some signs of use, but nothing too bad. Also includes the extra internal silicone dampener. Comes with the original Rama box and all accessories. I'm also open to trading for a Rukia, Tengu, Kei, or similar-valued Alice or 60/65% boards. Price lowered from my last post.|$690/ Trades for Rukia, Tengu, Kei or other similar-valued Alices or 60/65% boards|
|[Think6.5 v2 Deep Ocean 2u w/ Hotswap PCB & Extra Teal Badge](https://imgur.com/a/JE6vJDF)|The board is in mint condition, gaskets were installed on the case. The PCB is 7305 mill-max hotswapped to support both 6.25u and 7u bottom rows as well as stepped caps lock. I was looking forever to trade for this board so I can pair it with GMK Hammerhead, but the shipping date is so far away so I can't justify keeping this. Comes with an extra teal nautical badge as well as the original black lightbulb badge, and all original accessories.|$750|
|[Alpine65 Red w/ Extras](https://imgur.com/a/XEBRedV)|Hotswap kit with FR4 and POM plates. Flawless condition. It's an amazing board with a clean, clacky sound and hefty weight. The red looks very vibrant for ano compared to my previous red boards and it was the most limited color option as well in terms of units. Soft gaskets were installed on the bottom and hard gaskets on top case, includes extra gaskets, both foams, and the original carrying case. I'm also open to trading for a Kei in any color.

&#x200B;

The 7V is a really nice board, but I'm hoping to trade for a Jelly Epoch in SE color. Will consider selling straight up for the right price, but greatly prefer to trade at this point.

The board comes with 7305 mill maxed PCB so it's hotswap ready. Also has 2 PC plates and a white FR4 plate.

Overall in flawless condition aside from some micro scratches on the bottom weight and finger prints on the PCB. The video in the timestamp album gives an idea of how hard it is to see the scratches. If you look at just the right angle they're pretty visible, but how often do we really look at the bottom of our keyboards. Should be easy to buff out with a little polish and polishing pad.

&#x200B;

Please leave a comment and send PM.

**HAVE:**

**Monstargear K80 PC (Hotswap)** \- Used for about two weeks, the condition is pretty much perfect except for a scratch on the weight on the back (you can see this in pics). It will only include the things listed in the timestamp, if you want it shipped in OG box the shipping cost might be a bit more than expected because it's huge lol.  **300$** **+ shipping.**

**GMK Metropolis** \- Used, light shine on alpha keys and one of the spacebars out of the bunch. They will come in the bag as you see in the picture. **300$ shipped**

**WANT:**

As for trades, I'm open to anything really. Looking for keycaps mainly but if you want to take both things for a board I'm into TKLs primarily. Would like **GMK DMG** but again I'm open to a lot so just make a fair offer.

Hey everyone! Made some great financial decisions recently lmao so have to sell some things. Listed this about a month ago but my friend ended up not going through with the trade. Comes with the following extras (not splitting):

* Build 1: [Sound Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUaKlCGpubA)
   * Plate: PC Full
   * Switches: Box Jades on Alphas, Box Navies elsewhere
   * Film: None
   * Stabilizers: GMK Screw-In with CK Wires (XHT-BDZ)

\*\*Note: PCB in working but not great condition for this build (couple jumped pads, I'm basically including this build for free).

* Build 2: [Sound Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKDRv_TSTQA)
   * Plate: Brass Full
   * Switches:  Cherry Hyperglide Reds (16mm 67g TX Springs, 205g0). 80g spring on modifiers. 105g0 on springs.
   * Film: Deskeys
   * Stabilizers: Zeal Stabs on 2u modifiers, GMK Screw-In on spacebar (XHT-BDZ).
* Extra POM Plate
* Extra FR4 Plate
* Extra Aluminum Plate
* 20A and 60A O Rings
* CannonKeys Large Carrying Case + Extra Microfiber Cloth
* Mode Eighty Solderable Case Foam (trimmed a little to fit the case)
* KBDFans Torx Bit and extra screws
* I have some Gat Giants laying around as well, let me know if you want to include that with the board for free.

Really looking to get this out of the door as soon as possible. The total cost for me with all of the extras and builds came out to at least $700, so selling at a significant loss.

Selling my M-65A. I've since gotten out of using 65% boards so I'm looking to sell this to someone that will actually use it. I purchased it from the original owner about three years ago.

There is a small mark on the top surface of the board (see last photo) and some micro-scratches on the plate/weight. Any scratches on the plate can't be seen with keycaps installed anyway. I could not find any other imperfections in my review of the board.

If you aren't interested in the zealios that I have installed, I do have a Hakko desolder gun that I could use to disassemble the board and sell it without switches. Price could be negotiated for this if interested.

Looking to sell everything as one bundle at this time.

**Details of the current build:**

* M-65A by RAMA from Keyclack GB
* Space Grey alu top
* Nylon base
* Polished Brass plate/weight
* QMK native compatible PCB with a v32u4 currently in the build
* 78g Zealios V2
* GMK stabs. Clipped/lubed with dielectric grease/band-aided

**Details of the extra PCBs:**

* (1) unused QMK native compatible PCB with a v32u4.
* (1) unused BMC native compatible PCB with a v32a. As I recall, these can be flashed to run QMK instead but I found the QMK native PCB worked much better when I last messed with this.
* (1) DOA BMC native compatible PCB with a v32a. This one arrived DOA when I first purchased this board and I could never figure out the problem. Consider it usable for spare SMD components.

~~Looking for~~ *~~$550 shipped~~*~~. CONUS Verified Paypal only.~~  Sold to u/Tyson522 for $500 without zealios.

Willing to ship international but buyer would have to pay for the increase in shipping fees. Not interested in any trades.

Hello keeb friends,

I am once again asking you fine folk to acquire my wares.

Not FCFS, priority goes to bundles. Prices include Paypal fees + shipping, as well as prices for local cash. **CONUS shipping only** and also open to local cash offers if you're around the Bay Area (around 94403). Please comment before shooting me a pm, and I won't respond to chat as I have that disabled.

I am also in search for GMK Alter Base Kit. BNIB or used is fine, just can't be shined out of its mind. Otherwise, have a pleasant rest of your week :)

|[Infinikey WoB (Latin Alphas, Hiragana Alphas, Icon Mods)](https://imgur.com/a/gng1Ssp)|Traded secondhand with minimal use, none to very light shine if any. Mounted the hiragana alphas and icon mods on a HHKB, then taken off immediately after 30 min.  Too many keycaps coming in so getting rid of this set sadly. Also CRP gang for life. Can ship in bags for cheaper. EDIT: Selling the kits as a whole bundle, won't respond to PMs asking to separate|$230 Shipped / $200 Local|
|[GMK Ashes Ghost Kit](https://imgur.com/a/8dwVYxS)|Bought this sealed from another user. Unsealed it and mounted the alphas, decided I liked the darker alphas much more.  Can ship in bag for cheaper|$130 Shipped / $110 Local|
|[RAMA x ePBT Kuro/Shiro White Artisan Keycap](https://imgur.com/a/IMlkdcR)|E-white aluminum with black enamel infill. Mounted on M6-C for about half a year, immaculate condition with no scratches or dents.|$100 Shipped / $90 Local|
|90 x Salmons|Stock, only 1 lubed with Tribosys 3203.  Only mounted the lubed switch on a hotswap build, decided to go with another tactile switch.|$45 Shipped / $35 Local|
|70 x Lavenders|Lubed (very lightly) with Krytox 205g0, spring oiled with 105, and Deskey filmed, courtesy of [Loobed Switches](https://loobedswitches.com/). Never used.|$95 Shipped / $85 Local|
|75 x Key Limes (Creamsicles with C3 Kiwi Housing)|Lubed with Krytox 205g0, spring oiled with 105, and KBDFans switch filmed (0.2mm foam). Same sound and feel as Tangerine housed Creamsicles, only difference is color.  Mounted on a hotswap build and was not feeling the 3.5mmish travel distance (felt like even less but not sure the exact number).|$130 Shipped / $110 Local|

Hey MM! I will be selling the GMK Mizu Base set, novelties, and spacebar set with the deskpad. This was mounted on a 60% board and used for about a week, NO SHINE at all though the texture does not have that BNIB feel on some of the alphas. The deskpad shows some signs of wear around the bottom left corner and the righthand side around the middle from a mouse. It is from the first run so the colors are accurate and it is machine washable.

 Prefer CONUS but if you are outside that don't be afraid to msg about it. Not FCFS. **Will be only sold as a bundle and will not split the kits**

Hey rMM. Got a few last things left from my old collection. Will discount on bundles. **CONUS Only.**

1.  Bakeneko60 (White) - Bought this from another user on mechmarket a little over a month ago. In that time, I have learned that this board just isn't for me. Not that it isn't good, it's just not my preference. Soldered with Creampacas from the previous owner. Comes with the hotswap PCB as well. Stabilizers are lubed. Paint condition is about a 7/10. There are scratches at the top row on the inside of the case due to the keycaps I had rubbing against it. Can't notice it with keycaps on. **Looking for $260 Shipped OBO.**

2. ~~Skyloong GK61 (Black, O-Ring Modded) - Referencing [this video here](https://youtu.be/BAih24YcsIY), this o-ring mod really levels up the sound of the GK61 in my opinion. Build has Feker Pandas (lubed with 3203, 105 on springs), and has thin foam at the bottom. Stabs were replaced for Cherry clones and are tuned with 205g0. Keycaps are a cheap DSA Carbon knockoff set. Comes with some extra switches & the white coiled cable (Asceny). **Looking for $110 Shipped OBO.**~~ **SOLD**

3. ~~GMK Laser (Cyberdeck) - Sealed, never opened. Ordered this during the GB when I planned to have more of a laser themed setup. That has since changed and now I do not want it. **Looking for $125 Shipped OBO. (I am also willing to ship this set in bags for $115 Shipped.)**~~ **SOLD**

4. ~~Gateron Red Inks, 65x (Lubed & Filmed) - 205g0 on stem and housing, 27 springs lubed with 205g0 and 38 lubed with 105 (done in two different batches.) Films are random. About half of the switches total are using clear & black TX films, the other half are clear durock films. **Looking for $48 Shipped OBO.**~~ **SOLD**

Hello all,

Looking to get rid of some of my stuff, prices are OBO and do not include shipping. CONUS shipping only unless you would like to pay for intl. shipping plus insurance. I have tried to include defects in the pictures but my camera is not the best. I can provide more pictures upon request! **Please pm me (no chats) with your zip code for a quote on shipping.**

&#x200B;

**E8.5 WK Black w/ PC Accent:** Board is built with Holy Mint Pandas that are L+F. Board is gasket mounted using the included gummy O-ring and has plate foam in between plate and pcb. Board is in perfect working condition, but I had to jump a pad during my build process. There is a small mark on the bottom right corner and a small mark on the plate where I had to remove a switch.

Also included is an extra un-opened pcb and O-ring

Price: 650 USD + Shipping OBO

&#x200B;

**~~Fjell Grey Case:~~** ~~Bought from another user on mm, I am not sure which round it is from but as you can see there is patina on the brass weight. Small mark that I have pictured but otherwise the case is in good condition.~~

# THE PITCH

~~Did you snag GMK Future Funk extras?  Are you looking for an e-white WKL keyboard?  Then do I have a deal for you!!  I'm looking to straight up trade a fully built Fox Labs F80SE keyboard complete with:~~

* ~~Lubed/Filmed Ghost switches (Silent linear switch)~~
* ~~plate foam/rubber~~
* ~~JTK stormtrooper caps (only the caps on the board)~~
* ~~Alu plate~~

~~No assembly required!  No separate keycaps to purchase!  Silent for in office use now that people are going back to work after being vaccinated!!  I invested $650 for the case, $130 for the switches (bought as lubed/filmed), and $60 for the caps - a total value of $840!! This all before fixing the lube amount on the switches to my preference and soldering the board!  AMAZING!  I'm prepared to trade the entire board for the following GMK Future Funk kits:~~

* ~~Base~~
* ~~Hiragana~~
* ~~Light alphas~~
* ~~Icon mods~~
* ~~spacebars~~
* ~~40s kit~~

~~That's right: all the things!!  At TKC extras prices, this amounts to a monetary retail value of $575 (at flip prices it's....more than that).  Now is your opportunity to trade a keyset for a flawless condition 3rd anniversary limited run keyboard made by the infamous Fox Labs (see the traditional listing below for more pics and a sound check of the board).  If you have a majority of the kits listed above and are still interested in the f80SE I am willing to substitute paypal in for any missing kits, though the amount would have to be enough for me to buy them at aftermarket prices.~~

I ended up buying a couple sets straight up, so now it's just the traditional listing that's active:

|[Fox Labs F80SE](https://imgur.com/a/hU89tiE)|I have another fox labs board in e-white being delivered in a couple of days (TIME80-RE)that I feel will take the place of this one in my arsenal. It is built with lubed and filmed silent ghost switches (linear)that are a joy to type on.  Caps are JTK stormtrooper and are included in the trade/sale.  \[here's a sound check of the board\]([https://youtu.be/mqpzZleq-GQ](https://youtu.be/mqpzZleq-GQ). for transparency, I purchased this board for $650, the caps for just north of $60, and lubed/filmed the ghost switches.  Escape is a silent alpaca because I ran out of switches.|$850 shipped (or reasonable offer)|

Hi, looking to sell my build to enter the Aluvia GB.

I do not have a good reason to keep the GMMK Pro, because I'm always using the Huntsman TKL for gaming, and now that school is out I'm not going to be using the GMMK Pro at all.

I can clean the keycaps/keyboard if requested.

&#x200B;

* GMMK Pro: includes the PC plate, Durock V2 Stabs Lubed and Holee Modded, and 70x Durock POMs Lubed and filmed with Krytox 205g0 and Deskeys. I filled the remaining with a mix of switches - Comes with GMMK Pro and PC Plate Box, Asking $300 shipped SOLD FOR $200 (GMMK PRO + PC PLATE)
* GMK Olivia++ Light Base: Extremely used, bought on mechmarket as used, does not include original box. I can send you the original sellers pictures of the keycaps with the box, he never shipped it in the box due to shipping costs Will ship in plastic bag - Asking $300 Shipped
* KAT Mizu Wave - Blood moon - Comes in original box/sleeving, $45 shipped
* Koicap - My first artisan, looks amazing in person. I'm very attached so that is the reason I am asking $125 shipped, hope you understand (includes the container)

EDIT: Selling the Durock POM Linears for 70

&#x200B;

All prices are negotiable, besides the Koicap

Let me know if I missed anything, and I can ship out by Monday (I have another item to ship out by Monday)"

Need the funds at the moment so I'm selling off my gmk darling. I've had it for almost 2 months now but it's been very sparingly used, no shine whatsoever. The alphas definitely aren't as ""grainy"" feeling as a brand new one (or at least compared to the F and nav keys). I've tried my best to show it in the images. There's also some damage with the bottom tray but that's how I received it and I taped it up.

Hello, thank you for stopping by.

**I have included individual timestamps linked for each item below.**


a) I have a E-Black WKL Polaris. It was brand new until I built it a few days ago with a PC plate on a hotswap PCB (gaskets were applied on the case). I disassembled the board the next morning. I came to the conclusion I am not a huge fan of WKL. There is a tiny hair-line scratch on the bottom of the case but other than that it's clean. It comes with A LOT of extras (please see [timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/AWygUwp)). **I highly prefer to sell the entire bundle but if someone is interested in purchasing the board without extras please let me know. Those who are looking to purchase just extras, I will open up the extras for sale once the board is sold. Thank you for your understanding.** 

b) I also have a Metaverse R2 Base kit with the ""fix kit"" included. Please see this [timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/zaxbnMK) for all the details and even an explanation on the ""fix kit"".



**I am only shipping within the CONUS.**

$350 obro - KBD67 mkII ambiguous blue-color - in perfect condition with stock brass, extra PC plate, and unbuilt solder PCB. Case was used with another PCB previously. Also comes with both plate and case foam. I think price is fair given the extras, but if aftermarket prices are lower now then when I got it, that's on me, so offer what you think is fair.

Hey guys, 

Open to offers lower than asking but asking price has priority. If we've talked/traded frequently in the past, let me know if you're interested as well and I can drop price once again. If you can meet locally (San Jose, 95117), will give a discount since no PP/shipping fees. 

If you can meet locally, I work nights but am free between 7 a.m. and 1 p.m. daily. Sunday/Monday from 9 p.m. to 1 p.m. 

Shipped price includes Paypal fees and USPS shipping (international will have to recalculate).

Project Keyboard Sirius | POM Standard Layout Case with: Standard ANSI 6.25u POM/CF/PC Plates, Tsangan 7u FR4 Plate, Hotswap DZ60 RGB PCB (6.25u ANSI), and PVD Silver Weight. The USB cut out was purposefully expanded by removing a thin layer of POM that was sticking out at the bottom part of the USB cut out. Was having issues fitting thicker custom cables there so this was expanded (see timestamp gallery for closeup). No other modifications/damage to note of. | $350 for Bundle 
Escape Keyboards Jelly POM | Sugarcube Alphas, ANSI Fullsize Modifiers. Perfect pair with the Sirius for an all POM build. | $75

Hello, I have a GMK Future Funk base kit (Sealed, BNIB) that I'd like to trade for other GMK sets, ideally unused but at the very least with minimal shine. The Icon Mods kit (Sealed, BNIB) only included for some trades, as I do plan on using them.

The sets that I would love to trade for are: **GMK Darling > GMK Copper > GMK Camping (r1 latin alphas) > GMK Vaporwave > GMK Coral.** I will consider other GMK sets, please reach out with what you have - I generally don't like japanese sublegends.

Although I know some of the above sets have aftermarket pricing above Future Funk, I'm not really interested in adding Paypal to my end at this point in time (unless its Darling + Novelties or Copper + Novelties, then I will strongly consider adding). I also have a sealed Icon Mods kit that I would be willing to throw into the trade for Darling + Novelties or Copper + Novelties.

**I would also love to trade for 1/1 ETF 1k Hands (Thousand Hands) if anyone is feeling generous as I collect the sculpt.**

Not really interested in selling at all at this point in time, as such I'll set a ridiculous sell price of 385 USD shipped to CONUS/Canada for the base kit.

Comment before PM'ing. Have a great weekend all."

* ~~Almost~~ **~~Brand New~~**
* ~~Left Num, PC, Carbon Fiber Plate, mounted with C3 stabs (Lubed + Bandaid modded)~~
* ~~Got this from the extra sale, waited for 3 weeks, then another week since K.C forgot to include a PCB, finally put it together, mounted the switch and caps, and realized that this is numpad + 40% and not numpad + 60% (yes, I do feel like a dumb\*\*\* just in case if you are wondering).~~

* The board sounds wonderful. PC case + gold plate also looks great but I am accumulating too many 65s at this point xD.
* Note that the plate was modded around the spacebar to accommodate Durock Stabs. This was the common solution for this plate of Mark 65.

Local only since I’m not a fan of trading through shipping.

*SoCal* and surrounding areas. 

Hey r/mm, this has been sitting for a while and my interest has since dwindled. 

comes with everything it came with except the outer sleeve of the box it came in, which I kept since I thought it was cool. 

Wants: 

• gmk set (mainly looking for red)
anything monotone like minimal or bleached is cool too. 

Could add some cash on top for more sought after sets like Jamon, Botanical, etc. 

•Rama macro pad

• other color Karas

• Tofu65 acrylic with underglow

• I’m willing to throw the Kara in if you’re willing to trade your Think6.5v2 PC bottom and white badge for my Ocean bottom and ocean badge. 

• trade my milk M65b for your Yolk M65b and I’ll throw in the Kara noct. 

Not FCFS. I’ll consider all the options. Let me know what you got, thanks!"

Hello, thank you for stopping by.

**I have included individual timestamps linked for each item below.**


a) I have a ""B-stock"" E-Black WKL Polaris. It was brand new until I built it a few days ago with a PC plate on a hotswap PCB (gaskets were applied on the case). I disassembled the board the next morning. I came to the conclusion I am not a huge fan of WKL. It comes with A LOT of extras (please see [timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/AWygUwp)). **I am currently trying to NOT split the extras from the board, thank you for your understanding.** It has a tiny hair-line scratch on the bottom of the case but other than that it's clean. 

b) I have a pink paracord with white techflex genuine LEMO coiled cable from Coaxius. All the details are in this [timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/53jzLL7).

c) And finally, I have a Metaverse R2 Base kit with the ""fix kit"" included. Please see this [timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/zaxbnMK) for all the details and even an explanation on the ""fix kit"".



**I am only shipping within the CONUS currently.** 

**All prices are tentative, feel free to give me your best offer.**

Hey all,

Today I decided I am going to be moving on from mechanical keyboards to fund other hobbies and work so I am listing everything for sale as one big bundle.

I am not selling separately because I do not have the time at the moment to ship off a lot of packages and would rather keep it all together to save time. I am aware this will put people off but maybe for someone this is perfect to test a lot of different switches.

Apologies for the weird sale. I would like to be able to offer someone the chance to try out a lot but for a cheaper price than buying it all outright.

If anyone has any questions please let me know.

**~~I am looking to get £260~~** **~~inc shipping OBO~~** **- Sold**

Thank you for viewing!

Hey there r/mm. It's been a while, but with my recent move I rediscovered a couple artisans stashed away for a while. 

Left to Right:


Suited Up Keycaps Freedom Flayed Infernus| Keyforge NaCl Spook| Keymaker Animal Crossing Fossil Cap (OG Colorway)
--------|-------|--------

While I am offering these for trades, I'll mostly be interested in grey artisans that would match well with GMK Oblivion, or the dark grey of stock HHKB caps.

If you're looking for any of these, shoot me a PM with a trade, or if nobody does I'll put them up to sell in a couple days. Cheers!"

The shiny PVD bottom is gorgeous af and it's one of my favorite sounding boards and I'm only selling to recover some funds after recently acquiring a 7V.

The red looks very vibrant for ano compared to my previous red boards and it was the most limited color option as well in terms of units. Soft gaskets were installed on the bottom and hard gaskets on top case, includes extra gaskets, both foams, and the original carrying case.

I really like these sets. GMK Nautilus Nightmares is my favorite set all time, but due to financial circumstances, I need to sell some of my collection... I bought NN second-hand and one of the previous owners broke the left shift (seen in the timestamp).

Recently built a Tofu60, used for about a day, decided to sell it. Asking for **$215 USD**. No smoking in the house and no pets, I've kept it in its case for about a month. The specs are -  Acrylic case, Alpaca V2 Switches, Brass Plate, DZ60 3.0 pcb, Chalk-A Keycaps, Gmk Screw in Stabs (clipped, lubed, band-aid mod) (Alpacas are lubed with krytox 205g0 and filmed with tx.125 and are soldered in) .

If you would like the board without the keycaps i can take off **$45**. If you would like a carrying case with it it will be an additional **$30**.

Used to have a Drop Ctrl before I sold it, the buyer didn't want it with any keycaps so im left with the keycaps aka Drop Skyline Keycaps. If you would like it, Would be happy to sell for **$30**

I would be happy to ship anywhere as long as you can cover part of shipping fees.

Please comment before PMing or PM for additional information. **Thanks**"

Looking to sell a GMK Hennessey set that I bought from another user here. I bought the base kit when it was brand new and number pad kit basically brand new (used for less than one day).

I've used the set lightly for around 1 week, so it has basically no shine and in excellent condition. The set looks a bit yellow from the lighting, the set hasn't actually yellowed.

For shipping, I opt for Chunghwa post (significantly cheaper, and have shipped numerous times now without issue), but if you'd like FedEx/DHL (From experience, >$170 to the US), I can also try to quote. Note that I cannot be responsible for shipment issues after handling the items over to the courier.

Update Here: Sorry, but due to COVID-19, some countries have significant **extra shipping fees (Currently known: Canada, Australia, Switzerland...etc)**. While some **do not have this extra fee (Currently known: Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, USA...etc)**. If you are on the list of countries with extra fees, I might have to charge extra depending on kits you are taking (more kits = less extra charged).

The listed items is easily reachable and I can photoshoot them every two weeks. However I have more items (switches, pcbs, keyboard cases), which is too much work to photoshoot (it is really annoying to do that every two weeks), but you can ask me more options and I may list more items.

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-60 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct. You can write to me with a similar price I offer, however if this is not my offering price, there is much lower chance I will sell item right away or at all. Especially if price is fixed
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay, but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, ask :)*"

Hey MM! I will be selling the GMK Mizu Base set, novelties, and spacebar set with the deskpad. This was mounted on a 60% board and used for about a week, NO SHINE at all though the texture does not have that BNIB feel on some of the alphas. The deskpad shows some signs of wear around the bottom left corner and the righthand side around the middle from a mouse. It is from the first run so the colors are accurate and it is machine washable.

 Prefer CONUS but if you are outside that don't be afraid to msg about it. Not FCFS. **Will be only sold as a bundle and will not split the kits**

Hello mechmarket,

~~Space65 Cybervoyager:~~

~~The top case is green with a black bottom and an E-yellow LED and side badge. It is built with a carbon fiber plate, Durock stabs, lubed with Krytox 205g0 and Alpacas, lubed with Krytox 205g0 as well as deskey films. Unfortunately my cat is an agent of destruction and has left it with a small scuff on the side of the case. I have too many boards in my collection to justify keeping this board as well as the other I am offering in this post so I'm going to have to part ways with it. Comes with the original box and tool that came with the kit.~~

~~Asking $450~~   SOLD FOR ASKING

NiZ Atom68 Alu:

Top and bottom case are black with an E-white weight. Switches in this board are the NiZ electrocapacitive switches with 45G domes. Has an excellent soft typing feel with a nice thocky sound to it. Stabs are cherry plate mounted stabs which are lubed with 205g0. There is a small pinhole sized knick on the bottom right of the case next to the arrow cluster. Paid $418 for it during GB.

Asking $350

GMK Boba Fett:

~~Opened, minimal shine. Used on and off for about a month and was put back into the box and is now just collecting dust in my apartment.~~

~~Asking $400~~ SOLD FOR ASKING

Hello /mm SOLD SOLD SOLD!!!!

Since bundling has proven to be unsuccessful for me I've decided to provide a few more options to get this piece moved.

The kit:       
U80-A Milk Hotswap / Brass (Rose) Plate / W02-A Internal Dampener / Extra Solderable PCB.

The basics:       
U80-A Milk Hotswap built with ZealPC stabs lubed with 205g0, Tealios v2 lubed with 205g0 and filmed with TX films, GMK Hyperfuse Origins w/ Nightcaps HFO Fugu, ZapCables custom HFO aviator cable.

The summary:      
The board has only been typed on during the post build typing test and has been stored in a TX bag since. The U-80 is basically brand new, the weight is immaculate with no scratches, I can't attest to the plate because I have not popped the keycaps or switches off since building, but I'd imagine it's about as pristine as a plate would be on one time switch install. Stabs have been tuned to rattle-free perfection, and the switches are pure butter.

GMK HFO was also purchased new and never typed on except for the typing test, so there's no shine whatsoever. If purchased it will come with the full kit + an extras kit. The cable was a custom cable made by ZapCables on commission right before he stopped taking commissions. It's a purple cable with white techflex, black aviator and USB A - USB C.

Everything will be shipped in their original boxes.     

Prices:        
Kit only - Including board, plate, dampener and extra solderable PCB ($1100).       
Kit + switches SOLD!       
Full bundle ($1500).

Shipping to CONUS only or local meetup. I could do international at the buyer's shipping costs, but I'd imagine at that rate it might be better to just try to find a local deal. PayPal G&S."

Bonjourno,

**UK/EU ONLY. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE EITHER OF OUR TIME ENQUIRING IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE OF THIS REGION. PLEASE COMMENT BELOW AFTER PMING, NO CHATS.**

I am selling a variety of L&F Switches along with my beloved Tofu65, all listed below.

Switches, all have been broken in after a month or so of usage. Lubed and filmed as listed below;

&#x200B;

|Creampaca x 60|Mounted once on a hot-swap board. JWK Seal housing (same as the Alpacas, literally just a different color), NovelKey Cream Stem. Lubed with Krytox 205g0 on the stem, 105 on the springs. Filmed with Deskey films.|70GBP + Postage|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Milky Tealios (v2) x 68|Mounted once on a hot-swap board. Tealios switches (v2) with a milky gateron top housing. Spring swapped to 72g SPRiT slow springs. Lubed with Krytox 205g0 on the housing, 105g0 on the springs. Filmed with TX 0.15mm black films.|65GBP + Postage.|
|Moyu Black (Everglide Dark Jade) x 70|Mounted once on a hot-swap board. Lubed with Tribosys 3203 on the housing, 105g0 on the springs. Filmed with TX 0.15mm black films.|60GBP + Postage|
|~~Kailh Box Black x 65~~|~~Mounted once on a hot-swap board. Kailh Box black switches lubed with 205g0 on the housing.~~|~~10GBP + Postage~~                   **Sold for asking!**|

* HotKeysProject Hannya Darkness - **25GBP + Shipping**

Comes with the original little case it was shipped in - in perfect condition, a great match to GMK Red Samurai.

&#x200B;

* Tofu 65 x GMK Red Samurai (o-ring mounted) - **225GBP + Postage**

**ONLY SHIPPING TO UK.** Perfect for any beginner into the hobby - a nice 65% themed board with a classic GMK keycap set, all in one package, ready to be used. Comes with the listed items. **PLEASE BE PREPARED FOR LARGER SHIPPING COSTS THAN NORMAL AS THIS BOARD IS HEAVY.**

Used this board for close to 3/4 months now. Package includes;

* Tofu65 Burgundy (has one minor mark on the front, barely visible to the point where I struggled to get a picture of it, otherwise it's in very good condition and will come fully built). Comes with a brass weight on the back.
* GMK Red Samurai Keycaps (little to no shine, I have tried to demonstrate this in the images. **You will only receive the keycaps pictured on the board!**)
* DZ65 v2 RGB Hotswap
* DZ65 Case Foam
* Brass plate (with KBDFANs Module Foam on - this can be removed easily by yourself after purchase if wanted)
* Durock Stabilisers v1 (lubed with 205g0 and dielectric
* Franken switches to cover the board (cream housing, seal stem, filmed with TX 0.15mm and lubed with 205g0 on the stem, 105g0 on the springs)
* O-Ring mounts for the screw holes
* Sorbothane to go inside the case

**In order to fill this board fully with GMK Red Samurai, I had to buy both the ortholinear set and the 65% set incurring alot of costs spent on the keycaps (180USD) hence the price. Please do not try to negotiate this down, I'm not in a desperate rush to get rid of this so I'm happy to wait for the right buyer.**"

&nbsp;

Hi all,

KBD75v2 for sale with mods below. Pretty much redid the entire board after realizing KBDFans full assembly service wasn't too great. Originally came with unlubed Novelkey Creams.

&nbsp;

Mods:

1. desoldered using Hakko FR-301 (no residues except for the residues left from KBDFans)
1. resoldered with broken in lubed Creamerons (cream top, gat brown bottom, krytox-205g0)
1. Relubed original cherry stabs
1. Sorbothane (can remove if wanted)
1. Backspace and Space are L/F Lavender switches for a deeper sound
1. Some poron residue on plate that can scraped away (not noticeable with keycaps)
1. Comes with clone GMK Bingsu cherry keycaps
1. Comes with original box

&nbsp;

Feel free to reach out for sound tests/more images.

Reposting this sale post because the original buyer backed out of it last minute. 

Hey all! As much as it pains me to sell this board, a few things came up which are more important at the moment. Up for your consideration is my Rama M65-B in the Moon color. Its a hotswap and I have it built currently with lubed and filmed Alpacas. It also has Durock Alpaca edition stabilizers. Comes with Iced Internal Dampener. 

For full transparency, the Alpacas are lubed with 205g0 and filmed with Deskeys films. The spacebar 7u stabilizer housings are holee modded. I am also throwing in my Olivia Dark set which is currently on the board itself. No noticeable shine that I can see. I’ve typed on the board for about a month, but on the Olivia set for about a week or so. I am the second owner of the Olivia set and it was purchased here on r/mechmarket. It was shipped to me without the original box therefore I will be shipping it in bags. 

I would really prefer to bundle this board as it is built now.



Rama M65-B Moon - $900 SOLD LOCAL

Olivia++ Dark - $300 SOLD for $280

Alpaca V2’s - $50

Hello everyone!

I realized I don't really use these two boards so I'm looking to downsize or trade for other items. **For trades,** feel feel to offer what you have! If it's an arisu board of lesser value, I'm interested in other random things so feel free to message me. I'm also open to GMK sets, 65% boards, switches, desk set-up things (like grovemade accessories). No keycaps are included with the boards! For trades, you don't have to match the paypal value I set in this post!

I really want an Alpine65 Pom plate so please PM me if you're selling!

Prioritizing trades for arisu layout boards -> local trades -> bundles -> other

**Rama M-65B ICED**I haven't used this board much but I do like it. It comes with hotswap PCB, PC plate, mute mount, interior weight, and un-opened internal dampener that I just ordered. It also comes with an extra base. Not looking to really sell this board, but I'm willing to **trade** for other M-65B kuro or milk (I'll add paypal). My zip code 91739 for local trades. Selling price for everything is $850 OBO.

Willing to buy a brass plate for the m-65B! the PC board with the rest of the PC build makes it a bit too thocky and deep for me.

**Think 6.5 v2 1u Darth Vader**

I built this board with creampacas that are lubed and filmed + durock v2 smokey stabs. The board sounds amazing (very poppy). The number 3 key can *sometimes* spam but it hasnt really been a problem for me. Board comes with the original black think badge only and an extra PCB and extra gaskets. There is one small blemish that I put in the timestamp. Willing to trade this for whatever but i'm mostly looking for an ergo board and other random things to make an equal value. Selling price is ~~$750~~ **$700** OBO (price is for board + soldered creampacas/stabs + extra pcb).

EDIT: Not looking for a 7v board anymore. Thank you!"

Selling my M-65A. I've since gotten out of using 65% boards so I'm looking to sell this to someone that will actually use it. I purchased it from the original owner about three years ago.

There is a small mark on the top surface of the board (see last photo) and some micro-scratches on the plate/weight. Any scratches on the plate can't be seen with keycaps installed anyway. I could not find any other imperfections in my review of the board.

If you aren't interested in the zealios that I have installed, I do have a Hakko desolder gun that I could use to disassemble the board and sell it without switches. Price could be negotiated for this if interested.

Looking to sell everything as one bundle at this time.

**Details of the current build:**

* M-65A by RAMA from Keyclack GB
* Space Grey alu top
* Nylon base
* Polished Brass plate/weight
* QMK native compatible PCB with a v32u4 currently in the build
* 78g Zealios V2
* GMK stabs. Clipped/lubed with dielectric grease/band-aided

**Details of the extra PCBs:**

* (1) unused QMK native compatible PCB with a v32u4
* (1) unused BMC native compatible PCB with a v32a. As I recall, these can be flashed to run QMK instead but I found the QMK native PCB worked much better when I last messed with this.
* (1) DOA BMC native compatible PCB with a v32a. This one arrived DOA when I first purchased this board and I could never figure out the problem. Consider it usable for spare SMD components.

Hey guys, 

In the process of letting go of some boards and trying to downsize as much as I can. Open to offers lower than asking but asking price has priority. If we've talked/traded frequently in the past, let me know if you're interested as well and I can drop price once again. If you can meet locally (San Jose, 95117), will take off $30-50 from the customs and $20 for Oblivion. For stray extra parts, I’ll take off $5-10 if bundled with the cases. 

**Priority: Bundles/Local Sale > Shipped > Trades**

If you can meet locally, I work nights but am free between 7 a.m. and 1 p.m. daily. Sunday/Monday from 9 p.m. to 1 p.m. 

Shipped price includes Paypal fees and USPS shipping (international will have to recalculate).

The USB cut out was purposefully expanded by removing a thin layer of POM that was sticking out at the bottom part of the USB cut out.

No gaskets were used on the case/plate but half of them were cut out while retaining the sticky backing (can still be applied to case/plate) to experiment with different gasket locations/# of gaskets.

Also, R3 will be running soon on Drop if you're down to wait a bit to get the set. | ~~$250~~ **Sold**

**Highly prefer and will prioritize bundles including the cases + extras (badges, plates, RGB kits, artisan for Thinks) over separating them off. Will consider separating stuff later on if no one can/wants to bundle things together.**

Selling my first custom build. The board is in amazing condition with no visible blemishes whatsoever. Custom lasercut StupidFish plate foam has been installed. I would prefer to sell the board fully built with lubed Halo clear switches and GMK olivia clones. The Keycaps are amazing quality with clear and consistent legends. The full bundle would include the carrying case and usb cable as well as 30 stock Halo clear switches and around 70 lubed Halo clear switches. The board will come with a brand new Durock plate mounted stabilizer set from Divinikey. Pricing is flexible, let's negotiate.

I've seen this exact case without foam sell for 130-150 on the sub. **I believe a fair price for the entire bundle is around 230+ shipping.** Please PM me and we can work out a deal.

Hi mechmarket I'm here again to make a post for some of my keyboards that are not in use so I'm here to off load some of them, prices are all OBO and please don't be hesitant to send me your offers. Currently only shipping to CONUS and Canada.

1. **Lily58 - MysticMech 3D printed case, built with lubed aliaz +1 Box Jade\*: $120 shipped**This board was built to try out the split/ortho layout and safe to say it didn't work out too well, and while building it everything worked expect the key right below the oled screen on the right half, that key is marked by the box jade\*, I've tried fixing it but I have no clue what happened.
2. **ID80 - Black Alu case with acrylic bottom installed and original alu bottom case as well, has lubed gmk stabs (these stabs aren't tuned well, sorry): $120 shipped with one small caveat\*\***This board was my main board for a couple of months and it works fine, so why the caveat you might ask. So in the past the top right screw has been stripped and to remove the screw I had to use a screw extractor and during the process I scratched the case near that area and also damaged the thread in the case as well. So to properly screw in the case I had to use a slightly longer screw for that one specifically. Other than that the board works.
3. **PLA75 - 3D printed case from RNDKBD, Lubed Gateron Milky black, lubed GMK stabs: $130 shipped**A great board honestly, for what it is, it sounds pretty nice if I do say so myself. The stabs could use a bit of tuning but other than that it works fine. The pcb is your standard KBD75 pcb so it will show up on VIA as that. I have just moved on from larger boards and now been sticking with this board little brother the PLA60 for a while and I love the smaller form factor and just couldn't get back to typing on a larger board after that.
4. **KCK KY01 asking price $450 shipped.** Disclaimer the underside of the brass plate has some scuffage to it mainly scratches and such but once built it will never be seen, it has lubed holy bobas which was made using Boba U4 housing with halo clear stem with a 68g U4 springs. I have also included an extra pcb and plate in case you want to do your own thing with the build."

Hello once again,

I have the E-White Sunsetter Bundle designed by Charue Design! I recently purchase this off another r/mm user and it got slightly scuffed and acquired a nick through shipping. The markings can be seen in the album. There is a nick below the front badge and slight scratch to the side of it. There are also tiny scratches inside of the board that can not be seen when built (which is an accepted A-Stock by [Charue Design Quality Control](https://imgur.com/NyNH2YG)). There are no other external markings on the board.

It saddens me to let this board go as it sounds really good and the typing feel is very bouncy with the POM Plate, I also bought GMK Maestro and will buy KAT Great Wave to match it but the nick bothers me quite a bit. Hopefully it finds a new owner\~

The E-White Sunsetter Bundle Includes the following:

* E-White Sunsetter Board w/ Gaskets and Feet Bumpons Applied
* Extra Gasket, Feet Bumpons and Screws.
* Included Stickers
* Three Included Badges (Orange, Red, Brass)
* Two Soldered PCB (Unopened)
* One 7305 Mill-Maxed PCB
* One Brush Aluminium Plate
* Two Carbon Steel Plate (Unopened)
* One Polished Brass Plate (Unused)
* One White POM Plate
* Extra Bliss Badge
* Extra Eclipse Badge
* Three Rubber Sheet Plate Foam

In summary the board included all original accessories. **Three** Total PCB. **Five** Total Plates. **Three** Total Rubber Plate Sheet. Extra Bliss and Eclipse Badge

**ASKING FOR $700 Shipped CONUS only**

NOTE: **It does not include any switch, keycaps or stabilizers** although I can add Holee-Moded Durock V2 Stabs (Unlubed) KIT  for an additional $25

Hi everyone!

Looking to clear out some stuff that I've got sitting around in order to get some money for some upcoming trips I've got planned.

A few months ago I thought I was going to dive head first into split/ergonomic boards, but things didn't work out as I expected. Turns out I'm not a fan of split boards really at all, but I thought I was going to love them and build one for a couple friends of mine so I've got quite a few extra parts/pcbs sitting around not getting used.

As for the JAK artisans, I'm only looking for color swaps for these. I don't really have a preference on colorways, so let me know what you have that you'd like to swap for these Celestial Seafoams!

Also looking for a GMK Color Ring, if you've got one available! Trying to avoid buying one from Unikey since the shipping is so much.

Prices include shipping. (CONUS only)

**LOAD ALL THE PICTURES AND PLEASE PLEASE READ PICTURE CAPTIONS FOR ALL THE DETAILS**

Hello, thank you for stopping by.

**I have included individual timestamps linked for each item below.**

a) I have a ""B-Stock"" 7V Grey with an aluminum plate from NovelKeys. NovelKeys listed all their Grey 7V's as ""B-Stock"" on the Extras drop, but from my inspection, I could not find any eye-catching flaws with the one I received. Honestly, it's closer to A-Stock than B-Stock in my opinion. I have taken a few video clips showing close-ups of almost every angle of the board in the [timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/5nmfypE). Please take your time and look at ALL the pictures and videos for details. I ultimately want to get a Black 7V, but I figured selling and then buying would be easier than trading.

b) I have a E-Black WKL Polaris. It was brand new until I built it a few days ago with a PC plate and a hotswap PCB (gaskets were applied on the case). I disassembled the board the next morning. I came to the conclusion I am just not a huge fan of WKL; it just feels like there's something missing. It comes with A LOT of extras (please see [timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/AWygUwp)). It has a tiny hair-line scratch on the bottom but other than that it's clean. 

c) I have a pink paracord with white techflex genuine LEMO coiled cable from Coaxius. All the details are in this [timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/53jzLL7).

d) And finally, I have a Metaverse R2 Base kit with the ""fix kit"" included. Please see this [timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/zaxbnMK) for all the details and even an explanation on the ""fix kit"".

e) Oh and I almost forgot, I want to purchase a GMK Olivia++ Spacebar kit, if anyone has one and wishes to let it go for a reasonable price, please let me know.


I am only shipping within the CONUS currently. **All prices are tentative.**

To make it easier for buyers:

\- Shipping prices in eu generally are 4-15 euros (depends on various reasons (if it untracked or tracked), how big is the package)

\- Shipping prices to usa/canada generally are 20-70 (depends on various reasons, mostly size and weight affects price exponentially)

\- PRICE<60 € is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € for tracked;

\- 60=<PRICE<100 € (or just generally heavy) is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € - 3.5 € for tracked (unless listed otherwise)

\- PRICE=>100+ € items is sent via tracked/registered mail (unless asked otherwise);

\- Shipping to UK due to new regulations increase by roughly 3e (just add 3e to current EU price), but priority is EU > UK > Other.

In the future I may offer lube or soldering services, but I still need 2 trades to go :)

The listed items is easily reachable and I can photoshoot them every two weeks. However I have more items (switches, pcbs, keyboard cases), which is too much work to photoshoot (it is really annoying to do that every two weeks), but you can ask me more options and I may list more items.

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-60 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct. You can write to me with a similar price I offer, however if this is not my offering price, there is much lower chance I will sell item right away or at all. Especially if price is fixed
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay, but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, ask :)*"

House clearing time!

I've been meaning to sell my koyu for a while now, because I only realized after it arrived that it was a split backspace (lol). 

Honestly, have used it less than 30 minutes in total since I got it. Therefore, it's in MINT condition. No oils, no scratches, no dust build-up, etc. It's been an art piece sitting in an acrylic case all this time on my desk.

There's currently an internal dampener installed and the PCB is hot-swap w/ GMK screw-in stabs (non-lubed). I have all of the original packaging and an extra set of unopened feet.

Based off of past rama koyu r/mm posts, I'm just going to venture and say $2000 OBO shipped CONUS because of it's condition and. That being said, if you're around NJ then I'd much prefer to do the deal in-person for less.

Listing does not include caps or switches. If you're interested in the keycaps (ePBT GOK BOW + ePBT Grayscale Spacebar kits 1,2,3) or the switches (zealios v2 62g) then let me know and we can work something out.

Thanks!

Hello friends,

Going on a trip in a few weeks and those are expensive. Car rental prices will be the death of me, but whatever. Selling this board and set to help me not feel absolutely broke while I'm on my trip. Not really sure what the market for either of these are, but both are priced so that I won't lose anything from what I paid.

**WTS -**

* [**~~Primus by NexusProject/iLumkb~~**](https://imgur.com/a/p5MuIR5) **- Pending sale for $600 locally.**
   * ~~WKL, gray top, pink bottom, and gray weight. I originally wanted a sort of Olivia-themed board without having e-white in the equation. I think it looks great!~~
   * ~~1x PCB, 1x black aluminum full plate, 1x polycarbonate full plate, and plate foam.~~
   * ~~Will come in original box with anything that came with it originally.~~
   * ~~Pricing is based on what I paid after tax and shipping with the future selling fee in mind.~~
* **~~GMK Taro Base and Spacebars~~** **- Sold for $360 + shipping.**
   * ~~Base kit + spacebar kit from round 2.~~
   * ~~Mounted once. No flaws, no shine, no nothing.~~

If you want both the set and the board, I can do $900 + shipping :)

I didn't really have any plans to get the KAT Space Dust keycap set, so I was hoping to trade this for the Civilizations Kolkrabba if possible.  I know it came with the extra Archetype logo keycap, but I don't really have a need for it, so it's not necessary in the trade, but would be nice to have to complete the ""set"" of two.

Anyway, there's a few pictures in the album to show the specific colors on it, so let me know if you're willing to trade your Civ Kolkrabba.  Thanks!"

|[Mode Eighty First Edition - Dark WKL](https://imgur.com/a/bu4rtwP)|The original top piece is switched out to a Deco WKL as the original First Edition only came with a standard WK one. The shiny PVD bottom is gorgeous af and it's one of my favorite sounding boards and I'm only selling to recover some funds after recently acquiring a 7V.

Hello. I am selling a lot of stuff today to help clear some room and get more funds for other items that I have been wanting. Trying to get it out the door before Saturday. When Saturday rolls around, this post will be closed down until I come back from deployment and go home again. Don't know when that is happening. I will get it to the post office on the same day or next day. 

# If you see something you like, but you aren't sure about the price, feel free to message me to negotiate the price. ALSO PRICING MIGHT CHANGE OVER TIME. I WILL UPDATE THEM AND PUT THE UPDATES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POST. 

Prices are shipped based on CONUS + Alaska and Hawaii. CONUS offers FCFS. International sales is possible, but shipping will need to be calculated International offers are possible, but they are not FCFS.

But since this is time limited, I would like if you just buy it outright so I can get it sold and out the door before I leave. 

Here are the items down below with the prices. Also read the descriptions of some items. They might be ones that have deals to them. I have them grouped on some specifics.

**GMK sets:**

|GMK Sets|Description|Price|
:--|:--|:--|
|1. GMK Lime R1|Set of GMK Lime. Mounted once. No shine at all. The sidepack holding the artisans is still sealed. There is the R2 GB going on right now on Drop. If you are impatient, this is the best opportunity to get it as soon as possible. Deal down below for it.|$265 Shipped|
|2. ~~GMK Calm Depths~~|Set of GMK Calm Depths. Mounted a couple times with a little bit of milage to it. Still looks really good with very little to no shine at all. Great set for any dark or light colored blue board. Deals opportunity down below for it.|$265 Shipped|

**Keyboards:**

|Keyboards|Description|Price|
:--|:--|:--|
|3. ~~Sealed RAMA WORKS LNY20 Kuro M60-A (Hotswap)~~|Sealed Ramaworks M60-A LNY20 edition. That is basically it. The case itself is sealed, the regular items in the box that comes with it (cable, switch opener, stickers, pcb, etc.) is still sealed. I would love to have the stickers and envelope, so a deal below is offered if I can keep them and you save a bit for buying it from me. Will ship in original box that it got shipped it (so you can have the same opening experience that you can get to make it seem more brand new :D)|~~$600 shipped~~ **SOLD**|
|4. HHKB Layout KBDFans Tofu (NOT TFV2)|Original KBDFans Tofu. It was my first board and I am finally selling it, since I have gotten major upgrades since then. Comes with all that you see in the photo of it (my hand and hairy arm is not included, perv.). The sticker on the back is from Omnitype/Dixiemech when they ran a sale of HHKB stickers. I added it there for style and since it is HHKB layout. Also comes with some Durock stabilizers in it, since the original ones were terrible and you get them as a free upgrade right out of the box. You don't have to install them yourself now :D! Comes with my slightly modified QMK keymap. It is incredibly easy to remap it with the original layout if you wanted. Some basically invisible scuffs that are only visible in certain angles and lighting. Was kept mostly in the KBDFans case that is in another photo (which is also for sale). Super simple and super good beginner board that I highly recommend. Price is slightly higher than the for sale price on the website, due to the upgrades and sticker.|$175 shipped|

**Artisans:**

|Artisans|Description|Price|
:--|:--|:--|
|5. Keys and Crafts' Fuji Artisan|A very nice lemony artisan. If you like lemons, you will 100% enjoy this. It isn't edible. Looks very edible, but it would be way less than ideal for you to try and eat it. I am not liable for injuries caused by non-standard use of this keycap.|$60 shipped|
|6. Rose Key Koi Artisan|A very nice artisan from Rose Key. It has a small koi fish floating around in. Not a real one. Don't get too excited. We aren't that far in the future to have those yet.|$45 shipped|
|7. Dusty Caps 65% Blockerless Keyboard Artisan Keycap|In the Aldufin colorway. Overall not a bad keycap. Would be nice to put a tiny version of your own keyboard on your keyboard. So if you enjoy it, feel free to buy it from me today. |$75 shipped|
|8. Migi Caps SHADOW NewTwo and Blank Artisans Bundle|If you have played Pokken Tournament before, you may have seen Shadow MewTwo before. Due to copyright reasons and not wanting to get a cease and desist from Nintendo, this keycap has nothing to do with it. The colors are similar, but we will leave it at that. Overall, a pretty nice keycap. Doesn't fit much with my style, now that I have it on hand.|$90 shipped|
|9. Win Keys' Clutch Artisans Bundle|In the GMK Fundamentals VOL 1 and VOL 2 colorways, these would fit nicely for your incoming keycap set. Since I didn't get my hands on a spot for GMK Fundamentals, I am selling these to someone who has it and would like some nice artisans to match their kit.|$120 shipped|
|10. ~~Migi Caps Squirtle Squad Leader and Member Artisans~~|Artisans by Migi Caps. Comes as a pair (2 caps total). Based off the Squirtle Squad from Pokemon. |~~$90 shipped~~ **SOLD**|
|11. Blue Fox's Saur - Base Water Set Artisan|Very nice keycap. It may not be as good as a Char or Squir keycap, but it is still nice. Has a makers mark underneath it. Would fit very nicely on Pokemon themed builds. |$50 shipped|

**Misc. Keyboard items:**

|Items|Description|Price|
:--|:--|:--|
|12. ~~Rama Works Switch Puller~~|Just another Rama Works switch opener. It is the original Yolk yellow one. Pretty good color to it. Also bought two and I am selling the second one. Deal down below for it. |~~$10 Shipped~~|
|13. NovelKeys Keycap Puller|Just a sealed NovelKeys keycap puller. I bought two and I am selling the second one. Deal down below for it. |$9 shipped|
|14. Custom Aviator USB cable with extra connector|It is made by Asceny. It was their first run of cables that they did. It is a light blue color with clear techflex and comes with a Mini USB and a USB type C connector, so it should be able to fit most keyboards. The ends are heatwrapped. It is close to 5.5 feet long. |$30 shipped|
|15. ~~Rama Works M6-C~~|In the Rama Works Yolk colorway. Comes with some Novelkeys cream switches in it. Ill try to see if I can find the cable and throw it in for no extra cost. |~~$105 shipped~~ **SOLD**|
|16. Generic osu! macropad|Just a generic osu! macropad with USB-C and Kailh hotswap sockets, so you can use whatever MX style switches in it. I can send you over the software for reprograming it or just send you a link on where to get it. It is set up to play osu!standard. |$45 shipped|
|17. Gateron Laser Switches|Gateron laser switches. x70 of each variant. Pretty decent switches overall, but not much my taste. Not sure why I bought them in the first place, but I hope whoever buys them would enjoy them. Deal below.|$50 shipped for each one|
|18. KBDFans 60% keyboard carrying case|Used it for quite a bit. Decent thin carrying case with good padding inside to hold you 60% keyboard. It also has the capacity to hold a 65%, if you remove the 60% insert that sits in it. Definitely made for on the go keyboard carrying. Has been to many states across the US.|$30 shipped|
|19. Drop Holy Panda Box (BOX ONLY)|Literally the box that held some Holy Panda switches. YOU ARE NOT GETTING HOLY PANDAS BY BUYING THIS. IF YOU BUY THIS THINKING THAT YOU ARE GETTING HOLY PANDAS, YOU ARE MAJORLY WRONG. It is a nice bot to use to store switches. Deal for it down below.|$7 shipped|
|20. Southpaw75 extra PCB|Just a Southpaw75 PCB from HolySwitch.|$30 shipped|
|21. Switch Couture Alice PCB|Just the PCB that fits in the Switch Couture Alice case. It has USB-C on it.|$60 shipped|
|~~Alpha Keycaps Deskmat~~|From the GB that they had a few months ago.|$70 shipped|

**Deals offered:**

|Buy both GMK sets for $495 shipped.|
|The Hotswap Keyboard Kit Special: Buy both the keycap puller and switch puller for $17 shipped.|
|Artisan Special: For every artisan bought (unless you are buying just one), I will deduct $1 from the total price. So buying the two pairs, I will deduct the shipping cost added to all of them and deduct $4 for the 4 artisans.|

Please send me a list of the items you want to buy, and I will check to see if there is a deal, give you the calculated price, and after that, send me over your paypal email. If you want to buy something outright with little to no wait, send me the list of items that you want and your paypal email in one message. I will send over an invoice as soon as possible. 

Every item on the list has a number next to it to help make lists faster. You have the options to use the numbers to create a list faster in your message, or use whatever you want to help identify the items you want. Your call there. 

#This is only offered until Saturday. After that, I will have to close this post down, as I won't be here to ship stuff. I will be on deployment soon, so I will be gone for a long time. 

Small disclaimer: None of the standalone PCBs that I am selling have been tested. You are buying it as is from me. They have not been put in any extreme conditions that would constitute an effect on functionality. It will be packed well to help protect it in shipping.

Also forgot to mention that the Wongbox is not for sale. Just to hold the artisans.

Hey guys, got some stuff for sale/trade. Excuse the formatting. Only looking to ship in CONUS, and will be prioritizing trades somewhat. Local is 33196 down here in Miami. Comment before PMs please.

-Think 6.5 V2: I bought an e-white and polycarb to mix and match the cases, the poly top and white bottom is what’s leftover. It’s new/unbuilt but package was opened to do the case swap. Will come with all the original stuff, an extra pcb and extra FR4 plate from the GB. Will also throw in 2 of the 4x4 RGB kits. Looking for $600 shipped, $560 local which is what I paid at GB or trades from wants list. Would be willing to split out the extra PCB + Plate if need be.

-GMK Sandstorm: Sealed/new, looking for trades for stuff below.

-Doohickey Kudzu Aquafresh: Love these artisans :) looking to trade for other colorways or stuff from the wants list

• Wants: if possible can trade any of the above for anything below +/- cash.

-Iron165 in plum or graphite

-Cypher in red, preferably unbuilt or with a unused pcb.

-GMK ashes base, ghost, caldera kits

-GMK Mizu + novelties

-GMK burgundy base kit

-GMK jamon just the pata negra kit. Only kit I’m missing to complete my set.

Hello, I'm selling my board and keycaps to fund a different hobby of mine.

&#x200B;

Key65 - Grey color with yellow weight. Built with Gat black inks V2 (205g0 lubed/105 on springs/deskey filmed) on FR4 plate with zeal stabs. I also have the original titanium plate which is built with FFF switches which are also lubed and filmed. Note the stabs with the titanium plate are overlubed as well as some switches. Both PCBs are solder. Looking for $600 OBO.

&#x200B;

GMK Metaverse R2 - Nothing to much to say here. I have used it and there is a bit of shine mostly on the WASD keys. Asking for $350 OBO for base and novelties.  SOLD.

&#x200B;

If you want both I'll sell for $900 combined. Thanks for looking and have a nice day!"

Hi everyone!

Looking to clear out some stuff that I've got sitting around in order to get some money for some upcoming trips I've got planned. 

A few months ago I thought I was going to dive head first into split/ergonomic boards, but things didn't work out as I expected. Turns out I'm not a fan of split boards really at all, but I thought I was going to love them and build one for a couple friends of mine so I've got quite a few extra parts/pcbs sitting around not getting used.

As for the JAK artisans, I'm only looking for color swaps for these. I don't really have a preference on colorways, so let me know what you have that you'd like to swap for these Celestial Seafoams!

Prices do not include shipping. (CONUS only)

If you know how to remove a stripped screw, or don't plan on taking apart the keyboard, then this is for you. Just looking to get my money back on this one -~~ **~~179USD shipped~~** **SOLD for asking**

Hello, back with another post! Just letting go of some stuff that I'm no longer planning to use. I normally would strike through product descriptions, but I will leave them up to help guide those who are looking to purchase any of the items listed below. 

Highly prefer shipping to USA addresses at the moment. All prices include **USPS Priority Mail** shipping costs.

**If you are local to 94706, I am fine doing local pickup/meetup and will lower price to reflect it.**

Item|Details|Price|Available
:--|:--|:--|:--
GMK Oblivion v2 | Regular base, Hagoromo Cadet Alphas, and spacebars. Don't want to wait until 2022 or 2023 to get Hagoromo alphas? Here's your chance. Very little to no shine. Fair warning: given the wait for Oblivion v3.2 to get Hagoromo alphas, it may be better to buy now and ask questions later. Selling only as bundle unless I find enough buyers for all kits. Shipped in bags| $420 shipped | **SOLD FOR $405 SHIPPED**
Idea23 Topre HiPro set | resin set by Idea23 made to fit HHKB. Thought I'd enjoy using this more after wanting a set for years, but I've found myself going back to the stock HHKB keycaps. Price is what I paid for them at retail | ~~$130 shipped~~ | **SOLD FOR $120 SHIPPED**
100x Kailh Poilas | I was going to use these to make Holy Pandas/Bobas for a friend, but they opted to go with Boba U4Ts instead for their next build. People on Keebtalk state that these stems are fine to make Holy Pandas/Bobas. Price is below what I paid even after 50% off on Novelkeys. | ~~$28 shipped~~ | **SOLD AS BUNDLE**
~80x YOK Trash Pandas | I was going to use these to make Holy Pandas/Bobas for a friend, but they opted to go with Boba U4Ts instead for their next build. Price is below what I paid at retail from Novelkeys | $40 shipped | yes!
~50x lubed Gateron yellows | Milky top, black bottom. Lubed with 205g0 on stem only and Super Lube on stock springs. These are just leftover from like three different builds and are just taking up space for me. | ~~$20 shipped~~ | **SOLD AS BUNDLE**
~70x KS3 Gateron yellows | brand new, unused. I just can't bring myself to lube these so they're going out the door. Price is what I paid below retail. | ~~$15 shipped~~ | **SOLD FOR ASKING PRICE**

I am also looking to trade for the following items:

 * GMK Darling spacebars + extension kit
 * GMK Solarized Dark
 * GMK Burgundy

Priority for responding to offers will be as follows:

 * **Having anything that I'm looking to trade for!** Please include PayPal email in case that either side has to add PayPal for the trade
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing all items for asking price (will give discount for purchasing all items listed here because holy moly that means you have money)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any bundle of items for asking price (will give discount for purchasing some sort of bundle of items listed here because holy moly that means you have money)
* **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any one item for asking price

Outside of the listed conditions, I'll check based on when you comment **and** PM. The PM is absolutely necessary for the sale of these items. Please understand that if you as a buyer and I agree on a price and you back out of the purchase right after I send the invoice, I will refuse to sell anything to you in the future (yes, that includes if you offer me something like $300 on something that I'm selling for much less). 

 **Do not use the chat function**, I honestly don't know how you are taken to the chat function when the bot's verification post gives you a link to PM sellers. I will ignore you and you won't be in consideration for anything until you send me a PM. I will also ignore you if you do not comment before sending a PM.

If I don't respond, it's likely because I'm just busy doing other things. I will get to all messages accompanying comments in a timely manner. Thank you for your time."

Hey everyone, looking to sell these items, ideally some grouped together. Prices do not include shipping.

~110 Lubed and filmed black inks: $130

Lubed with 205g0, will not sell smaller batches

RAMA Vaporwave x2: $150 each
RAMA Voyage x1: $200

Took photos of all side as best as I could trying to avoid glare on caps. If you want more pics of a specific cap lmk.

TGR Jane V2 PCB + Lubed Stabs + TGR Brass Plate: $200

I sold my Jane a while ago, and I forgot about these extras lying around. I prepped some stabs for a build I wanted to do, but obviously never got around to do it. The PCB has not been tested, but it has not been used and has just been sitting in storage. Wasn't too sure how to price it, so I just based it on the only post I saw that sold this combo for $120 for a desoldered PCB + used brass plate. Will not split up.

GMK Dots R1: $300

Mounted once for photos, been in storage since. Will be shipped in bags. Can discuss further if box and tray are deal breakers.

I am located near DTLA, California, so I could also do a local sale for cash.

If someone wants to buy everything, I'll give a $100 discount, any purchases that are $400+ I'll give a $50 discount.

I’ll prioritize group sales first, then local. I would like to keep it to CONUS shipping, but if you’re willing to pay for a more expensive priority shipping internationally, I could do that too. Comment and send me a pm if you're interested, thanks!"

Several scrapes/scratches on the inner rim that aren't visible with keycaps on. Doesn't come with switches but we can have a bundle if you want, as I have some spare lubed tealios v2s, Ink blacks and 67g Tangies. As seen in the pictures, there is some cuts in the gasket mod. Still has been working for me for a few months since it happened. Also has extra plate and extra insert thing (to replace the panda lol idk the name)

I was planning on desoldering and changing all the switches to Healios V2s however I got lazy half way through and literally just changed the tops/stems/springs. The bottom left few keys you can see are fully resoldered with Healios v2s. look man, mistakes were made. Also this uses split left shift and a stepped capslock in the current build. Also the escape key is a bit finnicky because the top half of the switch I replaced it with wasn't perfect.. if you switch it out you can fix it. it's not that it doesn't work it's just... finicky...~~ **SOLD FOR ASKING** |

Hi guys, still have some stuff that needs a new home. Pictures of most items are in the timestamp.

Please comment before PM, no chat, thanks (there is an auto-generated comment down below where you can click for PM).

Prices include PayPal fees, but not shipping and they are based on what I paid and/or the amount of work I put in. Shipping is ca. 5€ in Germany, ca. 12€ in EU, depends on the size of the item. Shipping is EU-only, sorry!

Have a good one! =)

I am selling my beloved d65 to afford all the group buys I recently joined. I've used this keyboard since the second week of March this year \[I am the original buyer from KBD, have proof of purchase if needed\].

Currently, I have lubed (krytox 205G0) and filmed (deskey films) on ink-black gateron v2s installed on the keyboard as well as ePBT Kon Momo keycaps. I also have zealpc stabs installed. The standoffs are not installed (to make the keyboard more flexible) but the gaskets are installed in the keyboard. There are no scuffs on the case or any issues with the keyboard. I am willing to part the keyboard without the keycaps and switches but would prefer to part it all together to save me the time of removing keycaps and switches.

I have all the original components that came with the keyboard (extra gaskets, screwdriver, extra blocker, and the original keyboard box from kbdfans).

Howdy everyone!

I have a couple of things for your consideration today :)

&nbsp;

##[Please Read]

> ❧ Not FCFS, Trades > Bundles > Sales

> ❧ **If we trade/I buy from you, please declare the package as a gift and at $20 max.**

> ❧ All prices are OBO and mostly retail or under

> ❧ **Prices include PP fees but don't include shipping (PM me for confirmation)**.

&nbsp;

##[Have]

**All boards and/or artisans are sold at cost, not trying to make money off of these, just trying to move a couple of things to fund another hobby (MtG for those curious) and fund a board purchase. That said, all prices are OBO so feel free to shoot me an offer! <3**

###Artisans

.| 1|2 |3 |4 |5 
---|----|----|----|----|----
A | Heavy Metal Gamer Set (FPS) [$220] | See A1 | See A1 | See A1 | See A1 | See A1
B | Free upon request |Oji Gatekeeper^1 [$40] | Yzzerdd Gatekeeper^1 [$40] | Muad'dib Gatekeeper^1 [$40] | BillyWitchDoctor Gatekeeper^1 [$40] | - 
C | Sandun Diablo 2021 [$50] | T-Lab carbon Mooe [$50] | Holy Milker Care Bare v2 [$45] | Oasis Blank [$10] | Oasis Tree of Life [$15]

^1 Bundle all Gatekeepers for 120 shipped.

####Artisans need to go so I'll look into all offers I get, or take all the above for $420 shipped (to most countries), including the box.

&nbsp;

###Keyboards & Keysets

1/ **Novatouched** FC660C bundle (bundle only*) [$950 shipped]

**PLEASE DON’T PM ME SAYING YOU’RE INTERESTED IN THE BUNDLE AND THEN BACKOUT SAYING YOU DONT WANT THE CASE…**

> ❧ Hasu + Stock controllers

> ❧ Novatouch sliders (the ones installed on the board + 21 extras from the novatouch) + stock sliders

> ❧ Stock domes (FC660C + Novatouch) + +/- 20 Reduc light domes

> ❧ Lubbed with 205g0 and silenced, sounds amazing

> ❧ Comes with the FC660C original box, original cable and the novatouch original case and domes.

> ❧ Plate has a couple of marks here and there, nothing major - came like that from the previous owner.

\* I already have a couple of people interested in the novatouched FC660C, I will only split this if I can find someone to buy the Yui660 case (asking retail @430+shipping OBO); I'm otherwise not looking to split.

/!\ does not come with a keyset

&nbsp;

2/ E-White MAJA [$400 + shipping] **OBO**

> ❧ Hotswap PCB

> ❧ Wrist rest

*does not come with switches, stabs nor a keyset*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

##[Want]

###Artisans

❧ Bro Crimson Dusk Gamer Set

❧ Siren Salvador, Tamago Salvador, Pika Salvador, potentially other Salvador colorways (but I'll be extremely picky, sorry)

❧ Bongo (depends on the color, fruit, non fruit, want one for my fiancée's board so she'll have to approve the colorway hehe)

&nbsp;

###Keysets

**SOLD**  

**Brief description:** 
This is a pretty scuffed “leftovers”-keyboard that I’ve used as an in-between-group-buys keyboard over the past 3 months.

**Items included**: USB-C PCB w GMK screw-in stabs & linear switches, Black on grey PBT Gentleman Keycaps, KeyboardBelle Cadette Mint Case.

P̶R̶I̶C̶E̶S̶| SOLD

**SE** PRICE: | 3̶6̶0̶ ̶S̶E̶K̶ ̶i̶n̶c̶l̶ ̶s̶h̶i̶p̶p̶i̶n̶g̶|



**In depth description:** 
It’s comprised of a soldered and VIA-flashed USB-C SATAN ""GH60"" 60% PCB that sports a weird frankenswitch combination of **Yok Trash Panda housings** with **JWK L3 Pink stems** and springs from MX Browns (60g?) and a 67g spring on the spacebar. There’s no lube aside from a little residual stock lube on the stems. 

I messed up the top housing of the spacebar, so I had to replace it with a Cream top. I also didn’t have enough panda housings, so I had to use 4 other leftover Cherry housings in place of Capslock, right FN, right shift, and the key to the right of it.


They’re a decent linear, but kind of scratchy and don't sound very good. It has GMK screw-in stabs lubed with Krytox 205g0 on the enter and space keys. 

There is no stab on the left shift, a lazy move on my part but it’s something that I barely even notice.

This is my first time posting to r/mechmarket, so apologies if I've broken any rules or if my pricing is wack.

I recently switched to Notion, and am selling Mizu to deal with some upcoming expenses. The set was used on a standard layout 60% Tofu, and has shine on the alphas, spacebar, and some modifiers.

The listed price is ~~**$450 USD**~~ (or NZD equivalent).

Pricing includes NZ-wide shipping (although I somehow doubt I'll be able to find a local buyer). PM for international shipping.

For shipping, I opt for Chunghwa post (significantly cheaper, and have shipped numerous times now without issue), but if you'd like FedEx/DHL (From experience, >$170 to the US), I can also try to quote. Note that I cannot be responsible for shipment issues after handling the items over to the courier.

Update Here: Sorry, but due to COVID-19, some countries have significant **extra shipping fees (Currently known: Canada, Australia, Switzerland...etc)**. While some **do not have this extra fee (Currently known: Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, USA...etc)**. If you are on the list of countries with extra fees, I might have to charge extra depending on kits you are taking (more kits = less extra charged).

Hello friends,

Hope your summers are going well. I'm performing some overdue spring cleaning so I have to part ways with stuff I love but am not using. Priority goes to buyers local to Los Angeles. Comment before PM, people who do not comment will be ignored, and I have chats disabled. Thanks for reading and have a good rest of your weeks!

Apple Extended Keyboard II | ~~$425 shipped, $400 local~~ **Sold!** | [Type test here.](https://imgur.com/a/Q3tKPv4) AEKii built with SKCM Blue Alps, lubed with PTFE and paper modded, on an ELMO (USB-C) PCB. Switches cleaned and lubed and case retro-brited by the wonderful u/Icemanrec. This is probably my favorite board I've ever owned -- the Blues sound awesome and the tactility is A1 -- but I don't use it enough and I would prefer it go to someone who will use it and appreciate it more. Some minor scratches on the top piece and the plastic nub that is usually underneath the Apple logo came off, which is how it was when Iceman owned it. Just asking what I paid for it.
Dolch PAC 65 w/ new TKC1800 PCB | ~~$250 shipped, $225 local~~ **Sold!** | Bought from mechmarket, will come with the keyboard as-is and a sealed TKC1800 PCB. I intended to take this apart and rebuild it with the TKC1800 but I never got around to it so it's been sitting in a box in my closet since I got it. Body has some minor signs of wear but is otherwise in great condition, bar one rubber nub missing on the bottom (pictured in timestamps). Keycaps have little shine, only visible at some angles, and the MX Blues underneath still feel great. I can throw in some denture tablets if buyer doesn't have any on hand.
Abkoncore AR87 | ~~$200 shipped, $180 local~~ **Sold!** | Just recently bought from [this person](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/ntqjsv/usma_h_hotswappable_ar87_budget_duck_orion_sa/). Millmaxed with 0305, built with GMK plate mount stabs, O-ring mounted. I intended to give this to a friend as their starter board but they decided on another layout so just wanna pass it on for what I paid for it. Will come with board built as-is, stock white-on-black keycaps, cable, keycap puller, switch puller, and washers."

## CU65 - $140 + Shipping

Waited an eternity to receive this and purchased/received other boards before it arrived.  Has sat unused on shelf after putting together.  Lubed Durock V1 clear stabs.  Bottom is missing one screw (see pics); the pole does not line up to screw hole so did not want to jam screw in.  PCB was near impossible to install (off position pole + pcb hole size?) so would recommend not trying to remove, ever.

\-Brand New PCB

\-Lightly used PC plate (a few marks)

This is my second time posting here, thanks.

I'm selling those very nice budget prebuilds and budget keycaps.

Every keyboard is in like new condition, unboxed and used lightly, comes with all stock accessories and packaging, unless noted below. Every keyboards has the stabs relubed and fixed, so they sound a bit more consistent and nicer than out-of-the-box.

**Pricing (including basic USPS ground shipping):**

AKKO 3068 Silent Bluetooth Gat Brown, Akko 3068 is firmware updated so the bluetooth connection is stable now (previously it will intermittently disconnect and won’t wake it back, a known issue. Now fixed), asking $70

AKKO 3084 9009 Gat Red, no bluetooth, asking $80

Keychron K6, with non-hot swappable gat optical brown switches, RGB no aluminum corners, $60.

Keychron K6, hot swappable, with Kailh box black switches, foam modded, LED white light, no aluminum corners, $75 due to the updated switches and foam modding. Add $8 and I will include the stock 68x Gat reds.

Friends far from west coast please consider adding a few bucks so I would use USPS priority shipping, but if you don't want to add for shipping it's totally fine, it's just a bit slower using the cheaper way to ship. Any questions let me know, thanks for reading!"

# EVERYTHING has been SOLD as a bundle for $1150

# Rama M65-A + Extras + GMK Signal Bundle - $799.99 - SOLD

Original owner, bought from Keyclack GB back at the beginning of 2017. Sad to see this piece of history go, but I'm just not into 65s these days so passing on to someone who will hopefully appreciate it more.

Bundle Includes:

* Black top - no visible flaws
* Hydro Blue aluminum bottom - no visible flaws
* Black PVD brass weight (some very minor micro-scratches) and black feet (the blue is really, really nice in person - a GREAT match for GMK V4 blue)

* Black hardware
* JC65 Bootmapper PCB (Atmel mega 32a, USB mini, can be converted to QMK)
   * Brand new, fully tested and functional
* Keyclack QMK-65v1 PCB (Atmel mega 32u4, USB mini, AKA JC65)
   * Desoldered w/ Hakko gun, fully tested and functional
* Black PVD brass plate - some slight smudging around the edges, but nothing major visible
* Black aluminum plate
* 2 Sets of spare rubber feet (one black, one grey)
* Rubber washers for half-burger mounting
* GMK Signal (AKA Blue on Black) base kit + spacebars kit included. Set has some very mild shine.
* Board ships in original box, keyset ships in bag.

Some older glamour shots: [https://www.instagram.com/p/Bra9xyaHXWe/](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bra9xyaHXWe/)

Only willing to split GMK signal if there are buyers for both the board and the set.

* Stacked acrylic, Wonderland PCB (USB-C)
* PCB desoldered once with Hakko gun, fully tested.
* Large bumpons to give a bit of angle.

|Think6.5v2 extra plate |White FR4, brand new. |45 + shipping or 35 w/ board|
|JTK Suited Assasin |BNIB: Base, Cyrillic Alphas. Got these from the extras drop but then got IFK Dark Cyrillic and don't need both. Some of the keycaps got out of the trays, I will rearrange and ship in OG packaging. |220 + shipping |
|Mauves x 67| 60 are lubed with 205g0 on the housings and 105 on the springs. Filmed with tx films and swapped to 68g long springs. These have been desoldered 1 time, and it is not the cleanest. It would probably work on a hotswap board but to be safe recommend soldering these. The other 7 are stock. Desoldering job is scuffed but they are super smooth, just too heavy for me. |30 + shipping |

Trading:

Hi Mechmarket, it's been a while since my last post on here. This time I'm just looking to offload some of my unused budget boards that I have built during my early days in the hobby and now just sitting on a shelf, hopefully I can find them a new home. As always, all my prices are OBO and will subject to change if deemed out of line. Currently only shipping within continetial US! This saves both me and the buyer trouble of exporting and importing these boards.  


1. **Tofu60 - Ewhite case, WT-60c pink pcb, lubed nk creams, durock v1s: $170 shipped (OBO)**  
Nothing bad to say about this board, it's your typical tofu60 build, so I'm hoping to get $170 shipped for this.
2. **Lily58 - MysticMech 3D printed case, built with lubed aliaz +1 Box Jade\*, blank DSA caps from KPrepublc I think(?) (It's been a while since I got these so I totally forgot where I got them): $130 shipped**  
This board was built to try out the split/ortho layout and safe to say it didn't work out too well, and while building it everything worked expect the key right below the oled screen on the right half, that key is marked by the box jade\*, I've tried fixing it but I have no clue what happened. Buyers of this board will also get the rest of the blank DSA that is shown in the ziplock bag as well.
3. **ID80 - Black Alu case with acrylic bottom installed and original alu bottom case as well, has lubed gmk stabs (these stabs aren't tuned well, sorry): $120 shipped with one small caveat\*\***  
This board was my main board for a couple of months and it works fine, so why the caveat you might ask. So in the past the top right screw has been stripped and to remove the screw I had to use a screw extractor and during the process I scratched the case near that area and also damaged the thread in the case as well. So to properly screw in the case I had to use a slightly longer screw for that one specifically. Other than that the board works.  

4. **PLA75 - 3D printed case from RNDKBD, Lubed Gateron Milky black, lubed GMK stabs: $150 shipped**  
A great board honestly, for what it is, it sounds pretty nice if I do say so myself. The stabs could use a bit of tuning but other than that it works fine. The pcb is your standard KBD75 pcb so it will show up on VIA as that. I have just moved on from larger boards and now been sticking with this board little brother the PLA60 for a while and I love the smaller form factor and just couldn't get back to typing on a larger board after that.

&#x200B;

Super sorry for the wall of text that is this post. Thanks for stopping by and stay safe!

Hey guys, got some stuff for sale/trade. Excuse the formatting, doing this from my phone. Only looking to ship in CONUS, and will be prioritizing trades somewhat. Local is 33196 down here in Miami. Comment before PMs please.

- Think 6.5 V2:
I bought an e-white and polycarb to mix and match the cases, the poly top and white bottom is what’s leftover. I wanted to keep it, but its been sitting in the box for a few weeks now and can’t justify having yet another unbuilt 65% laying around. It’s new/unbuilt but package was opened to do the case swap. 
Will come with all the original stuff, an extra pcb and extra FR4 plate from the GB. Will also throw in 2 of the 4x4 RGB kits. Looking for $600 shipped, $575 local or trades from wants list.

- GMK Sandstorm:
Sealed/unused, only looking for trades.

- Doohickey Kudzu Aquafresh:
Love these artisans :) looking to trade for other colorways or stuff from the wants list

• Wants: if possible can trade any of the above for anything below +/- cash.

-Iron165 in plum or graphite

-Cypher in red, preferably unbuilt or with a unused pcb. R3 is so close I can taste it so might hold out on this depending on when max finally reveals the colors.

-GMK Ashes base plus other kits

-GMK Mizu + novelties

In a tight spot financially so just looking to get back some of what I paid for this. Around $150+ less than what I paid for for the board and cable, the mat is a free add on beyond this. It is only very lightly used and it was built in February. It feels buttery smooth and sounds just as great as it looks.

This was built by AndyVNguyen on his twitch stream. It’s the Design02 stacked curved acrylic keyboard from Arctangentkb in matte daffodil with sandblasted brass (slight patina on it), kbd67 rev2, and stupidfish plate foam. These options price at $310

Durock V2 clear stabs $26

VoxelMods 10.5 inch coil cable with yellow MDPC-X and techflex, with a gold aviator connection, and the included wooden rod to put inside the coils to hold its shape. $98

I’ll also throw in the GMK Honey lemon and honey desk mat for free for this set. Won’t sell it alone, I got a tiny bit of thermal paste on it accidentally so I’d rather just toss it in with the rest of the honey themed matching set.

So total I’m just looking for $330+shipping. I’d prefer to remain within continental US for now. I’m in Melrose Park, Illinois if you’re local and wanted to see/try it in person before you buy"

I have a Space65 CV in Black with a Gold badge and a Drop CTRL High Profile Space Gray

Space65 Board (bought from a user on here a month or two ago). And a hotswap pcb also bought from a user here a month or two ago. It's in pretty much new condition other than I built it and used lightly for some gaming (mostly TFT). I'm selling this one because I've bought a couple boards recently and am planning on buying more in the future so I'd like to make some ""space"".

It comes with:

* board and badge
* hotswap pcb (bought separately and used lightly)
* solder pcb (opened to test if working unused)
* CF plate
* pcb foam
* Original box

It will NOT come with the keycaps/artisan in the timestamp. (but if you want the keycaps they are GMK WoB bought  on drop and can negotiate a price)

Asking for $800 shipped. Open to offers as well so don’t be afraid to ask. SOLD FOR ASKING

&#x200B;

Drop CTRL High Profile Board Space Gray

This one is unused. Basically I had some issues with the initial board I had from drop and support told me to send it in and they'd ship me a new one. Not sure whether to label it as ""new"" or like a refurbished or something tbh.

It comes with:

* Drop CTRL high profile board
* Halo Clears
* Original usb c cable
* keycap puller
* Box it came in

Asking for $150+shipping -SOLD FOR ASKING

Hi, I'm looking to sell my beloved Space65 Cybervoyager (black colorway, gold rear badge, grey/blue led badge, switches are gateron yellow inks with black housing). I didn't use it that much, therefore, there are no scratches or dents. I paired it with the GMK Nautilus (I will provide it in a bag, I'm sorry I got rid of the box). It's a great board. It is a solder PCB, there is a slight issue with the 'caps lock' key, but that is not something that is hard to fix. I do not have the equipment for soldering, so I just left it as is. I'm looking to sell it as a bundle together. I like to make things affordable, so I looked up the price for both within the market. My price I am looking for is $720 shipped CONUS. I believe this to be a reasonable price for what you are getting! If not, please PM me and we can always work things out."

|[Mode Eighty First Edition - Dark WKL](https://imgur.com/a/bu4rtwP)|The original top piece is switched out to a Deco WKL as the original First Edition only came with a standard WK one. The shiny PVD bottom is gorgeous af and it's one of my favorite sounding boards. The top case is flawless but the bottom has two light scratches. Comes with a hotswap PCB and FR4 plate as well as the carrying case. Looking to trade this for a 7V (preferably black or navy), pp can be added if needed.|~~Trade for 7V~~/$850|

[W] Paypal, GMK Godspeed Columbia, GMK Denim, ePBT Ivory","Hi all! [Timestamp.](https://imgur.com/gallery/rUW3xP6)

Today I have some more switch sets I am looking to get rid of! All sets are unused(only mounted to test functionality and consistency) and are lubed with krytox 205g0(avoiding legs on tactiles) and filmed with Deskeys!

I also have a set of DROP MT3 Susuwatari that is barely used at all (mounted once and used for less than an hour). I really liked the set until I had it in my possesion so now I am looking to get it to a more appreciative home. Set is like new and in original packing so I am looking to lose 10-15 on it off Amazon/Drop pricing. I am also in the search for some keycap sets as listed in title (GMK Denim, ePBT Ivory, and highest priority GMK Godspeed Columbia) I would prefer new/like new but am flexible if the price is right!

I am also looking to get rid of a Frosted Red SMKeyboards Acrylic holder as I impulse bought it and do not have enough artisans to fill it, so I am hoping to get it somewhere where it is utilized. It is entirely unused, and has no damage whatsoever

Lastly, I am looking to start making some wooden wrist rests on a commission basis. I am attaching a photo of my current wrist rest for one of my boards. I am chamfering one edge for comfortability but I can do essentially anything someone wants done, but will work it out in PMs! Currently I am using stock of 1x4 Poplar but am  looking to get some more exotic woods in my next run. I just need your keyboard measurements and I can make a perfect fit wrist rest for you! (note: Not all wrist rests will look the same as wood grain varies a great deal from board to board)

Now to pricing! (shipping is included in all prices CONUS, will price out international if necessary) Feel free to ask me any questions through PM! Thank you!

(I don't really know how much these go for so let me know if I'm off).

\*I was using the yellow RAMA keypuller (which sucks) and one (1 of 2) shift keys got imprinted with the yellow keypuller. I have been rubbing it a little and it has started to fade off very slowly. I am convinced this marking can be removed if one is motivated. There is also a little scratch on the bottom of it though.

***EDIT***: *Thanks for all the PMs everyone, it's been wild tryna pack 3 different parcels so I can send it off tomorrow. Not sure why it's getting so many upvotes when the prices aren't the greatest (literally costs $50-100 for overseas vendors to ship to me), but appreciate it nonetheless! Paypal's limited me because I've had ""suspicious activity"" so probably wont be accepting Paypal til the hold is over.* ***So I'll be looking local for the remaining items***\*. Thank you! P.S Please still PM me if you have any of the listed items in my Wants, I can pay as soon as Paypal lifts my limit!\*"

To make it easier for buyers:

\- Shipping prices in eu generally are 4-15 euros (depends on various reasons (if it untracked or tracked), how big is the package)

\- Shipping prices to usa/canada generally are 20-70 (depends on various reasons, mostly size and weight affects price exponentially)

\- PRICE<60 € is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € for tracked;

\- 60=<PRICE<100 € (or just generally heavy) is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € - 3.5 € for tracked (unless listed otherwise)

\- PRICE=>100+ € items is sent via tracked/registered mail (unless asked otherwise);

\- Shipping to UK due to new regulations increase by roughly 3e (just add 3e to current EU price), but priority is EU > UK > Other.

In the future I may offer lube or soldering services, but I still need 2 trades to go :)

The listed items is easily reachable and I can photoshoot them every two weeks. However I have more items (switches, pcbs, keyboard cases), which is too much work to photoshoot (it is really annoying to do that every two weeks), but you can ask me more options and I may list more items.

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-60 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct. You can write to me with a similar price I offer, however if this is not my offering price, there is much lower chance I will sell item right away or at all. Especially if price is fixed
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay, but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, ask :)*"

Want to find and trade/buy the 99c DeagCaps bean, my GF really liked it and got excited cuz she thought they were up to buy and got super sad when I told her they are not for sale anymore, she has depressive episodes often so such excitement is fairly rare but she still finds strength to take care of the house and take care of me despite having 0 to no energy.
Which is exactly why I will do my damn best to find this bean
Willing to trade anything you see in the timestamps for the bean, can also pay PayPal


KeyLabs Ronin Samurai colorway is for me mainly, should have the authenticity card and the box and everything


GMK Copper Salvun is hard trade for the 99c Bean, this thing is my baby that I myself paid over 200 usd for, and I don't want to sell it unless it's for a bean, unless you are willing to overpay massively so I can use this money to convince someone to sell me the bean :)

Can add the artisans to the keeb or bundles of artisans with a MAJOR DISCOUNT


Not   FCFS, shipment is EXPENSIVE at about 50(for any keycaps, including even single artisans) through Aramex, hence why would heavily favor Bundles, That's also why my prices for single artisans seem to be high but I'm just trying to cover some losses with shipment :("

hi friends, tons of stuff for sale today. liquidating some of my boards and keysets. prices are inclusive of shipping within the continental US, and international shipping is extra. local pickup and cash sales are prioritized along with bundle sales. please PM only, no chats.

note: do not ask me to separate spacebars or novelties from a keyset etc. i will not respond to you. if i want to split them up i will post them up separately when the time comes. however, i am open to selling the RAMAs separately but i heavily prioritize selling them with their accompanying keysets.

\*All switches that come on boards are lubed & filmed. For details on lube, films, and spring weights please PM me.

\*\*All keysets come in original packaging and trays unless otherwise noted.

\*\*\*All boards can be sold with switches de-soldered if desired. I have a FR-301 gun. PM me if that's something you want me to do.

I am looking to either trade the Susuwatari set or paypal+set or just paypal.

All switches are lubed with 205g0 and springs lubed with either 205g0 or GPL 106. All switches are filmed with Deskeys. Tactiles have unlubed legs to maintain tactility.

I have a variety of boards for sale.

~~I have an unknown XT Vint Black board with OG doubleshots. It's confirmed working. They're reasonably smooth, but the caps are the neatest part. XT layout OG doubleshots are very hard to find, and the Enter and numpad + key are thin GMK, before they switched to the thick molding they're known for now. The 0 key has a line through it as well. -Very little, if any yellowing. 100 shipped.~~ sold

I have a Zenith Z150 with Green alps. The alphas have been very lightly lubed to enhance the feel and sound. The caps are shined, (doubleshot ABS) but the switches feel great. 150 shipped.

~~I have an affirmative Model M from Unicomp. The caps have really neat legends. 30 shipped.~~

I have a VERY messed up NTC KB-6251, with Amber Omrons, ZEOS branded. The plate and PCB were swapped in from another NTC KB-6251. The caps are in perfect shape, and are included. The case is cracked on the bottom left side, and I believe about 7-8 switch stems are broken. If you want to try amber omrons, here's a chance to see how they feel and sound. 70 shipped conus.

I have an M0110 from Apple. SKCC Tall Creams. It's in very good shape, and comes with the cable, though one of the clips is broken. You can still insert it just fine though. 90 shipped CONUS.

~~last, I have a Zenith ZKB-2, SKCL Yellows. externally it looks a little rough, but internally it's perfect. The yellows are some of the smoothest switches I have ever felt, easily a 10/10. They're smoother than NOS SKCL greens I've tried. 125 shipped CONUS.~~"

Hey everyone! Trying to clear some of my stock. I have the following for sale and trade. Prices are shipped to CONUS. I'm also local to the Bay Area Peninsula for local swaps. NO CHATS PLEASE. 

* Alpine65 - **trade only**. I have a black Alpine65. The case has been built, but the PCB and Brass plate are brand new and unopened. There are a couple of small imperfection on the inside of the case. A missing pin that helps align the board when you're putting it back together. Can't be seen and makes zero impact on putting it together. I'm looking to swap/swap+paypal for a Space65 CV, Voice65 or Jelly Epoch. Obviously willing to work something out assuming a price difference.

# Keycaps

1. **SA Hyperfuse + Fix Kit $250** \- bought from another mm user a bit ago but ended up with a hyperfuse remix set I really enjoy so time to pass this one to someone else. The fix kit adds the 1-1-2-3-4-4 profile to the as run 1-2-3-3-4-4 that ran with the original group buy. Willing to ship in the JTK max tray for $265.
2. [**NPKC 61 Keys Sunset Blue Gradient Side Print Caps (NOT shine through) $35**](https://imgur.com/1d9R45u) \- Bought from another mm user as part of a bundle. Ended up not using these and want to pass them on. Will ship in a bag. Image is from a recent post but can send an updated photo if requested.

# Keyboards/Numpads

1. [**~~Ducky Frozen Llama Mecha Mini with Cherry Silent Reds $130~~**](https://imgur.com/XT4a2Nh) ~~- bought this new from MK and was surprised at how nice it feels. Typed on for a few minutes before putting it back in the box. Bought this when I first entered the hobby and don't really want to sell it because it is uWu as hell but I can't display it and want it to go to a good home where it will see use. Comes with all of the extra bits that Ducky includes (extra keycaps, cap puller, USB cable).~~
2. **~~YMDK Numpad $35~~** ~~- Frosted Acrylic built with Zealioz 67g v1, soldered, no cable - bought from another mm user built with these switches, but found that I love 3x4 macropads more than true numpads.~~
3. **~~GK21S Dual Mode Numpad with cable and felt sleeve $85~~** ~~- bought from another mm user, arrived with one screw that is either an extra that I have somehow managed to keep track of all these months and/or one of the threaded holes is stripped. Its currently built with unholy bobas but can take them out and sell for $75.~~

# Misc

1. **~~Black 3D Printed 16 Slot Artisan Box with Black Lid $20~~** ~~- bought from another mm user, but if you keep scrolling you will see that I needed a much bigger boat.~~

hi, just trying to sell off some of my old gear, pls comment before pm.

&#x200B;

**Rose Gold KBD67 MKII Hotswap - $300 + SHIPPING**

used moderately for about a year, don't really use it anymore. there are some blemishes on the weight  and on the plate, refer to the album to see. besides those blemishes, the ano of the board itself is flawless. uses a USB C RGB hotswap pcb and pink c3 stabs. can throw in the switches (sakurios lubed with 3203) for $50 more.

&#x200B;

**Matte Black Switch Couture Alice with wrist rest - $300 + SHIPPING**

used heavily for 2 years. uses a USB mini RGB soldered pcb . built with creams lubed with 205g0, gmk screw in stabs with a random durock stab on the right space bar. built with split backspace config. the bottom 3 LEDs do not work as i messed up the soldering on that part, not completely sure if it is fixable. uses a frosted acrylic bottom, comes with a black bottom if wanted to be swapped out. also comes with a wrist rest.

&#x200B;

if you have questions, feel free to ask. thank you!"

Hi All,


EDIT: due to casting too wide of net let’s go with No. 2 TKL, Iron180, and open to 2/65 depending on where value lines up.

I currently have a Chimera/Mizu bundle I am considering moving on from.

**Navy Chimera65**

\- Pretty immaculate minus the start of potentially patina on the brass weight.

\- Navy, Build on FR4 with lubed Durock POM Linears (Milmax PCB)

\- Extra Brand New PCB

\- Extra FR4 Half Plate, Full CF Plate from CK, Full Brass Plate from CK

\- Extra Gold Accents (badge/USB area)

**GMK Mizu**

\- No Shine (I would say the texture doesn't feel brand new however)

\- Base

\- Novelties

\- Spacebars

\- Mizu Koi desk mat

At this time I am **ONLY LOOKING FOR TRADES** (no 65% (unless 2/65) /alice style trades). If I eventually decide to sell the whole bundle I will make a separate post and specify a price. Please note it does not have to be a trade for another complete build. But at this point I am not splitting up the bundle. Be mindful obviously I can not approach this in a FCFS manner."

&#x200B;

Hello everybody,

I am offering a few items for sale today. **I can only ship to Europe/UK**. For anybody in Ireland, local pick-up is possible in Limerick City. Price do not include shipping. The keen eyed among you might notice that there is a full keyboard in the listing. I'd be more than happy to buddle things together. I also added one picture to the timestamps for visual reference.

&#x200B;

**~~60% walnut Case with foam insert.~~** ~~=>~~ **~~35€~~**

~~60% Walnut case from KBDFans. Used for a few weeks. It is in great condition. It comes with two 2mm foam inserts. It puts the PCB slightly above the tray mounting, providing some cushion. It comes with the wrist rest which I never used.~~

**SOLD**

&#x200B;

**Assembled DZ60 keyboard.** => **70€**

The keyboard comes with:

* A DZ60 PCB with 1000Hz polling VIA firmware and 0 ms de-bounce,
* Super lube Lubed Cherry MX Silent Black,
* Screw-in GMK stabilisers with balanced wires, Holee mod and Krytox 205g0,
* Black coated standard aluminium plate with 2.25U left shift.

The layout is ANSI with split right shift and split backspace. The PCB is pretty new, it was bought last months and was soldered on twice. I have never experienced double key registering despite the 0 ms de-bounce. I can revert the firmware to default or just 1000Hz on demand.

**Dye sub PBT Cherry profile ""Ink Painting"" keycaps.** => **40€**

Keycaps from KBDFans, used for about 2 months.

&#x200B;

**Double shot ABS DSA profile ""Dolch"" keycaps.** => **40€**

Keycaps from Pimp my keyboard. Bought a year ago, used for about 4 months. No ABS shine yet.

&#x200B;

**60% Brass plate with foam.** => **30€**

It is a 2U left shift and comes with mouse foam to put in-between PCB and Plate. It was used in one board for about 6 months

&#x200B;

Any question, please let me know. Have a Good Day!

&#x200B;

Hi all, selling a few things shipped CONUS only!

~~93 Kiwis (from defective batch) -~~ **~~30 dollars shipped -~~** **SOLD for asking!**

DISCLAIMER: these are from the defective batch from TKC.\*\*Originally, i bought 103 total, but after checking all of them in a hotswap board, these 93 were the ones that did not have any immediate chattering issues in my testing.  Despite working for me, they're from the affected batch, so I am selling these at a deep discount. Will ship this in the original Kiwi plastic container, so consider this as buying the plastic container at a huge markup and getting 93 free switches!

I have the following Items for sale since I am narrowing down my collection:

\-**Polaris Black WKL B-Stock + some extras: $525 shipped**

It is currently built with L+F 63.5g Hyperglides with Durock Stabs. Will also include a aluminum Half-plate that I had cut, middle foam, and two extra gasket kits. Will ship it all in the box it came in. Reason for B-stock is the scratch on the back that was claimed to have gotten damaged in a trade. KEYCAPS NOT INCLUDED. Not looking to separate plate and gasket kits at this time, unless the board sells first.

\-**NK65 EE Blumen B-Stock: $125 shipped** SOLD

Ships in the original case w/cable. Reason for B-stock is the crack as pictured, but this seems to be the case for most blumen entry editions made. PCB is band aid modded and the stabs are lubed with Dielectric grease on the wires and Krytox in housing. Built with stock NK Silk black switches (still has factory lubed). GreenDoorGeeks plate foam installed between plate and PCB as well.

\-**GMK Hennessy + Decorations kit: $200 shipped**

Used for about a month. Very minimal shine on some keys, but other than that it is in great condition.

\-**ePBT White on Black: $55 shipped PENDING**

No shine on keys, did not come with the novelties (1U hearts and spade keys)

\-**x90 65g Alpacas L+F: $85 shipped** **SOLD**

These were used for about one week then de-soldered off of my board.

I am selling my SM keyboards TKL. It is transparent purple and teal with a copper plate. It has a Hineybush 87a PCB and is finished off with Kailh Box Blacks. It has GMK stabilizers, but keep in mind the spacebar stabilizer should probably be replaced. It works fine but it a bit sluggish and quite noisy currently. The tabs holding the bar in place broke so I had to replace them with a dab of hot glue as pictured. A new stabilizer would fix this issue. If you have any questions feel free to ask. **$160 shipped OBO**

The wrist rests were all made by me and are priced as follows:

Hello all. Looking to change up the collection a bit. All items are shipped conus. 

I am open to the idea of trading the montage for an 1800 layout board, and will be willing to +/- paypal depending on the board. Shoot me your offers. I only want trades for boards in that layout. Please don't offer me your kbd67.

I also attempted to [cut the cf plate to fit a split  backspace](https://imgur.com/a/X2SaYAC), to no avail. Turns out CF is pretty strong, who knew.

Comes with clear stacked acrylic case, pom and brass plates, pcb (read the rest for note on the pcb), and tuned gmk screw-in stabs. One layer of the acrylic has [broken into two pieces](https://imgur.com/a/TiF5Czq), but has no effect on the board at all, and fits back together just fine. One pad on the board is lifted (right alt next to the spacebar, but I have [marked exactly what needs to be bridged](https://imgur.com/a/rEyBCXt) for the switch to work.

Hello, not unlike last year, I have to offload, basically all of my collection. Unfortunately.

All prices include PP but not shipping, that will be determined with your location. I am not going to enforce a strict FCFS. I'd prefer to ship within Europe, but if you are not in Europe we can surely find a way. 
If you are in Europe I'd prefer to use SEPA rather than PP, I think my past transactions prove I am a trustworthy person. If you don't like it, it's not a problem to use PP.

Prices are negotiable to an extent. I sort of really need cash, sorry.

Keyboards:

* TaoBao VE.A clone, in acrylic, with MX Browns - it runs QMK (140 USD)
* ~~Fake CANOE: this came from far far away (from here on mechmarket). It's hot swappable, I won't include the switches unless requested and quoted for. Runs nicely, I've been using it and loved it using Zealios (150USD).  [PENDING]~~

Keyset:

* ~~XDA Oblique - Katakana Alphas, Mod Icons, 40% (145 USD)~~
* DSA Legacy - Black Alpha, Base Mods (Solace), TKL (Solace), Extras (Solace), 40s (Solace) (150 USD)
* DSA Granite Russian kit - this is the ""original version"" - 70 USD (this it not full alpha!)
* a whole lot of DSA Granite (several sets, mixed, there are a lot of caps ) (150 USD)
* DSA Vim caps (25 USD)
* DSA Fallout caps: a collection of 8, both bombs and vaults, in different colors. IIRC 1 bomb and 1 vault are GITD (25 USD) 
* ~~SA Symbiosis R2 - Alphas, Modifiers, Extension and Blue Spacebars kits (250 USD) [PENDING]~~
* ~~SA Symbiosis R2 - CADR (200 USD) [PENDING]~~
* ~~GMK Oblivion + Cadet Alphas + Space bars kit (176 USD) [PENDING]~~

Switches:

* Gat Clear, Gat Yellow, Gat Black (IIRC): these will come free, you either just pay the shipping or I'll put the in the box with whatever else you got
* Zealios: I haven't counted them. If you are interested I'll count them and let you know. Both ~~67g~~ and 79g. I had a look around and it looks like a fair price is around 0.8 USD/switch.

if you are unsure about something, don't choose silence: ping me and I'll try to make more pictures or answer your questions. Same thing with prices: if you really want something but you feel the price is too steep, let me know and we'll look for a solution.

Thanks."

Hey guys, 

Looking to just sell my 7V over the weekend and would ideally like to meet in person. If you’re local to 95117 (San Jose), will drop my current price down $100. If you don’t want one of the plates, an extra PCB, or the PVD badge and I have buyers for those, the price on the Grey 7V will reduce by that much that was sold separately (up to $180 less). So potentially $720 for just the case with no extras doing local meetup. If we've talked/traded frequently in the past, let me know if you're interested and I'll drop the price as well. 

Priority: Local Sale > Shipped

If you can meet locally, I work nights but am free between 4 pm and 9pm daily. Sunday/Monday from 4pm-8am. 

Shipped price includes Paypal fees and USPS Priority shipping (international will have to recalculate). 

Have | Details | Want
---|---|---
7V | Grey case with: 2x PCB, 1x Flex PC Plate, 1x Alum Plate, 1x Black PVD Badge, and included foam with both plates/case. No notable damage on the case itself but there are some very very hard to see light scratches on the weight. Only noticeable if under direct light at the right angle and if you’re looking very closely at the weight imo. Don't recall ever scratching/dropping the case so these seem inevitable. PCBs are also slightly bent due to how the box was packed but I didn’t notice that having any impact on the build. PCBs were tested with no issues. | $1000 Shipped / ~~$900 Local Pickup~~ **Sold at $790 locally without Badge and PC Plate**
7V | Alum or Flex PC Plate + ~~PCB~~. Priority to bundling with the Grey case.  | ~~$115~~ **PC Plate available still at $45**
7V | Black PVD Badge. Priority to bundling with the Grey case. | $65 **Available**

Still after the below items as well if you’d only like to trade.

Will consider splitting but I'd really like to minimise the amount of posting if I can, so I'm (hopefully!) pricing appropriately and pairing 2 boards with sets that appeal (especially the M65-A, Plum is an amazing fit 😍).

The prices below are less than I paid for the bundles in both cases, just looking to recoup most of my own costs. Both include Special Delivery shipping in the UK. If you're outside of the UK we can work something out.

# M65-A

The M65-A is a Cosmos + nylon board with black PVD weight, built with lubed Holy Pandas and lubed GMK stabs. If you take a look at the image gallery it has a small amount of external tiny cosmetic issues that I inherited from the previous owner.

It's built with an alu plate and the original PCB (the rev that can be flashed to QMK) and will also come with the original PVD coated plate (quite scuffed, came that way) and a carbon fibre plate that I had made to convert it to ISO. The original PCBs are hard to come by now, but the board can be used with others if you're willing to modify either the PCB (TA-65 r2) or the case (DZ67 v2 works if you modify the mini USB port cutout).

GMK x Jessica Plum is mounted on the board and is probably as close as a colour match as you can get for a Cosmos. Plum will come in its original box too. It's had some use but shine is pretty minimal.

~~Looking for £500 for the board, carbon plate and Plum.~~

EDIT: sold pending payment

[Album](https://imgur.com/a/teghWBD), [timestamp](https://i.imgur.com/dmCgXK4.jpg).

# Matrix Noah

The Noah is a ""Hades"" colourway board and comes in original box with extra unbuilt PCB and plate. I modified the plate it's built with when I redid it as ISO, since as stock it has issues with some stabilisers when built. The spare plate is unmodified Built with lubed Marshmallows and pink C3 stabs, and it has a layer of felt in the bottom case that _significantly_ improves the sound from stock.

There are no external cosmetic issues that I know of, and the built PCB is flashed with QMK.

SA Bliss comes with the base + ISO kits, minus 14 keys that I'm keeping (all non-alpha novelties) that I use with my macropads. The set has been used minimally because I'm not a huge fan of uniform R3 SA personally.

~~Looking for £450 for the board, all extras, and Bliss.~~

Cleaning house on this one as I can't seem to stop buying new stuff. Also a skydive instructor and parachutes ain't cheap so it's time to diversify my obsessions. ..er, hobbies. Some coveted stuff hiding in here that I'm not looking forward to letting go. Said items are priced accordingly but by all means reach out if you think my price is wrong. BNIB items were likely removed from packaging for inspection and close up. Most items will ship in their original shipping box. Bongos and lats are priced to encourage trading.

Timestamp: [https://imgur.com/a/329ePpS](https://imgur.com/a/329ePpS)

I have a Space65 CV up for sale today. I bought it off another user in mm, but have not personally built myself as my tastes have shifted. Thanks for taking a look everyone!

What's Included:

\- Space65 Cybervoyager in the cream colorway in original box (Like new condition; wiped down after every touch)

\- Forest Green LED badge

\- Forest Green back weight

\- Black back badge

\- Original Graystudios solder pcb (fully functional with all lights working properly)

\- Clear V2 Durock Stabilizers lubed with Krytox 205

\- All original tools as well as board extras (feet, connectors, screwdriver, etc)

\- FR4 plate

This board is perfect to match with GMK Botanical, Kaiju, or Hanami Dango! If you want to purchase the board alone, am looking for **$650 shipped CONUS**. If you want to purchase the board with the extras, I am asking for **$775 shipped CONUS.** These prices are lower than what I paid for them.

Extras:

\- Gold LED badge

\- Ocean LED badge

\- Black LED badge

\- Pink LED badge

\- White back badge

Only looking to sell these bundled together. I am willing to sell separately from the board as long as the board is already sold. I am asking for **$130** for the extras if the board and extras are **sold separately!**

I am pretty quick on replying to PMs only no chat thank you! Local is 95209 and I will discount if local. I am open to trades depending on the board (Vega, Jelly Epoch, etc). I am willing to add Paypal if needed depending! Also am looking for a white Bakeneko (hotswap), but PP would have to be added on your end!"

**I'm not interested in selling at this time**, as getting lucky enough to win any of these raffles is slim already. Selling would mean I don't have one and I'd rather keep these sculpts in my collection, just interested in colors that better fit the themes I'm going for.

Hey all!

I'm back again this time looking to sell a couple of last things as well as looking for a trade for GMK Cafe! I'm looking to try out the GMK version of Café and hopefully there is someone out there looking to try out the PBT version. I've used IFK Café for about a week with no show of shine or wear. If you would like some more photos of anything up close, feel free to reach out. I am mostly looking to trade for GMK Café, but may sell for $200 plus shipping if you absolutely want to buy it. Looking for Cafe base (with cream), bars (extra shots) and alt dark alphas (black). I am willing to put in some paypal in addition to trading for the IFK base kit.

I am also looking to sell a couple of my Jelly Key artisans from the born of forest collection. These are new and unmounted.

The last thing I am selling today is the Mito Godspeed deskpad in Monochrome. This was used for a few minutes and is in mint condition after being washed.

Feel free to reach out with any questions! Comment before PM

Getting rid of a couple of things I've no use for anymore. Note Olivia is in the picture but SO decided she wanted to use it for her board. It is **NOT FOR SALE**.

Bought this in the last drop intending to build for a friend but they wanted a Rekt more, which I also managed to snag. Brand new, never built.

Asking cost ($288.70 USD) + shipping, will compute based on your zip code.

**Atlas high-end ortho**

In mint condition, just built it up once and have used it very little. I just can't ortho. 

Bundle is the board in gray with an extra PC plate and extra PCB.

Plates:

\- Brass universal (from original GB)

\- Teal alu fixed 7u ansi (from original GB)

\-  POM fixed 7u ansi (from original GB) - this plate is kinda defective  due to manufacturers mistake, there are uneven distances between  switches. So it's basically free and can be used only for experiments.

\- FR4 fixed 7u ansi (custom made)

\-  Forged carbon fiber fixed 7u ansi (custom made). I've never built the  board with this plate so I can't guarantee if it works or not.
