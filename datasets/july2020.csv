Really enjoyed my addiction to the hobby that I got into when Covid started but it's time to move on from this. ALL PRICES ARE OBO 

Not FCFS leave comment and PM. If you want a sound test for any of the boards let me know. 

I have spent the last 3 months lubing all of these switches one at a time all except the tangerine V1s have never been mounted or used. I use Krytox GPL 105 to lube all the Springs. I lubed these as if they were going to be my own and didn't intend on selling initially and took about 3-4 hours per tub.

I am selling a 60% tofu acrylic with dz60 underglow pcb with lubed krytox 205g0 and filmed alpacas with gmk screw in stabilizers lubed with krytox 205g0. 7u spacebar layout

I am also selling this 60% keyboard on my very first build awhile back, I tried selling it but decided I didn't have time to go to the post office so I put it on hold, but I am back to selling it.

This 60% keyboard has a rose gold pink case with  62g lubed zilents with tribosys 3203.  7u spacebar layout

Some of the switch housing is broken but the switch still works normally. (seen in picture)

Easy fix if you want to just desolder the switch out .

the shift keys have zeal stabilizers the rest has clip in stabilizers.

The bottom left LED is a different color then the rest, not sure why.

ALL KEYS WORK on the keyboard

A few things to note:

* Everything is new unless stated otherwise.
* Prices don’t include shipping unless stated otherwise.
* Only shipping CONUS for now.
* Pm first.
* Not necessarily fcfs.
* Bundles / trades get priority.
* Prefer to ship in bags. I know that sucks, but it's a lot cheaper and I don't have big boxes that fit GMK sets.  If you really want your GMK Box, we can work something out.
* I'll try to reply to everyone, but if it gets overwhelming I""ll just update this thread.
* Might be open to trades, doesn’t hurt to ask.
* Note that GMK Minimal R2 will run soon with a lead time of 6+ months.
* **No chat requests, please!**

Good evening everyone!

Figured I’d make one more post looking for trades to see if there was anything fun out there to swap for.
At this time I’m NOT looking for any Polaris, Think6.5’s, or kbdfans boards as trades. 
Also, I won’t be trading both satisfaction boards. Once one is traded, the other will no longer be available for trade. 

If you have any questions about anything please shoot me a PM and I’d love to chat with you about it.

~~HB85 - red base with black insert. Case is in great condition with no dings. Will come with 2 builds as well as an extra never used pcb. Build 1 - 62g lubed v1 Zilents with 3204 on a full red plate. These are incredibly smooth. Build 2 - 67g v1 Zealios lubed with 3204 on a red half plate. Excellent sound with this case.~~
~~Trades for other boards.~~

~~Satisfaction 75 - deep ocean blue color built with 205g0 lubed and filmed alpacas on a brass plate. Excellent condition of the case and fully functional with VIA. 
Trades for other boards.~~

Satisfaction 75 - cloud white built with Sakura stems, 60g springs lubed with 215, in a gateron housing lubed with 205g0 on a brass plate. These switches are so good. Fully functional with VIA. Case has a scratch on the lower left under control. I can take more pictures if necessary. 
Trades for other boards.

~~GMK Miami Nights - amazing set. Looks so good in person. 7u spacebar has shine spot on it but the rest of the set looks pretty good to my eye. I’ll play it safe though and just say there is some possible shine starting on a couple alphas.~~
~~$300 or trades for other keyset~~

~~GMK Laser - you’ve seen it, it’s cool :) some shine is beginning on a few alphas but rest looks and feels pretty good. PSA: This set is available on Drop I believe until tomorrow if you’d prefer to get it there. It’s probably cheaper there as well if you don’t mind waiting a few (possibly many) months for it to be delivered.~~
~~$185 or trades for other keyset~~

That’s all for today :)

Hope you are all doing well and staying safe. 
Have a great day!","[US-NY][H] HB85 with extras, 2x Satisfaction 75’s - 1x cloud white : 1x Deep ocean blue, GMK Miami Nights, GMK Laser [W] Trades"

Hey MM Looking to trade my lightly used MT3 Serika kits. I have Katakana, Modifiers, Geometries, Arrows, and Novelties. Caps are in awesome condition I've just decided that the MT3 Profile isn't for me.

Hey mechmarket, just looking to source some trades and see what's interesting!

* Kn2.10\^2 - Ewhite top, full alu black plate, Ewhite bottom. Polyfilled, running a dz60 hotswap with 205g0/dielectric durock stabs. The brass weight is somewhat tarnished, so keep that in mind. Includes extra desoldered (no pads lifted!) fixed layout PCB also running 205g0/dielectric durock stabs. The Ewhite top was not custom done, it was part of a small extra stock run alongside the GB. The color I have was not originally offered during the GB and the Ewhite top is one of a few out in the wild. In addition, I have 205g0 lubed, TX Filmed, Spring 105 lubed, Silent Ink v2s I'm happy to throw in.
* GMK Minimal - Base kit, I am the second owner. I tried my best to get good photos of shine but because it's white it's really difficult to do so. I can say that it's quite shined, with vowels and gamer keys well shined and less used consonants just somewhat shined. Please note there is a manufacturing defect on the ""0"" key that I have taken a picture of in the timestamp.
* GMK Nines - R1 base (OG Tray), Opened, only numbers mounted very briefly, pristine. Includes sealed accent keys
* GMK 9009 - Base kit, Opened, no shine. Mods and spacebar have been mounted for around a week, alphas were mounted briefly for photos and put back in the tray.
* GMK Modern Dolch R1, includes Base, Spacebars, and Icon Mods ALL SEALED. not looking to trade the one for keysets, only looking to trade towards boards with some heavier offset depending on the board and its condition. (Timestamp is all the way at the bottom)

**In terms of trades for the board, I'm looking for mid-high end 60/65's, but really I'm open to a large variety of sizes. I was hoping for some kind of 1:1 with the option of throwing in a keyset (or two!) with some offset on your end, but am happy to add paypal for some higher tier boards.**

**For keysets, I'm looking for GMK Striker, GMK Shoko, and GMK Mizu with offset on my end for 9009 and Minimal, and hopefully 1:1 for GMK Nines. For the most part, not much else, but I'm always open to offers!**

Hi all,

In the process of liquidating most of my collection -

I currently have a Percent Canoe Gen1 in Ocean colorway for sale.  It is built on an aluminum plate with filmed Tealios lubed with 205g0, C3 teal stabs.

Hi everyone,

I no longer need either of these items. Had the keycaps as a temporary solution before getting my hands on a GMK set. Used them for about 2 weeks. The springs are brand new and decided against spring swapping since I liked the original spring weight of switches I got.

Asking for:

* ~~$55 - EPBT WoB ABS Keycaps + shipping~~ **Sold** for asking

* ~~$15 - TX 65g springs + shipping~~ **Sold** for asking

Sticking with CONUS shipping only. Please PM if interested or if you have any questions. Thanks!

Edit: Update, getting quite a few messages. Sorry for the delay, I'm waiting for a chance to review them once there's a break in the work day. Thanks for your patience!

Hey guys, looking to get rid of things laying around my house since it’s getting a little too cluttered now with everything coming out.

**GMK 9009** \- Brand New and Sealed. *$215 Shipped* SOLD FOR ASKING 

**Anne Pro 2** \- Modded with Silent Gateron Yellows lubed with Krytox 205. Comes with original cable. I don’t have the regular black bottom keys or case so everything you see is how it’s going to come. Has some self-liner inside also. *$80 + Shipping* PENDING 

**~~ePBT Dolch ABS Doubleshot~~** ~~- Used for a couple of weeks. In great condition.~~ *~~$55 + Shipping~~* SOLD FOR ASKING

**70x Aliaz 60g** \- Was previously on a hot-swap board for a couple of weeks. This was the first switch I ever lubed so they may feel inconsistent. With that being said, tactility isn’t very present. Lubed with Krytox 205. *$35 + Shipping* SOLD FOR ASKING

**63x Gateron Reds** \- These were desoldered from the Anne Pro 2 listed above. These were horribly lubed as I tried to lube them while they were on the board ( I know, stupid of me but I wanted to try something new). Honestly will just throw this into whatever order if someone wants them.

Hi MechMarket, I recently build a keyboard, hearing so much about how good Zealios are, I figured I should give them a try. Long story short, I don't dislike them, but there's more switches to find and these are not my type of switch, so I'm selling this one to fund new builds.

About the build:

The build consists of a Readson kit (black plastic wraparound case that screws in from the bottom, black alu plate, PCB (soldered), platemounted stabilizers and blue LEDs as CAPS/scroll lock indicators) paired with Zealios V2 62g switches. The build is soldered, the stabilizers are lubed and the switches are stock. The USB Cable is not detachable (which I only found out upon receiving the kit), but does come with a nice velcro strap.

I'm looking for €150, or €180 with the XDA caps in the picture. Offers are acceptable, both trades and money.

Shipping costs using PostNL:  
NL: €6,75 tracked, €8,45 insured  
AT, BE, DE, DK, ES, FR, IT, LU, UK, SW: €9 regular, €13 tracked, €18 insured

After 6 months of using primarily the Alice layout, I've picked up a few boards with more standard layouts and would like to standardize back to them. I would use this layout for all my boards if possible, but buckling spring and topre call. I'm not super interested in trades, but if I get a good offer I'll consider unbuilt / built with 70g+ linears 60-75%

1: ~~Matte black switch couture Alice, white pk pcb, lubed Durock stabs, rumi's vint blacks lubed with 3204, purple tx films, 72g spirit springs. Perfect condition, has been my linear daily for a few months. Only ""flaw"" is that there are no leds installed. I initially soldered them in backwards, and when removing them to flip the orientation one of the legs broke. The pads are fine if you have new leds to solder in but I don't have spares that fit. $420 shipped without keycaps, $500 with GMK WoB. Note on WoB, one of the left shifts has a minor molding error, as can be seen in the last picture. It was otherwise purchased new from drop a couple months back and in good condition. I can also throw in an additional 20 vint blacks modded to the same spec for $20~~ SOLD FOR ASKING

2: ~~Frosted switch couture Alice, purple pk pcb, lubed Durock stabs, 67g Aqua Zilents lubed with 3204. Also in perfect condition, was my tactile daily for a few months. $420 shipped.~~ Handarbeit not really for sale.

I am on the hunt for a Hammerworks 65/75% CRP Kit. Shoot me a pm if you have one to sell me. Honestly, I am willing to buy whatever keys you’d be willing to sell, not even the full kit.

Hi, today I am looking for a premium 75% board, feel free to shoot me what you have to offer, and maybe I can offer a board + cash or vice versa. I have some artisans I can timestamp as well to include in trade, I will add those into post if needbe before doing any sort of negotiating. If you want or need more pictures, let me know.

Some details- The koyu is clean, hotswap PCB, with a rama cable. Comes in original packaging. No dampener, just stock. Is currently built with amber orange everglides factory lubed, and GMK calm depths. I will probably take off the keycaps at very least if trading. It is RGB.

The clueboard is a solid starter board, no issues except for a couple small knicks on outside, I included a picture of the big one. There is another very small one I couldn't even get a picture of it's so small. There is RGB around the outside of the board, with some shining through ontop. I have a mini-usb cable i can include. Keycaps are included with this one, and it's built with lubed TTC Gold V2 reds.","[US-NH] [H] Clueboard 66, Rama Koyu [W] Premium 75% board"

Item|Description|Price to CON-US
:--|:--|:--
~~GMK Mitolet~~|~~It's such a pretty set with a deep, rich royal purple and electric blue legends. Only reason I'm letting it go is because I finally got one of my highly desired GMK sets and I did not want to put this on my secondary budget build. Est 2-3 weeks of use, so practically zero shine. This will be bagged because the previous seller did not give me the tray for it. Pretty much trying to make at least 90-95% back of what I paid for this.~~|~~Asking price: $200 Shipped to CON-US or Best Offer, $190 + Shipping for International buyers. I can partially discount this in favor of a trade (for the Eclipse accents or *interesting* GMK Novelties). - Buy Priority: Buyers offering GMK novelties or Eclipse Accents > USA/CAN Buyers > International Buyers~~
~~Novelkey PBT Vaporwave~~|~~This was going to be my set, the one. Until I decided to take the plunge and dive into the very expensive GMK sets since I already made a very expensive keyboard build. And because of that, this is **completely unused**. Probably one of the prettiest PBT sets I've laid my eyes on, unfortunately the Vaporwave colorway (GMK or PBT) isn't for my taste.~~|~~$105 Shipped to CON-US, 95 + Shipping for International Buyers - Buy Priority: Buyers offering GMK novelties or Eclipse Accents > USA/CAN Buyers > International Buyers~~ Sold to /u/AsukaLSoryu1 via USPS to Canadian Post
~~70x Gateron Yellows without no Spring~~|~~**N O _ S P R I N G S**. I repeat, THERE IS NO SPRINGS. Yeah, I know, the springs are one of the best parts of a Gateron Yellow so trying to sell these might be seen as a joke. But I got a trick up my sleeve.

Better late than never to do some Spring cleaning. Trying to sell some items that haven't seen much use lately so they can get in the hands of someone that will appreciate them more than me!

A couple of notes before the meat and potatoes:

* I will be covering shipping to the CONUS, the price you see is the price you pay
* This is not a FCFS sale, I'll be entertaining all offers and prioritizing those that buy multiple items
* If you have any Milk or Warm Milk Nightcaps, lets please talk.
* Please comment before you PM be that way I know you're legit
* Discord is easier for me if it's easier for you! jackcauliflower#6773
* I hope you all are doing well! I know that (at least here in the US) things are really crazy right now. I wish you all safe health and that things are going well for you and your families and friends.

[https://imgur.com/a/CDYvj53](https://imgur.com/a/CDYvj53)

Hi all, took me some time to make this decision due to the great typing feel of the board, but the board is just too big for me, and I don't see myself making much use of it.

Currently built with C3 tangerine stabs and Tangerine V1 switches with Tealios tops (lubed, filmed, 60Slow springswapped). I plan to take the switches out, if you don't like the stabs I can take those out too. considering the quality of the plate and the rama switch-puller, I'm pretty confident I can take them out without damaging the plate at all.

**This is what you get:**

* Rama U80-A Kuro Hotswap (including the rama cable etc.)
* Internal Dampener
* Built with C³Equalz Screw-in Stabilizers
* Tracked & Insured Shipping

**Optional:**

* Tangerine V1 switches with Zeal tops (other tops were more scratchy). SpriT 60G slow springs, filmed, lubed with 205g0 (105 on the springs)

Price: €900 including shipping within Europe and paypal fees. **EUROPE ONLY** for now, paid a hell of a lot of money to customs, and wouldn't want that to go to waste.

Please comment before PMing

Wishlist: please don't ask me to trade for your 60% (I don't like the layout), I am also not interested in integrated plate builds. If it's not on the below list, I probably prefer cash.

Hi all! I've got some spare sets that are currently (and soon to be re-) running. For that reason I am selling these at group buy prices. This is especially good value to Europeans because you avoid the expensive import fees, and of course you get your hands on them immediately!

If you've already ordered GMK Laser Gaijin on Drop, you can still cancel and save time/money here. Note that R1 does not include a 7u spacebar, Synthwave backtick/backslash, or the extra B key.

SA Oblivion is being re-run next month but crucially there won't be any ISO/UK support so here is your chance to grab this kit. Ideally I want to bundle SA Oblivion together, but I know the Filco Minila is a bit of a unicorn layout. So to encourage this, I am willing to sell my Minila Air (ISO-UK, Cherry Brown) for 50% off RRP. I don't really want to sell it because good Bluetooth boards are hard to come by, but I hope that's an incentive!

GMK Laser has been used lightly on a backup board but there is no shine. SA Oblivion has been used even less and mounted on another backup board. XDA Canvas are unused spares. Everything shipped in bags apart from GMK Laser which comes in a tray (no top).

Just to be clear, I am happy to ship worldwide too. All prices exclude shipping. Priority for SA Oblivion is: Bundle > Bundle + Minila Air > 3+ Kits.

Hope this helps someone!

Hi all,

I'm looking to sell my remaining artisans, would **highly** prefer to sell them as a bundle!

Check out the grid picture to see what is what. Prices per piece;

A-B-C-D = 1-2-3-4-5 > All €20 / $25 each

E 1-2 > €50 / $60 each

|D|SOLD|coz doggo|coz robear|coz robear||
|E|no idea what's it called :P|SOLD||||

&#x200B;

I'll repeat, €250 / $300 for all!

* Prices include pp fees, do not include shipping
* Highly prefer to sell within EU but for the bundle I will consider international shipping. Due to the bundle priced to go, shipping internationally is on you
* Artisans are hand-made and therefore none of them are perfect
* Dollar is low at the moment, sorry US buyers, nothing I can do about that :(

I'm open to trade them for a keycap set. Interested in GMK only. Oblivion, Shoko, Burgundy, Denim. Anything grey/black/beige. I like boring colored sets :P

Please reply here and send a PM after, no chatting MSN was popular in the 90's but not anymore.

Thanks for looking!

Cheers,

Holy mackerel I didn't expect the Nautilus to be such a hot commodity. In an attempt to be fair I number generated who to give it to, and congrats to /u/KessKielce for winning the sweepstakes.

Second attempt at selling this bad boy, selling because I prefer SA profile over GMK, the keys were used for all of one week before I came to this conclusion, the most minimal wear and tear ever 😊 

**SA Grand Budapest**

Honestly, my pride and joy, I never got around to actually building the board needed to appreciate them properly. As they've been sat in my draw unused for the better part of a year and a half, I evidently don't need them. Again, minimal wear and tear 😊

Greetings r/mm

I would like to start with a phrase I stole from /u/japanesehorrorwriter; **do not flip.** you are my friend. if you flip anything here you are no longer a friend. it's that simple...

I will add to this by saying if you buy these inks to lube, film, and resell them you're also no longer a friend. no one wants your crap lube job thx.

With that out of the way, I'm clearing some parts that are taking up room and I don't have much use for anymore. **If you don't see a price, it's not for sale.** Prices are shipped in CONUS, I will only ship to CONUS (pls no proxy I'm not liable for their mishandling), not FCFS, and I WILL prioritize bundles over individual sales.

~~INVYR UHMWPE Stems (x100+, i forget exact) - $35~~ SOLD for asking 

~~Gateron Ink V2 (x100ish) some from a recent batch, some from april (about 70/30 split), they were scratchier sounding than I liked, they felt alright just sounded meh to me - $75, I WILL ALSO TRADE + Cash for Milkshake colorful deskpad~~ SOLD for asking

brace yourself for the essay:

KBD8x MKII; PC top EWhite bottom, it was a b stock unit from the original GB. The only damage I noticed was some scratches on the weight on the inside, the plate was not completely filed down on one of the switch holes, so I filed it open, and visible machining marks on the outside of the weight. When assembling, they shipped screws that were to short, so I used some longer screws. I poked up the PC a little bit because of this, I have used slightly shorter screws so they're not poking at the end of threads anymore, but it did leave a ""pimple"" on one hole. It is built with holy trash pandas with ThicThock MP64g springs switches and springs lubed with 3204, on brass plate, GMK Retool stabs lubed with 205g0 and wires filed (they're not great but they work) 1 layer of shelf liner behind pcb. - I'm looking for trades for nice 60%'s (aluminum, **NOT** tray mount) or swap for a full aluminum 8x mkii. I would consider trading tops/bottoms to get a uniform material board. No cash price at this time as the market is highly volatile and people are paying way too much for these and I do not feel comfortable taking advantage of the market. ethics and golden rule stuff amirite.

Comment before PM, chats will be ignored, no the H1's are not for sale I decided against it. Go buy some nk silk/dry if that's what you're looking for, don't get the same thing from here for more money.

Hi all, thinning the herd and I now have a Clueboard Low Profile for sale:

* Really nice hotswap board. Incredibly solid, weighty feel.
* Brass standoffs installed; aluminum (silver) set included as well.
* Powdercoated with ""Black Iron II"", a tough coating with a bumpy texture, very nice to touch.
* Stabs included (I think they're GMK, don't totally remember. Will remove if you'd prefer)
* Custom ash wrist wrest with felt bottom included free--can leave out if desired. It's somewhat tall and you might find with works better with high profile keysets such as SA or MT3.

~~Not FCFS. I’m prioritizing trades in the CONUS and Canada.~~

&#x200B;

~~For sale is a beautiful Rama M60-A Sage. comes with back weight, internal dampener, GMK stabs, and original box.  The condition is fantastic. The board has very slight, small nicks on the bottom right hand corner and a small scuff on the top left corner. All blemishes are hardly noticeable when the board is in hand. I tried to capture the blemishes as well as possible in the link above. The back weight is also in fantastic condition.~~

**Cables**

All are made by me, with a 7"" coil and a 4' cable unless otherwise noted, type-a to usb-c. For a couple extra dollars I can swap the usb-c for a mini-b. I can also swap the heatshrink on any of them if you are interested in that as well. Lemos are *4-pin* and are legit. Can verify them for anyone wanting to see more proof.

Hi all, took me some time to make this decision due to the great typing feel of the board, but the board is just too big for me, and I don't see myself making much use of it.

Currently built with C3 tangerine stabs and Tangerine V1 switches with Tealios tops (lubed, filmed, 60Slow springswapped). I plan to take the switches out, if you don't like the stabs I can take those out too. considering the quality of the plate and the rama switch-puller, I'm pretty confident I can take them out without damaging the plate at all.

 

**This is what you get:**

* Rama U80-A Kuro Hotswap (including the rama cable etc.)
* Internal Dampener
* Built with C³Equalz Screw-in Stabilizers
* Tracked & Insured Shipping

**Optional:**

* Tangerine V1 switches with Zeal tops (other tops were more scratchy). SpriT 60G slow springs, filmed, lubed with 205g0 (105 on the springs)

Price: €950 including shipping within Europe and paypal fees. **EUROPE ONLY** for now, paid a hell of a lot of money to customs, and wouldn't want that to go to waste.

I understand Laser R2 is running. What is shown is what you get, have had some weird questions before so thought I'd state that.

SOLD Drop ALT HP + Lubed/Clipped stabs w/Die-electric grease + x67 Lubed box blacks with Krytox205 + x87 leftover Unholy Pandas and Optional Taihao Grey/Dark Grey set, not the Black caps pictured; barely used ALT and save some lubing efforts = $250 shipped Conus SOLD

GMK Jamon Base + Pata Negra + Numpad = $300 shipped Conus

SOLD GMK Laser 65% + GMK Laser Round 1 Blocknet, dreamed to own this for a long time and was satisfied with the pics but I'd like something else to better match my green peaks module :/ = $125 + $100 = $225 shipped Conus if bought together. 65 kit would be $140 shipped alone and blocknet would remain $100 shipped alone. SOLD.

SOLD Round 1 S-Craft Starters; Squirtle, Charmander, Bulbasaur  = $225 shipped for all three. SOLD.

Shipping will take a week longer in addition to normal Conus shipping times, will be coming from an AP (Military) address and is considered normal stateside shipping through USPS.","[US-AP] [H] GMK Jamon + Pata Negra + Numpad, GMK Laser 65% + Blocknet + S-Craft OG Starter Set [W] Paypal, Leaf60 Gaskets, HHKB Pro Classic"

Hey there! Thinning out my collection a bit. I'm gearing up for a new PC + Monitor build and it's not going to be cheap. 

~~**Iron 165** - A Stock - Charcoal~~ SOLD

2x PCB, 1 Brass Plate, 1 POM Plate, Case + Everything else that originally came with it. 

Never been built, or even taken out of case. **2000**

Nice 60% starter build. Very similar to MD ALT, except it's a 60. Built with a DZ60 + Zealios V2 67g + Lubed GMK Stabs + Aluminum Plate **155**

**GMK Metro Bundle** 

Base + Signs + Midnight + Deskmat

I ran with a midnight setup for maybe 3 weeks, ended up taking it off because I hate typing on GMK. Very little use, no shine. Most of base has never been used. Prefer to sell at package but if I don't get any bites on the bundle I will consider parting out **480**

Hi again! I've Upgraded to a TKL, so I'll be offloading this keyboard and a few things today. Also hoping to sell to maybe fund a trip for Keycon in September.

* 65% Built with Alpacas (Lubed & filmed + 62g sprit Slow springs) & lubed Zeal stabs
* Condition is a solid 9/10 as there is a small mark on the top end of the keyboard. Anodization remains beautiful nevertheless.
* Comes with original premium boxing
* Built by lightningXI, check out his typing test [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVZbc9S8fys&t=18s)

**Info: Not the full set but only 3 keys ""missing""**

**SOLD**

Hi everyone,

I am selling an incomplete GMK Pretty in Pink set. I took the three keys to finish my board and the rest is lying around here and will never be used. 

What's missing from the original set:  
\- ISO Enter key  
\- 7u Spacebar  
\- Regular Esc key

All keys for sale were never added to a keyboard.

If you want to equip your regular ANSI 6.25u Spacebar board with some nice pink accents, then maybe this is the perfect thing for you.

Giving them away for a fair price so someone could also enjoy those keys and they don't lie around in the corner.

Price: 40 EUR + shipping

Shipping depends on what you want. Untracked in a bubble envelope would probably something around 2,50 EUR worldwide.",[EU-DE] [H] GMK Pretty in Pink (Leftovers) [W] PayPal

Recently joined a bunch of GBs so I'm letting go of some of my stuff to balance it out.

~~**Rama Koyu in Haze:** Pristine Condition (No scratch, no ding). Hotswap PCB, most of the accessories still in bags. This has mostly been my show piece. Haven't actually typed on it much since the long WFH period. - Price: $875~~ SOLD

~~**RAMA Internal Dampener:** Great condition. Has been in the Koyu since built. - Price: $50~~ SOLD

~~**GMK Sandstorm:** Basically new. Bought to match the Koyu and barely typed on it at all. - Price: $265~~ SOLD

~~**69x NOS Vintage Blacks:** Lubed with Krytox 205g0. Extremely smooth. - Price: $120~~ Decided not to sell anymore since these are just too good.

**Rathcaps BLM Poliwrath:** Doesn't match my theme anymore so I'm selling. Mounted once. To stay true to the spirit of this cap, I will also donate a portion of this sale. - Price: $100

Not FCFS. At the moment I will prioritize bundle. Also keep in mind that I won't be able to ship until Monday due to work reason.

Feel free to reach out to me with any questions. And please comment before pm as usual!

Stay safe guys! And have a good night.","[US-MA] [H] Rama Koyu Haze, GMK Sandstorm, 69x NOS Vintage Blacks, Rathcaps Poliwrath BLM [W] Paypal"

Hello friends!

Since I ordered a new keyboard that should be shipped soon, I wanted to go ahead and sell my newly assembled Tofu 65 I recently built thats ready to be shipped.  Perfect for that user who is looking for a custom pre-built and ready to rock and roll after sourcing some keycaps.

I love how the keyboard came out and want to keep it but I'm trying to start a YouTube channel (with keyboards being a part of the content), and Id like to be able to purchase more boards to provide video to viewers.

Case - KBD Fans Tofu 65 in Black Aluminum

PBC - KBD Fans KBD67 rev2 w/ bottom LED illumination (soldered version) USB Type-C

Plate - KBD Fans 65% Brass Plate

Stabilizers - GMK Cherry Stabilizers clipped and lubed w/ Dielectric grease

Hello and welcome to my Mechmarket post for my PC Canoe!

This specific specimen has pretooled GMK Stabs, Tealios v2 lubed with 205g0 and filmed with ink tops. There are novisible scratches on the board, it's in perfect condition. It's one of my favorite boards but I want to offload most of my collection to get some more high end stuff. Otherwise I would not be selling the board.

The kits in question for the SA 2600 I have are the base kit, non-standard, iso and 660 kits.

I am bundling this together with all kits I have for Maxkey 2600 SA and selling it for a total of **515 USD + Shipping (prefer within EU due to Covid-19)**

&#x200B;

Hi all, took me some time to make this decision due to the great typing feel of the board, but the board is just too big for me, and  I don't see myself making much use of it.

Currently built with C3 tangerine stabs and Tangerine V1 switches with Tealios tops (lubed, filmed, 60Slow springswapped). I plan to take the switches out, if you don't like the stabs I can take those out too. considering the quality of the plate and the rama switch-puller, I'm pretty confident I can take them out without damaging the plate at all.

&#x200B;

If cash, price will be 950 EUROS including shipping within Europe and paypal fees. EUROPE ONLY for now, paid a hell of a lot of money to customs, and wouldn't want that to go to waste. If you would like my switches with it, that will add 50 euros.

\*the GH60 was kind of experimental, I used Superlube OIL on the Blueberry switches because I hated them so much. The brass plate was received in a trade and already stained/damaged. Overall works well, is beat up and ugly. You can desodler the switches and use all the parts or just plug it straight into a extra Tofu 60 you have laying around.

\*The Matrix Noah is missing the LED bar.

\*The Tofu 60 is in rather ""worn"" shape. Mostly unnoticeable unless specifically looking for wear.

Hello MM

I have had this stuff laying around and most of it has never been used.  At this point I need to use it or get rid of it and decided I would rather have the cash.  I have attempted to base the prices based of previous comparable sales but am open to offers via PM.  Prices include fees and shipping unless marked +Fee and/or +Shipping.

\*Trades will take priority on these two caps, hence the slightly over valuing on my part. If prices are way out of line please let me know.

Prices include all fees and shipping CONUS, I'd prefer not to ship internationally but PM if you want to discuss. Discount of $5 per extra cap if buying multiples.

Currently only looking to trade for Pyros (as far as artisans go), mainly after the following using this pic ([https://imgur.com/a/EFVfyNq](https://imgur.com/a/EFVfyNq)). (A-E = Top to bottom) A3\*/4; B1/2/3\*/5; C1; E2/4 and Amethyst.  I am open to other colorways, though I do already have a bunch.

Other things I may be interested in - DSA keycaps;  Mainly looking for modifiers and Novelty kits but also full sets as well, 2077, Drifter, 2049, Skeletor, Hyperfuse, Galaxy Class. I'm open to others (GMK as well), but prefer ""flashier/unique/cyber-y"" keysets. Artisan display case for  \~25 caps.

If you are interested in any of the caps for trade, but don't have a pyro or other item I'm interested in, feel free to send an offer, or if you have any Pyros you're looking to possibly trade/sell as well.","[US-PA][H]Artisans: Skullthulu, Aerophant, Keybuto, Pyro, Gulp, Qoala, Alps switches [W] Paypal, Pyros, DSA sets, offers"

Selling two items -- I can sell separately or together.

*Paypal* \-- Prices are after the goods and services fee (I'll take the hit on those)

*Venmo* preferred -- ( not sure if there's a fee for venmo but same deal there, I won't make you worry about the fee )

*Shipping* \-- I'll pay for shipping up to $20/ea

Items:

**Keebio iris rev 4** \- $200 w/ out keycaps -- $220 with keycaps

\- Cherry clears (NOT lubed)

\- Rotary encoder on left side

\- white led backlights

\- FR4 plates w/ clear acrylic mid-plates

\- Blue TRRS cable ( I'll add in a second one for $5 )

\- YMDK DSA ortho linear keycaps

**KBD67v2** \- $280 w/out keycaps -- $300 with keycaps

\- Novelkeys cream switches (lubed)

\- TOFU 65% aluminum case with brass bottom insert

\- Brass plate

\- white led backlights

\- GMK screw-in stabilizers ( lubed with bandaid-mod )

\- Small scratches in Brass weight -- Photos make it look worse

\- Keycaps are BOSSI PBT keycaps from amazon

Couple notes:

\- On the iris the '1' key LED is out but I can fix that before I ship it out

\- On the KBD67 the control and caps led are out but same deal I can fix them before i ship it out

\-  I'll also be willing to drop $10 off the price of either if you're  willing to take it without me having to fix the LEDs ( I can put some  extra in the box if you'd like too )

\- I have my own keymaps on these -- I can reflash to default or I can send you the keymap json file if you want to check it out

\- This is my first time selling so if you want any more information // pictures let me know

~~Hi MechMarket community.~~


~~I have for sale a built U-80 HOTSWAP MILK. This is my first real keyboard I waited a group buy for and built myself. However, after building it, I realized I prefer quieter and smaller keyboards.~~



~~It is built with:~~
 
~~- 62g YOK Holy Pandas (forgot what lube used) ($100 if split)~~

~~- Lubed/Clipped GMK Stabilizers (these need to be replaced or fixed)~~

~~-  KAT Milkshake Keycaps (Alphas, mods, specialties) ($200 if split)~~


~~Some flaws I would like to mention:~~

~~- stabs are tuned poorly because im noob~~

~~- bottom portion of rubber feet came damaged/ugly~~

~~- fingerprints from building and I do not have a microfiber cloth to clean it.~~

~~I'm asking for $1400 shipped/$1300 local but willing to negotiate. Prefer selling as a whole but might be down to split.~~

~~Local to Bay Area~~

~~Let me know if you have any questions.~~

~~Comment before PM pls~~

~~edit: formatting, price, and added in information about splitting the parts~~

Vortex Tab 75 w/ silent cherry reds - Bought from [mechanicalkeyboards.com](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/), this was my first project board so I desoldered the whole thing and lubed all the switches with 205g0. Being my first time, I ran out of lube, so those two right-most keys in the top row and the middle 4 in the right-most column are unlubed silent reds. I also clipped and lubed the stabs. I also.. cannot find the keycaps for the life of me. I must've accidentally put them in a box that got thrown away because I've looked for them for hours, so this one doesn't come with keycaps.

Up for sale today is 3 of my keyboards. I'm only selling them as I made a large purchase of a mountain bike I've been waiting on purchasing for quite some time. Now I'd like to recoup the cost of that, and unfortunately that means giving up some other items.

~~1. Kira EXS - Purple top/Black bottom - $950 (Sold for asking) - This is, as far as I know, the only one of these keyboards with this colorway in the world (there may be one with the inverse colors of this). Very limited edition (25 total of these were made), very nice board. It's built with lubed YOK Panda's in the brass plate and the extra purple aluminum plate/PCB is built with pro purples. This will ship in the TX carry case and shipping without the TX case is not an option.~~

~~1. Keycult 1/65 Black/Red - $1900 (Sold for asking)- I never intended to sell this, but sacrifices need to be made. This is brand new, never removed from the package. The seal broke when I was attempting to get the case box out of the shipping box to make sure everything was there. However, I haven't opened the box for the case itself. I did open the accessories box to make sure everything was in it. Will even include the candy! I will gladly take the case out of the box for serious buyers if you so desire. I'm afraid if I do that now, I may just realize that selling the board is a bad idea. May also be willing to trade for a No. 2 Rev 1 as well if someone is looking to get into a smaller board.~~ Thank you all for the interest!

~~3. Exclusive E6.5 - E-white/Black Plate/Black-red weight/Red no text badge - $650 (Sold for asking) - Built with lubed YOK pandas again, this is a very nice board with a very nice colorway to it. Would match any white caps/GMK Metaverse very well. Will again include the Taeha Types TX bag, but can ship in the original box for less if you so desire.~~ 

Keysets are not included with any board, and are shown for example purposes only.

These boards are being offered not as FCFS sales, and priority will be given to buyers with high numbers of trades. CONUS buyers only. Shipping is not included in the asking prices, and each board will be shipped fully insured. This is not negotiable.

Please PM me with any questions, but will not talk through chat. Serious buyers only please. May be willing to chat on Discord once contact is initiated through PM's. Will take any additional pics you'd like as well.

**M65A**

* ~~Black M65A with both nylon bottom. Polished brass plate.~~
* ~~Spare aluminum bottom. Both bases come with feet.~~
* ~~Spare brass weight since the one on the board is scuffed. New weight has never been mounted and has sat in the paper wrapping since purchasing~~
* ~~Built with vintage blacks that were lubed with thick lube from Zeal and swapped into zealio housings. Springs were also swapped to Originative 24k 62g springs. All housings stickered with red stickers from Techkeys. I swapped them into zealio housings since some of the vintage black housings broke when I opened them due to being brittle. They're smoother in the zealio housings in my experience. Capslock key has a MX lock switch. I'll toss in some of the extra modded switches too just so you have some spare.~~
* ~~Genuine GMK stabilizers, clipped and lubed with thick lube from Zeal. Spacebar is bandage modded~~
* ~~Extra PCB that has been untouched since purchasing.~~
* ~~Keyboard comes with MT3 Serika.~~
* ~~Issues with the board:~~
   * ~~One of the bottom LEDs is not working. If you plan to use the aluminum base or do not turn on the LEDs like me, then this does not matter. If it does bother you, you can use the spare PCB.~~
   * ~~The bottom left screw used to stick out on the side a little. I have sanded down the bottom of the screw so it's now all flush. If you plan on taking apart the board, make sure you put that screw back in its spot so that the side sits flush again. This does not affect the functionality of the board at all. I also do not think this is an issue with the nylon bottom. It used to affect the aluminum base not no longer.~~
   * ~~Any scratches are circled in photos, found a new one on the bottom that I didn't see before. If there is something that looks like a mark that I didn't circle, let me know and I can take photos of it for you.~~

More liquidation.... I didn't realize how much debt I will be getting into in the future, so this is to circumvent that.

I can ship internationally; just ask for a quote, and total price will be calculated accordingly. Due to current situations, however, it may be prohibitively expensive. If in rare cases of Local Cash, I live at 95472.

I've also listed ""Trades?"" in the title, but I don't really know what I'm looking for myself, so offer away! Interested in getting to customs, but I really am not sure where to start.  Perhaps some customs or switches.

Please ask if you have any questions or inquiries. **Offers are welcomed.**

~~**Alps SKCM Blue x84** \-- Pristine condition. At least a 9/10 from me, no cleaning or lubing needed. Original lube is still good to use. Price is a little high because of that -- if you're looking for some very, very good Blue Alps, this is it. I've kept this thing for a year without being able to find a better batch of switches, if that gives you any reassurance that these are really damn good. **Asking $200 Shipped CONUS**~~ **SOLD**

~~**Cherry MX Black x59** \-- + 1x MX Gray. Vintage, PCB mount. *Good for a 60% with 7u bottom row, ANSI, and 2u Backspace.* These switches were looted from Ultratec keyboards.  These were lubed with 205g0 and filmed with TX films. The springs of the Vintage Blacks are swapped to those of MX Browns (I believe 55-56g) and the Gray has the Black spring instead. Decent switches, but the previous owner has severely overlubed these switches. I've relubed most of them, but 15 of the Vintage Blacks are still overlubed. These will be separated in the packaging. Overall, good switches. If you're looking to a ""ready"" set of Vintage Blacks, these are for you. **Asking $100 Shipped CONUS**~~ **SOLD**

**~~GMK Korean Beige~~** ~~-- New condition.  Never opened, in original packaging.  I bought it from the initial Beige addon hype, but then I realized that I'm no kpop stan and that I have other sublegends I should look for.~~  **~~Asking $90 Shipped CONUS~~** **SOLD**

Hi, I have some things to sell:

1. E-White Tofu60 Hotswap: Instant60 PCB in ANSI layout and brass plate, case is in perfect condition. Comes with Lubed Durock Stabilizers (one of the gold 2u stab wire was lost so I replaced it with a GMK 2u stab wire and works fine) installed - $260 shipped PENDING
2. 87 YOK Holy Pandas (Trash housing, clear stem) lubed with 205g0. I will also include 100 ink black springs lubed with 104 for you to put in the HPs because the stock springs are kind of crunchy (known problem) - $135 shipped
3. 60 Tealios lubed with 3204 (feels and sounds great but I don't like linears anymore), desoldered - $55 shipped

Thanks for looking and have a nice day!","[US-MI][H] E-White Tofu60 Hotswap, YOK Holy Pandas, Tealios [W] Paypal"

Hi mm,

For sale is my *thicc* Tokyo60 with custom stainless steel weight. She's a dense HHKB board coming in at 1.4-1.5kg.

\- Tokyo60 (V1)

\- Custom stainless steel diffuser (also comes with original acrylic diffuser)

\- H60v2 hotswap USB-C

\- MKUltra Foam

\- Zeal stab and 2x2u GMK stabs clipped and lubed

\- Comes with original PCB but one switch bridge needs to be re-soldered (see gallery)

\- Original box

Overall in good condition (take a good look at gallery). Also please ignore my very old wonky table. It took a lot of care and patience to put together and I hope that I find it a good home. Ultimately, I want to start a new project (hopefully a rama m60).

Hello all, this is my first time selling so let me know if there is anything I can clarify. Trying to scrape together some funds for a new build.

|Item|Description|Asking Price|Available|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tokyo60 Keyboard Kit V3 (Gyoen Green)|I got this from the last drop.com release with acrylic diffuser, moderately used, hot-swappable, has base screw in stabs that came with the kit. Comes with base keycap set that was included from drop.com which now has moderate shine  (washed them once, still have that soft dye-subbed feel but at certain angles you can see small scratches on some of the caps and shine spots). Currently have Kailh blue switches (just put in a day ago) that I can leave on or take off depending on what you want, since this keyboard is hot-swappable I have switched them a few times, leaving very tiny (completely unnoticeable unless you remove the switch) scratches in the aluminum plate. I decided to go the VIA route with this board so it currently has the VIA firmware hex file (personally much easier to use then QMK!).|With switches included, asking $200 + shipping OBO. Without switches $180 + shipping OBO.    (CONUS only)|SOLD|
|Discipline 65% V1 (white, no plate) with foam in between back plate and PCB (got from cftkb.com)|Purchased from mechmarket pre-built without switches, I soldered stock NovelKeys x Gateron Linear Glow switches (I can unsolder if requested).  Purple Durock screw-in stabs- wires lubed with Superlube 21030, housings with Kryptox 205g0 (only the spacebar has a gold plated wire because I could not find 2u gold wires at the time of building). Small scratches along the acrylic guard, I did not like the stock angle so I put on two larger rubber feet to give it a more inclined angle. Keycaps that were being used (prefer to sell with!) were GMK Violet on Cream which now have moderate shine on most alpha keys and the spacebar (spacebar has a small nearly unnoticeable scratch on the right side). Set up with VIA firmware hex file as well.|As is (with keycaps and switches), asking $190 + shipping OBO. Without keycaps -$65, without switches -$25.                                  (CONUS only)|SOLD/NO|
|DZ60 Rev3.0 (USB type C)|My first build (,\_,) with an aluminum plate, kbdfans OEM stabs, Novelkeys x Kailh box thick click jade switches, and kbdfans red 5° 60% aluminum case. First thing to note here is I eventually dropped this case on asphalt.... very noticeable indents on two corners and a small amount of paint came off around some of the edges. Inside the case with out the PCB, there are light spots from the under LED's (didn't think this through initially, light leeks through the USB port but other than that it is unnoticeable that there is any lighting on this board). Has GMK Red Samurai that are heavily used- heavy shine on alpha keys and spacebar+ shift keys, moderate to light shine on everything else. Don't want to throw the set away so I would prefer to sell the board with it. Used QMK to flash this one.|Selling as is, asking $175 + shipping OBO ( I will throw the rest of the TKL keycap set in a bag with this). Without keycaps, $140 + shipping OBO. (CONUS only)|SOLD/NO|
|GK GK21S Wireless Numpad Kit (Grey)|Got from Drop.com, bluetooth hot-swappable numpad kit with an aluminum case. Comes with all of the stock stuff (carrying pouch, usb type c cable, manual, original packaging). I opened it to test, currently has Cherry MX Brown switches in it to test and mount GMK VoC keycaps onto. Typed on like 2 times in total for testing, only have had the browns mounted so far.|Asking $75 + shipping OBO( switches I will send for free- they are unsoldered from an old build)    (CONUS only)|SOLD|

* Tealios with sprit 62.5g springs. Lubed with 205g0 (bought these desoldered off of another user 1 month ago)
* Gmk screw-in stabilizers, lubed and bandaid modded
* Keycaps not included

**Note there are some things I'd like to mention.**

I bought this kit from the GB on Keyz.io and this kit is slightly thicker than the design from cftkb's GitHub (or I just made the wrong measurements when sourcing my own case).

Theres a weird gap between the T and R key. I tried fixing it but couldn't get rid of the space. No functional issues though.

**asking $200 + shipping OBO** since it has that T-R key gap.

Vortex Tab 75 w/ silent cherry reds - Bought from [mechanicalkeyboards.com](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com), this was my first project board so I desoldered the whole thing and lubed all the switches with 205g0. Being my first time, I ran out of lube, so those two right-most keys in the top row and the middle 4 in the right-most column are unlubed silent reds. I also clipped and lubed the stabs. I also.. cannot find the keycaps for the life of me. I must've accidentally put them in a box that got thrown away because I've looked for them for hours, so this one doesn't come with keycaps.

~~Ducky Miya Pro Panda w/ cherry reds - Bought this second-hand from a friend, but he opted to keep the panda stuff so this does not have the plushie or the deskmat. Originally had cherry speed silvers, but I didn't like them and tried some switches in the board, but ultimately decided I didn't like the form factor so I put some stock cherry reds in there. The stabs are clipped and lubed, and everything was just cleaned on it as it was a bit dirty from the previous owner. There's a small scratch on the front-right of the case.

Hello MM, I'm looking to sell my TX-84se in sliver as the recent launch of sumi and the upcoming think 6.5 has my wallet looking quite empty. I am not the first owner, nor second, so I can't speak for the keyboards past lives and I've only owned it for 1 month.

**Specs:** This is a TX-84se in sliver, and is built with NK creams that have been broken in for 2 weeks, and then lubed. The stabs are from C3 and the stab housing is red, while the wires are silver. Please note, this sale does not include GMK bento. The keyboard will come with the official TX bag.

**Condition:** I'd give it a 8/10 - the aluminum and keyboard are basically perfect, my zoomer eyes couldn't find any imperfections at all, however, the brass weight has seen better days. It's discolored in the middle and has grown darker - so a polish is recommended. No dents, scratches or anything on the alu, wow! I'm happy to provide a sound test if required, but i own a oneplus so please don't expect tae-level of quality :)

**Price**: I'm not 100% sure how to price this as this is the WKL version, but I've seen the WK version go for \~$800 USD, so i'll set pricing at around that. ***$750 USD + postage*** if you are in another country, I will guesstimate postage should be \~50 USD extra as it's quite heavy (3.5KG I think). Happy to accept other offers, but please no lowballs. Locals will get priority

**Trades:** I am looking for nice 65-75% boards to trade with, something similar to a space65 or the upcoming think 6.5 so I don't need to preorder one of them.

Hey guys, 

Testing a few sets/artisans out and don't think I'll be able to use a few things. Mainly looking to trade off the keysets for things on my wanted list so I don't have to reinforce the absurd aftermarket pricing :/ Might be slow to respond since I'm at the mercy of my mobile hotspot right now. 

Listed price includes Paypal fees and USPS First Class shipping. **Will give priority as: Trades/Bundles > People with a history of wanting the thing > FCFS.** Anything with a price is also for sale. If it's pending, I may still be down to trade and will definitely give it some time to hear out trade offers.

Hey guys, looking to offload some stuff. I am looking to sell one or two of the listed keycap sets and keep the one/two that isn't sold. I got some Alpacas off of the drop so I don't need these tangerines anymore.  I've also learned that my Mars 6.5 cannot compete against the Think 6.5 GB around the corner so, I've decided to sell this at its GB price, alternatively, I would just sell this for any price between $210-$350 and let the buyer choose the price, but I don't know if that is allowed. Dropping off for shipping on Monday.  Anyway, thanks for looking and stay safe.

All prices are OBO. Not FCFS, prefer users with confirmed trades or others I have bought from/sold to. Probably not interested in most trades, but don't mind seeing offers.

**~~Space65: $700 shipped~~** ~~for entire package in original box~~ \- SOLD

* Black aluminum with gray badge
* Side light bar version
* Carbon Fiber plate built with lubed holy GSUS switches with Sprit 63.5g springs
* Lubed and clipped GMK screw in stabilizers
* White enamel infill on the back
* EXTRA unused Brass plate
* EXTRA unused pcb that has not been tested
* EXTRA white badge
* Minor scratches/scuffs in the following areas that I have tried to capture in the photos:
   * tiny dot scratch on top right corner of divider to the left of arrow keys
   * noticeable scratch next to milled planet logo on right side
   * tiny dot scratch on right side of case
   * scratch right above usb port on the back

**~~KBD67MKiiv2: $350 shipped~~** ~~in original packaging~~ \- SOLD

* Rose gold case
* Unused Hotswap pcb and brass plate

The pcb and plates are all brand new and have not been used; the Rose gold case has been lightly used for about two weeks with the rubber feet already attached - I originally bought this kit but ended up not liking the color and bought an identical gray kit and just moved my pcb and plate over to the new case. Case is pretty much in perfect condition - no scratches or imperfections as far as I can see. Rubber feet show light signs of use.

**70x NK Blueberries: $85 shipped** \- AVAILABLE

* 2 have standoffs clipped, rest are entirely unused
* lubed with Krytox 205g0

**Zen Pond II Renriku 2.25u** \- bought from [r/mm](https://www.reddit.com/r/mm/) new, used for a few days but the higher profile bothered me as GMK profile is much lower, looks brand new, comes with original packaging and dog tag - **$80 shipped** \- AVAILABLE

Hey everyone! Got some small things up for grabs today.

I'm happy to chat about bundles!

The CYSM BOOO is only for trade at the moment. I love the little dude, but I couldn't bring myself to purchase ANOTHER GMK set, so I unfortunately I made the decision to miss out on MoDo R2. He doesn't match any of my setups.

I **am, however,** waiting on GMK Redacted, and I am looking to trade the BOOO for the Redacted Keyby - PP can be added on either side if need be. Edit: or **any keyby's in similar colourway** (will be holding out for redacted keyby though)

I'm also still on the search for a 9009 circles deskmat, and my setup is incomplete without it! Please DM me if you are looking to trade or sell.

Just included the graphics card here to see if anyone would like to trade for it :)

Hello MM,

Item | Description | Price

Rekt1800 Navy A-Stock | Excellent condition, no shipping damage. Built with Zilent 67g, TX clear filmed, lubed with Tribo 3204, springs lubed with GPL105. Genuine GMK stabs clipped and lubed with Krytox 205g0. Built with 6.25U plate and stepped caps lock. Will include extra 7U plate, spare hardware, and CK carrying bag. It was my work board, amazing to type on but I just could not get used to the 1800 layout. I will include extra wrap to make sure it doesn't get damaged in transit. | ~~$600 US~~ sold for asking
KAT Milkshake | Looking to sell as a bundle so will not part at this time. Kits include: Weirdo, Modifiers, Fruits, Specialties, Space + RAMA. Weirdo and Modifiers were opened and mounted once, barely used on a board, the rest are still sealed. I'm a big fan of biip but I guess I just can't get used to KAT profile. | ~~$475 US~~ sold for asking

~~SA Pulse Custom Set [Alphas & Text Mods]~~|~~Brought from Massdrop's extra stock and managed to grab myself a solid SA set, both alphas and mods. I was thrilled until it turns out I wasn't a huge fan of SA profile caps, so I'm trying to make even for what I paid for it. Used for about a week in an attempt to adjust to SA and gave up. So I'm 99% certain there's no shine on these. Maybe a SA SP lover looking to collect sets or use this set would be appreciative of this. **Unlike the TKL set this is compatible with MOST keyboards, including 65% and 75% boards with a blocker.

Features a black cord with a bright turquoise double-sleeve, topped off with black heatshrink to finish the look (admittedly, the sleeving is a slightly more vibrant shade of turquoise than in the SA set but it still fits well).

A few things to note:

* Everything is new unless stated otherwise.
* Prices don’t include shipping unless stated otherwise.
* Only shipping CONUS for now.
* Pm first.
* Not necessarily fcfs.
* Bundles / trades get priority.
* Prefer to ship in bags. I know that sucks, but it's a lot cheaper and I don't have big boxes that fit GMK sets.  If you really want your GMK Box, we can work something out.
* I'll try to reply to everyone, but if it gets overwhelming I""ll just update this thread.
* Might be open to trades, doesn’t hurt to ask.
* Note that GMK Bento R2 will run this August.
* **No chat requests, please!**

EDIT: Prices have been reduced.

Hi all,

Looking to sell my excellent condition Tofu60 build. All parts were bought new and it hasn't been used too much. It includes the following parts:

\- Grey aluminum Tofu 60 case

\- DZ60 PCB: USB-C with RGB underglow

\- Black aluminum plate

\- Soldered on NovelKeys Blueberries switches (tactile switches made from POM, a self-lubricating plastic)

\- Clip-in Cherry (GMK) stabilizers, have been lubed with dielectric grease, band-aid modded, and toothpick modded to eliminate rattle

Please note that it does not include the keycaps pictured (MT3 Serika). I'm looking to get $200+shipping, which is around what I paid for the parts and doesn't include assembly labor time.

~~I also want to sell my [set of SA Lime](https://pimpmykeyboard.com/sa-lime-keyset-two-shot/). It was bought new from pimpmykeyboard and includes the alphas kit ($50, no longer in stock), modifiers ($20), and color kit ($7). It's enough to cover a 60% keyboard layout. It's hardly been used at all - perhaps for 2 hours total. I tried out the profile and wasn't a big fan of it. Looking to get $70+shipping for it. It'll be shipped in a bag/box.~~ SOLD

Looking to sell my OSA Sleeves kit, I love the colorway but unfortunately SA Profile is just not for me, gonna have to wait out until GMK Mr Sleeves r2. The set was used for a week, no shine or wear to any of the keycaps. **Looking to sell for $80 + shipping**, $5 below MSRP since they’re still brand new essentially but have some minor use. I can ship in the box or in bags, whatever your preference is. 

Disclaimer: you can buy this set brand new on Novelkeys currently for $85. I’m not looking to sell for profit, just trying to get most of my money back to cover the cost of pbt BoW I bought to replace this kit on a board.

Hi everyone,

I have a Discipline 65 v2 built with Gateron Black Ink switches, lubed with Krytox 205g0, spring swapped with 65g TX Springs, and filmed with clear TX films. I have lubed the GMK Stabilizers with Krytox 205g0 between the plastics, and dielectric grease for the wire.

It does NOT come with CFTKB's foam, but I have some neoprene foam that I roughly cut out and can toss in for free.

Asking for $180 local, $200 shipped. ***SOLD FOR $180 LOCAL***

Edit: Will prioritize local first. Comment before PM.

Also, my batch of Gateron Inks are very recent (purchased around June). I have heard rumors of some issues with recent Gateron Inks and I can confirm from my side. I sorted out the best of what I had on this board, but proceed with caution I guess.

Hey all, got a couple of things I'm trying to sell before I move here in a few weeks. Shipping is CONUS only. If you have any questions feel free to ask!

HHKB Tofu - Sold 120$

Has Box Jade switches for that thick click. Bought from another user here on Mechmarket. Just couldn't get used to the HHKB layout so I'm parting ways with it. Comes with the keycaps pictured as well as the artisan cap. Has a little dent on the right hand side as seen in the timestamp.

Discipline65 - Sold 90$

This board has YOK Purple Trash Pandas in it. It comes assembled in an acrylic sandwich style case with GMK skrew-in stabs that have been lubed and band-aid modded.

USB-C Coiled Cabled - Sold 20$  
Not much to say about this other than the coil part is black with a bit of silver dotted throughout it. Black sheath and silver cable.

I'm also looking for the modifier set of the WinMix Retro beige SA set that was on drop awhile back. If anyone is looking to part ways I would be willing to buy it outright or take some money off the price of one of the keyboards I'm selling.","[US-VA] [H] HHKB Tofu with Box Jades, Discipline65 with acrylic case, USB-C coiled cable [W] Paypal, WinMix Retro Beige Uniform SA MODIFIER SET"

You can buy everything separately or in a bundle, I don't particularly care. The 8008 set's never been used before. I was planning on it; that's why I removed the terrible new packaging. The deskmat is deadstock.

Shipping to EU only for now.

Hi all,

&#x200B;

Selling my IDB60 and a bunch of artisans that I won't ever use again.

Prices you'll see below are based on > *shipped in EU and with pp fees included <*. Shipping internationally will unfortunately cost extra but can be done and discussed. Please keep in mind international shipping is slow.

&#x200B;

**~~IDB 60 - €275 | $315 - SOLD~~**

* Prototype case
* Ceracoated yellow by Salvun
* One small knick on the bottom edge, pointed at with pencil :)
* Comes with 1.2mm prototype pcb (very flexy)
* Comes with the Yellow Salvun escape key
* Build with gateron reds, lubed with 205g0. I can desolder these, price won't change (they're free)
* GMK Griseann NOT included
* NO stabs included, due to stab shortage I want to hold on to these.
* \*TIK ISO enter free for ISO buyers ONLY\*

Bottom prices -WITHOUT- shipping included

A1 - E4 (all tigers) = €20 each > buy all for €200

A4 - D4 = €20 each

A5 = €50

For anyone interested; everything for €300

Artisans priced -way- lower than what I paid for it. But at this moment in time any money is fine for me really. Truth be told; I'm not the biggest fan of shipping single caps so hope someone wants the lot :)

&#x200B;

**""Rules""**

* not fcfs, multiple items in once go have preference and I do prefer to ship within EU (less work)
* IDB price is with shipping included, artisan prices are without shipping
* all prices include PP fees
* obo applies on all prices (or best offer, not or better offer ;) )

Hi everyone,

**~~GMK Wasabi~~** \- ~~only used fo about 4-6 hours total. Excellent condition. Trades.~~

**GMK Nines** \- Used for about 4-5 days. Excellent condition. Trades.

**~~GMK Hiragana~~** ~~- base kit and micons kit. Used for less than 4 hours total. Perfect condition. $225.~~

Have some extra POM plates. Plate doesn't have cut off for standoffs and is made using the files for the solderable PCB. That said you can use it for the hotswap variant as well but it's easier to do with setting up the plate/switches/keycap assembly completely and then mounting it on the board. 
Asking 30 GBP shipped

Have some stock 70 used FFF switches. Mounted two times for about a week. Recolored Durock linear which is the same as alpaca/mauve
Asking 80gbp shipped. SOLD

Stock unused Gateron Black Ink V2 X 80
Asking 95gb shipped

Dark Serika Deskmat 
Asking 70 GBP shipped. SOLD x2

Finally.. ordered way too much of an acoustic sound dampening material. It's 2mm thick, should fit a few cases. It's graded to isolate 26dB with a single layer. It's quite dense and will legitimately add weight to your build as it's reasonably heavy for its size. 
Let me know if there's interest and what size you want for pricing. A rough 60 percent cut out for about 25 GBP shipped. 

If you have a Rama U-80 just let me know condition and if there's extra PCBs or what have you. Name your price. 

Prices are for shipping to EU. Feel free to offer. Prices can be discounted for combining shipping or if you can manage bank transfer to avoid PayPal fees.","[EU-UK] [H] GMK Serika Dark Deskmat / Zambumon Hexagon, Kbd67v2 mkii POM plates, sound dampening material, FFF / ink v2 Switches [W] PayPal, Rama U-80"

**GMK Cafe with cream (standard) and special blends (40s):**

I got those for a build that never actuall happened. Colour is really nice and I was suprised at how accurate they  matched  the renders. If i get an offer for the 40s alone I am willing to split them up as well. Otherwise its **320€** for both. 

———

**Daisy 40%:**

This one I think is really cool. I got this to try out the 40% layout. However usually the daisys arent programmale via QMK. I however followed the [ISP flashing guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/isp_flashing_guide) to create a Teensy that is able to flash QMK onto it. Which makes it really capable. Otherwise you simply wouldnt be able to use features such as TapDance etc. 

The board features Cherry MX silent blacks that I lubed and changed the springs to 45g. This plus some bandaid mods make the board really quiet and thumpy. When you combine this with the tiny size this board is a really great travel companion. I am only selling this because I upgraded to a Neuron.

*Sidenote: You have to be willing to dig into the code a little bit. I  however managed to do this with some time and no prior experience in QMK.*

I am selling this for **90€,** or **80€** without the Teesy if you dont need it.

———

**Vortex Pok3r:**

My first board and the one that got me into this hobby, just as many others. These days it just lays here and gets no use since I upgraded over a year ago. Works just as well as new. This has **MX Browns** in it. It has the german layout!

I am selling this for **60€.**

———

~~**BROKEN Vortex Race 3**~~

~~This looks perfectly fine and the case is intact as well. However the PCB was fried a year ago due to a faulty cable. It does not work at all and the computer doesnt recoginze it as an usb peripheral.~~

~~It does however have **Vintage MX Blacks** in it, all well broken in. I soldered those in from an old Cherrx 1800. They all worked when I last used the board.~~

~~It also has the nice DSA-Granite-esque keycaps.~~

~~Willing to sell this for **45€.**~~

Sold to  /u/Tobsl3r

Hi, I have a Tofu65 hot swap kit for sale. See my previous post for a sound test with lubed and filmed alpacas using cheap keycaps with this kit.

&nbsp;

Item | Description | Price
:---------:|:----------:|:----------:
~~Chocolate Tofu65 Kit~~|~~Chocolate tofu65 kit w/ dz65rgb Hotswap, Brass plate, GMK screw in stabs, Shelf liner, Brass weight under the case~~|~~$260~~  ~~$250 shipped~~ **Sold**


&nbsp;

I will try to be as transparent as possible. Again, if you have any questions or want clarification let me know!

**Chocolate Tofu Case**

* I bought this from another person. It came with 1 missing screw from PCB to Case, which doesn't affect anything.
* There are a few minor cosmetic defects which was there when I received it, all interior: There are a set of circular indents at the bottom right and bottom left. Also, a small scratch near the top which will be covered when you put on keycaps. Lastly, the previous owner used a strong adhesive foam liner which I was able to remove, but it stained the bottom of the case. (again reference picture).
* https://imgur.com/a/Wo4MQLX

**Dz65RGB Hot Swap PCB**

* PCB is in perfect working condition with all LEDs working.
* I currently have Home, Page up, Page down, End as Delete, Volume up, Volume Down, and Volume Mute. I can reset the PCB to original keybinds if you would like.
* The GMK screw in stabs work fine and I have clipped and lubed them with super lube. The space bar rattles a bit if you press on the very edges. I have band-aid modded the spacebar. I believe it's because the bar is bent a tiny bit and the right screw doesn't screw in very well
* https://i.imgur.com/HKnPTWU.jpg

**Brass Plate**

* No defects works perfect

&nbsp;

I can ship it out by today. Local is OC/LA area, and can reduce price if local.

Hi [r/MechMarket](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechMarket/)

Hope everyone is well and safe.

I have a few sets coming in and I have decided to not hold on to this set.

**Selling:**

The price is listed **OBO**.

All prices are OBO. I will be giving priority to bundles - please pm me regarding bundles and we can work out a decent discount. Not FCFS, prefer users with confirmed trades or others I have bought from/sold to. Probably not interested in most trades, but don't mind seeing offers.

**KBD67MkiiV2** \- Rose gold case, hotswap pcb, brass plate, Ponoko POM plate: The pcb and plates are all brand new and have not been used; the Rose gold case has been lightly used for about two weeks with the rubber feet already attached - I originally bought this kit but ended up not liking the color and bought an identical gray kit and just moved my pcb and plate over to the new case. Case is pretty much in perfect condition - no scratches or imperfections as far as I can see. Rubber feet show light signs of use. Entire kit - **$350 shipped** in original packaging. \[SOLD\]

**GMMK Compact** \- barely used, no scratches, scuffs, or signs of use other than light dust - **$45 shipped** in original box with all accessories (switch puller, keycap puller, cable). \[SOLD\]

**SA Bliss** \- used for like 3 days but SA profile was too high for me. Originally bought from r/mm completely new. No shine and I have cleaned all keycaps with a microfiber towel - **$250 shipped** in a bag \[SOLD\]

**Teal Aviator Cable** \- bought from /u/slgerb, who does great work, nice and tight coil, I think total length is about 6 feet, no issues with Drop ALT - **$50 shipped** \[SOLD\]

**Zen Pond II Renriku 2.25u** \- bought from /r/mm new, used for a few days but the higher profile bothered me as GMK profile is much lower, looks brand new, comes with original packaging and dog tag - **$80 shipped**

Please ignore the Varmilo in title and timestamps.

Please comment + pm. Happy to answer questions or provide additional pictures by request.

EDIT: Forgot to mention - I just moved into a new apartment and things are kind of hectic so probably will not be able to ship today or tomorrow. Most likely will end up shipping everything out Thursday or Friday.

EDIT 2: The extra KBD67 plate is actually POM, not FR4 - sorry for the mixup

Trying to really pare down and focus on keeping my collection tighter, as much as I love these boards. Up for grabs are the following:

~~WKL Sirius 60% built with lubed NK Creams (Krytox 205g0) and c3 screw-in stabs (also 205g0). Supremely nice board to type on, just have other things on the way.~~ SOLD
`Asking $400 shipped CONUS.`

~~Key65 polycarbonate with titanium plate, grey key logo blocker, grey weight. Switches are lubed and filmed H1s (205g0) with Sprit 60g ""slow"" springs. Durock screw-ins lubed with 205g0. This is, very honestly, peak Key65 and probably peak 65% in general. Hard to really think of a meaningful improvement that could be made anywhere.~~ SOLD
`Asking $850 shipped CONUS.`

~~Think6.5 polycarbonate hotswap. Will come with GMK screw-in stabs from before the nightmare retool, and some MX blacks I was messing with before life got in the way. Switches have 75g Sprit springs, was messing with them just to see if I liked the weighting, so they're unlubed (but not terribly scratchy or loud).~~ SOLD

From the most recent drop. Mounted on a Doro67 for about two weeks for the wifey's build and she just couldn't get used to it. All of my keyboards are black so it's not going to fit onto any of mine.

Bundle includes:

* Latin Alphas
* Mods
* Arrows
* Numpad

Black arrows from the arrow kit and full numpad kit were never mounted since the doro67 doesn't need it.

**~~Asking $275 shipped~~** sold for $250 shipped (within Canada) in original boxes packed inside another box altogether. US/International may require small additional shipping top up depending on where, US westcoast is probably ok.

Not looking to split. Funds going directly towards hopefully a GMK Olivia set from the extras sale for the wifey to finish the build haha...

Hello friends, this is u/not_son_goku. I am the writer of the post that you are reading right now. I am buying a house and need to sell some stuff. Also I want to buy other things. Way she goes. Only shipping to CONUS. Sowwy global friends. Prices include priority shipping. Not FCFS, priority goes to bundles and people I've sold to before. Here are my wares:

* ~~**GMK Mizu** - Includes Base, Novelties, Space Bars, 40's/icon. **NOT SPLITTING, BRUH.** Set has been lovingly used for around 4 months. Some signs of shine have began on alphas. Will ship in bags. I will not accept a penny more or a penny less. - **420.69**~~ **SOLD**

* ~~**Holy* Gsus x100** - Desoldered. Only the springs were lubed with GPL106. Anyone who's desoldered pandas know they can be a pain depending on the plate. Some of the housings took a beating. All of them still function perfectly fine. - **$108**~~ **SOLD**

* ~~**BKE Redux Heavy Domes x100** - Not much to say about these. Purchased a used fc980c that had them. Replaced them for lights. I would consider a straight trade for ultra lights. Otherwise... - **$78**~~ **SOLD**

PS.I Love you

|~~Zeal60 Rev2 Build with Lubed & Filmed Zealios 67g and Lubed & Modded Zeal Stabs~~|~~PCB works flawlessly, is flashed for VIA, and has brilliant per key RGB light.  I chose Zealios switches and a PC plate to accentuate the RGB, and the effect is excellent.  Switches are lubed sparingly with 3203 (including tactile element) and filmed, while the Zeal stabs are band-aid modded and lubed with Fluorinated Grease where plastic slides on plastic, and Dielectric Grease where metal slides on plastic.  78g Zealios switches were used on the Esc and Enter keys, and a 62g was used for the space bar.~~|~~$200~~|
|~~SA Chronicler Keycaps~~|~~Selected for their sound most of all -- this build is very quiet due to the PC plate, and so these large, thick keycaps result in a nice deep sound with decent volume.  Included footage in the demo video of the same build with GMK keycaps for comparison.  Keycaps are in perfect condition, only used for about 10 hours.~~|~~$100~~|

Hello, i want to selling my first build, my Polaris75 which has been Powder Coated in the process.

I bought the Polaris75 at the time the Seller was busy making masks and pretty much gave me one of his last pieces left in stock, i only had 2 color options, Light grey and Black, i went with light grey. Sadly i wanted to make it fully custom with custom engravings, but maybe it was better so, as i'm already parting ways with it.I'm selling the build because i will be leaving the country for a while and an planing of building a new keyboard at the start of 2021 when i return.

Please don't PM me to tell how bad the paint job has turned out, i know it doesn't look as good as from factory. It was a board for me by me, and it won't be for the majority and i hope i will find someone who won't look at the flaws too harshly. \^\^

# WHAT AM I SELLLING:

**~~Polaris75, Dark Blue - $275 Sold for Asking + Shipping~~**Ireally don't know what to ask for this frankenstein copy.Included:

* Frame- PCB
* Brass Plate
* Acrylic sandwitch layer (sorry, didn't include a picture)
* Cherry MX Stabilizers

**~~GMK Striker Base - $250 + Shipping (EMS to USA around $25) - Sold for $280 + Shipping~~**

* Used

**~~GeekCable Blue - $35 Shipped with Polaris75 Kit~~**

**Switches - Gateron Ink Blacks v2 x80 - $80 + Shipping**

* Not used for soldering
* Are in zipbag
* Lubed with some local lube, got recommended by a friend, after 2 months still hearing the pops.

# MY CHANGES

I'll start with the new Color for Polaris, it is a RAL-5011, i picked it out to match the cable and Striker keycaps. My friend helped me repaint it, he took off the original color and guided me through the process, so it was kind of a fun experience.

* Color (From Grey to Dark Blue - RAL 5011)
* Polished the back weight from the original Grey to mirror finish.
* The Brass plate i opted for had a lot of scratches, so i used a Brown Tripoli polishing compound to remove the scratches (around 2H), which i succeeded (the last image in timestamp) before there was no reflection from the plate, now you can even see yourself, almost :D
* The ''75'' badge on front was polished as well.

# FLAWS

* I'm really sorry for the terrible paint job done on the inside and on the back, at that moment i was like a kid who couldn't wait to get home from the store with his new toy. But if you don't pay attention to that, than it's one hell of a good looking keyboard. If that makes sense :)
* Other flaws are from the factory, the seller had done a pretty bad job drilling screw holes (check images) , but i personally don't care about that, as i understand their situation they were in, with the masks and other things going on and it's a defect you don't see while typing. The holes don't affect the assembly or functions of the frame.
* The mounting plate is a bit tight, some switches need a bit more force to go through, but the PCB has held the force really good, no hotswap issues.

Hi all,

After much debate and thoughts I decided to put two things up for sale. I try to stick to the ""if I don't use it, sell it"" rule, and these two are among those. Somewhat a shame since I like the look of both items.

For sale:

GMK Metropolis - €375 | $425 | obo | SOLD  
\- Base  
\- Signs  
\- Blocks (spacebars)

Not used all that much, never really found a good board for it besides showpieces. Perhaps one maybe two weeks in total and that would already be stretching it.  
NOT SPLITTING THESE UP

IDB60 Proto - €300 | $340 | obo  
\- Ceracoated yellow by Salvun  
\- 1.2mm Proto pcb  
\- Gat reds (non milky), lubed with 205g0. Nothing special here. NO STABS included  
\- I can desolder the switches if you like  
\- Yellow Salvun artisan cap included  
\* TIK ISO enter ONLY included if whoever buys this is an ISO user.  
\* you can check out the typing video to see a different angle of the board

Some ""rules"";  
\- prices included paypal fees, exclude shipping  
\- shipping within EU is around €15 for most countries, shipping outside of EU can be up to $60, 50% of that cost is on me  
\- bundle is possible for reduced price- not fcfs, highly prefer sales within EU

Please reply here first then send a PM (not chat)

Hi, I decided to sell my first build and some accessories. Please read everything and feel free to send me a pm if you have questions!

**Audio test** so you can hear exactly what you will get using PBT fake camping keycaps. I also go through the mods at the end: https://clyp.it/4znl5yn2?token=10cfcf9db4746d41954da27ce034ea86

&nbsp;

I will try to be as transparent as possible. Again, if you have any questions or want clarification let me know!

**Tofu Kit**

* I bought this from another person. It came with 1 missing screw from PCB to Case, which isn't a big deal, and 1 missing washer for the screw in stab. I made a ""washer"" with the shelf liner as you can see from the picture.
* The only scratch I can see is from the top right of the case which isn't visible with keycaps on (again reference picture).
* The owner before me also used a very strong adhesive foam liner which I removed but had to use grease remover which stained the inside of the case. This is only a visual stain and you won't see it unless you have nothing in the tofu.
* All LED RGB works on the PCB.
* I currently have Home, Page up, Page down, End as Delete, Volume up, Volume Down, and Volume Mute. I can reset the PCB to original keybinds if you would like.
* The GMK screw in stabs work fine and I have clipped and lubed them with super lube. The space bar rattles a bit if you press on the very edges. I have band-aid modded the spacebar. I believe it's because the bar is bent a tiny bit and the right screw doesn't screw in very well (Reference sound test)
* https://imgur.com/a/hmDfAEC

**Alpacas**

* I also bought these from a user. They were desoldered by him and barely lubed with Krytox 205g0
* I have lubed over with Trybosis 3204 and added Switch films to all of them.
* I only used 68 for my board so the 68 are more broken in. Imo they feel much nicer broken in but that's all preference.
* I have tested all the switches with a multimeter and they should all work.
* I will include 9 extra switch films with the Alpacas
* https://i.imgur.com/cOTrFrS.jpg

**Keycaps**

* I only used the PBT Fake Camping for 1 day because they just arrived.
* The longer keys are slightly warped but they don't affect sound unless you're pressing the keys at the very edge (again reference sound test). They look beautiful and will include the full set.
* The other keycaps I was included with the Tofu kit when I bought them. They were my daily driver and are slightly taller than the camping keycaps, which gives the alpacas a deeper thock. No caps from this set are warped and I apologize for not including a sound test with these

Update 12:54pm 12 July

In an effort to get a jump on packing things up, have sent some invoices out early.  As of right now, there is no waitlist, so don't fret if you don't receive an invoice early.

Update 6:40pm 12 July

While I appreciate the support from various people around the world, it really screws up my system when international orders come in.  So, to my friends in Germany, Australia, Canada and the Philippines....would appreciate it if you actually read the post.

Update 7pm 12 July

Order book closed.  Vast majority of packages already packed and shipped.  Short waitlist of 4 people, so if you haven't received an invoice that is why.

Update 1:15pm EST 13 July

All invoices paid before 10am today have shipped.  Stragglers will go out tomorrow.

Update 11:30pm EST 13 July

All orders have shipped.  All unpaid invoices cancelled.  

Just a heads up....due to new r/mm rules, this classifies as a bulk sale and thus is not eligible for confirmation/karma on the confirmed trade thread.  Please don't try to confirm trades, as I will not confirm them.  

Thanks for all the support.  Hope you enjoy your foams, good luck with your builds, and, as always, stay safe. ","[US-NY] [H] Laser cut case and plate foams for: Tofu65, Tada68, KBD8x, Drop Alt, Tofu60, KBD67MKII, Discipline65 [W] PayPal"

Hello and welcome to my Mechmarket post for my PC Canoe!This specific specimen has pretooled GMK Stabs, Tealios v2 lubed with 205g0 and filmed with ink tops. There are not any visible scratches on the board, it is in perfect condition. It is one of my favorite boards but I want to offload most of my collection to get some more high end stuff. Otherwise I would not be selling the board.

&#x200B;

The kits in question for the SA 2600 I have are the base kit, non-standard, iso and 660 kits.

I am bundling this together with Maxkey 2600 SA and selling it for a total of **525 USD + Shipping (prefer within EU due to Covid-19)**

Not everything is priced to sell.

Good evening mm. I still have this GMK Vaporwaves Base and Novelties. It is lightly used. I had gotten a lot of inquiries about splitting, and I am not looking to split at this time.

&#x200B;

I am looking to get $320 for it, shipped, to the CONUS. I am willing to be somewhat flexible on my price tag.

I am mainly looking for paypal, however I would consider trades for a soldering setup or a 65-75% chassis w/ hotswap option. I would be willing to tilt the trade in the favor of the buyer if the trade is something I am interested.

Please let me know if you have any questions!

I have both of these, they are fully functioning.

The Cherry board has some scuffing on the edges but the keycaps are in great condition and everything is in perfectly working order including the trackpad.

The Ducky Board comes with everything it originally with in its box. It is the Year of the Dog edition and will come with that spacebar as well as Pinkish/Reddish modifiers. They keycaps have minimal if any wear on them.. I swapped them out early to other caps and just put the original caps back on recently.

The spacebars are from OriginativeCo, and has spacebars to fit pretty much anything, including offset stuff. These were never used, although I do not have original packaging. Sizes are 6u, 6.25u and 7u.

Alright, this my last and final effort to trade my GMK 8008 Bundle for a similar bundle of another set.  This time I'm including a very awesome board to try to get this deal done!  Why do I so desperately want to trade GMK 8008?

I got in on the Rama U80a preorder over a year ago as a nice board for my wife.  Overtime I decided I would go all out and get her a complete keycap set with Deskmat and artisan.  GMK 8008 seemed like a good fit so I jumped in with both feet.  In the time since I've discovered that she actually doesn't like neon pink all that much and I have not liked the look of GMK 8008 on ewhite/milk boards, so I no longer think it's the right set for her.  I've also fallen in love with KAT and I think she'd love the look and feed of Milkshake.

And now the U80as have started to ship, so I'm running out of time to make this happen.  If it doesn't that's fine, she'll learn to love neon pink again!! But if possible I'd like to trade into a set I feel she'd like better. 

So here's what I have for trade:

* Sealed GMK 8008 Base
* Sealed GMK 8008 Accents
* Sealed GMK 8008 Deskmat
* Sealed GMK 8008 Rama Pink Swirl Cap
* Sealed GMK 8008 Rama Bluegrey Swirl Cap
* Sealed GMK 8008 Rama Opaque Pink Swirl Replacement Cap
* Fully assembled, VIA Compatible Gothic70:
   * Full White POM Case and Plate
   * Zilents V2 (78g)
   * GMK Screw-In Stabs, clipped, lobbed, and band-aid modded
   * RGB Underglow (23 RGB LEDs)
   * NO CAPS OR CABLE INCLUDED
   * I love this board but I love my wife more and if this will help get her Milkshake I'll happily let it go!

In trade, I'm looking for a similar bundle in sealed or like new or lightly used condition of the following:

* KAT Milkshake (Alphas, Mods, Specialties, Fruits, Calc, Deskmat, Rama Cap)
* GMK Olivia (Base, Extras, Deskmat, Rama X and O Caps)
* *Maybe* GMK Bento (Base, Space, Rama Salmon Cap), but with R2 coming it would have to be a great offer
* Other similar lighter colored bundle sets that will look good with a Milk Rama U80a and have enough coverage for the U80a (1.5 bottom row), a separate 24 key numpad, a Deskmat, and at least one artisan

Let me know what you got and I hope this is finally enough to pull a bundle out of someone's hands).  This is your chance to get a very nice set and a very nice board for one very nice set - take advantage of me!! 

**Please comment before sending PM and please no reddit chats - I can't and won't respond.**

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Brand new kbd67v2 mkii smoky/ink black polycarbonate kit. Has a hotswap PCB. Includes a POM plate that I had made as well. Plate doesn't have cut off for standoffs and is made using the files for the solderable PCB. That said you can use it for the hotswap variant as well but it's easier to do with setting up the plate/switches/keycap assembly completely and then mounting it on the board. 
Asking 375 GBP shipped - SOLD

Have some extra POM plates. 
Asking 30 GBP shipped

Dark Serika Deskmat 
Asking 70 GBP shipped. Deskmats are reasonably pricey to ship unfortunately. 

90x FFF switches - recoloured version of Alpaca/mauve. Same as any other durock linear not a tangerine. 
85 GBP shipped. - SOLD

Finally.. ordered way too much of an acoustic sound dampening material. It's 2mm thick, should fit a few cases. It's graded to isolate 26dB with a single layer. It's quite dense and will legitimately add weight to your build as it's reasonably heavy for its size. 
Let me know if there's interest and what size you want for pricing. A rough 60 percent cut out for about 25 GBP shipped.

For sale today I have:

~~[Black Barebones DROP CTRL](https://drop.com/buy/drop-ctrl-barebones-mechanical-keyboard) - **$120 shipped** - I purchased a grey drop ctrl last January and have been using it as my primary keyboard. During the time that I had it, I had the product powder coated black, and during that process some of the magnets fell off, as well as me personally kinda damaging it trying to glue back the rubber feet. The keyboard feet that elevate the keyboard or whatever it's called lol will not work, but if you just have the keyboard on your desk I think the finish looks great. Also Drop sells the keyboard in black now which is kinda annoying but I priced accordingly.~~

I purchased a Black CTRL High-profile with Halo Trues that it is arriving tomorrow (that I will be listing tomorrow unless someone expresses interest in it), so if you are interested in that you can PM and I can send you a timestamp once I receive it. For this I would be asking for what I paid for it which is $260 shipped.

~~**GMK Valentine** - **$100 shipped** - This keycap set I purchased from someone else in October 2019 and I have been using it since. From what I see I don't think there is any or much shine. Will be shipping in the shown bag.~~ pending

~~**S-Craft Charmander** - **$65 shipped** - I purchased this for my own use and used it for a couple months, and it no longer really matches my upcoming board so I want to get rid of it.

Selling a few boards I got as part of a huge bundle, and a gmk set I've been hanging on to too long. If you want any other pictures just ask.

1: Pingmaster with Hasu USB converter, everything works perfectly, just flashed with stock layout and tested. There are a few marks on the board, visible in the pictures, but it is otherwise pretty damn clean looking. Switches feel very clean and buttery. Looking for $120 local cash for now. I just don't have a box that's quite the right size for it, but I might ship it if there's no local interest. PM me if you want to try to figure shipping out

~~2: GMK Eclipse, used for a few weeks for a few hours a day as my first trial GMK set, but have since moved on. $150 shipped in a bag. If local I might be able to bum a tray off a friend.~~SOLD FOR ASKING

~~3: Golbat with what I believe are V1 zealios. I’m not 100% on the weight but they’re somewhat heavier feeling than my 67g v2s. Spacebars are linear mod switches, and stabilizers are cherry pcb pop in. Board itself is in great shape, I can't find any major blemishes. $70 shipped~~SOLD FOR $60

4: Kona Classic with MX Blacks. Spacebar is cherry linear grey, and stabilizers are again cherry pcb pop in. Only faults with this board are the lack of rubber feet and the back piece of acrylic is pretty scratched up. $80 shipped","[US-MA] [H] Pingmaster with USB Converter, GMK Eclipse, Golbat with Zealios, Kona Classic with MX Blacks [W] Paypal / Local cash"

Honestly, I had zero intention to sell either of these boards (that's what everyone says) and I really don't want to, *but* these prices are absolutely insane. After seeing thread after thread get posted and boards being sold in less than 24 hours with no hesitation, I feel like a bit of an idiot if I *don't* sell them.

In a way, I'm actually asking you *not* to buy these from me but if you agree to these prices, I can't say no.

That said, the prices are non-negotiable, however, I will eat the fees and shipping costs unlike some others posted recently. Shipping will be US based only. These will not be FCFS if for some reason I get more than one offer.

Oh, please do buy the other stuff though.

\-edit- you guys are savages. The kits will not be split up. Extras stay with their respective boards. This is an all or nothing type of deal.

\-edit2- I don't even know what to say. I'm actually sad to be dismantling the Bauer for the new owner. The Iron finish is one of the best I have ever seen. c'est la vie.

Hello there mm! I am looking to sell my used GMK Vaporwave Base and Novelties! I had them on a board for about a month, and decided that they weren't for me, just a little gaudy. They were lightly used, and that is about it.

I am not entirely sure how to price them, so I would say I would like to say $325 shipped, would like to stay in the CONUS if possible.

I would also consider a trade, I am looking for another board chassis to work with. preferably something that is like a 65% or bigger board. Doesn't need to have any switches or caps, just looking for the board. Preferably hotswappable.

Please let me know if you have any questions! I am totally open to negotiation on price for this too.

Keyboard is flawless (see timestamp for details). Will include original switch puller and wrench (be aware Rama only sent me three small screws, so daughter board is fixed with only three screws).

This board has served me well.  Great colorway (i've used it with gmk metropolis and it looks stunning).  Pretty much in pristine shape.  Only imperfection is a scratch near the spacebar stab on the plate.  Once a keyset is mounted it's invisible.   Included is MK Ultra plate and PCB foam (already in the board).   Comes with original box, cable and keycap pullers.  Cherry plate mounted stabilizers included (already installed).  No switches or keycaps.

| TKC1800 | - $170  SOLD  [album](https://imgur.com/a/sxEdJHX)

This was my first build. After completely installing a set of Burnt Box oranges, I found out about the variance in the stem sizes and how they were way too THICC. Measuring with a micrometer confirmed as much. My first soldering job then became my first desoldering job AND second soldering job. Somewhere in the process I really messed up. There were a few pads that lifted and required bridges to get everything working. So while it is quite a mess on the underside of the PCB, every key works and the board functions perfectly. In my shame I never even bothered to clean up the loose rosin that splattered, just closed up the case once it was confirmed to work and I never looked back.

* From the Round 1 GB
* BMW Tanzanite Blue case, purple plate
* Built with 78g Zealios, unlubed and unloved
* GMK screw-in stabs, clipped and band-aid modded
* There are a few scuffs on the case noted in the album, very minor and both of the left hand side

I am selling my new keeb that I love because I found out that insurance will not cover my final Oncologist check up and CT scan.

Built with Gateron SMD yellow switches lubed with Tribosys 3204. The pcb is hotswappable, so you can easily replace the switches later if you want!

A few light spots/scratches  on the bottom of the case.

Selling some stuff today. I am willing to entertain offers for silent linears (mainly Inks or Alpacas), either as a trade or outright purchase. **Priority goes to trades for other keysets with my voyage set as of now**

All cables are made by me, and are Type-A to Type-C (if you want any of my cables with a Mini-B, PM me for more info, I can swap it out for a couple extra bucks). They also have a 7"" reverse coil, with 4' cable after the connector. FYI, the Lemo Clones I have are aesthetically almost the exact same thing as the real lemos. Having worked with both, only the subtle ""Lemo"" etched into the outside is the only real difference. If you want a lemo without the price tag, this is your chance. Cables have also been stress tested for full functionality.

This is a Canoe replica. 

* Custom cerakote: midnight blue on the case although it is seriously just black color. I have never seen any blue to it, but it looks great. Satin finish
* springfield gray on the weight and plate. Gray cerakote is matte finish
* Both the weight and plate are Brass! 
* USB-C hotswap pcb with GMK screen in and lubed stabilizers
* PCB supports QMK and is on configurator (wheatfield/blocked65). Has physical reset button on back of pcb. 
* All phillips head screws have been replaced with stainless hex socket-head
* Custom gray logo infill

Including an extra unused hotswap fanoe usb-c pcb as well!

If any questions let me know. This is one of my favorite boards. Anodizing was one of the main concerns with the fanoe and cerakoting basically fixed a lot of that. External Imperfections have been marked in timestamp. 

This is a hefty boi - check the pic it’s 4 pounds and 6 ounces without switches or keycaps. Usb-c pcb is also great plus QMK configurator support. 

I’ve owned a legit canoe and honestly I liked this better due to usb-C hotswap pcb and cerakoting. Very similar otherwise.

We all have to start somewhere right...

I have for sale a KBD67 mkii Hotswap PC. I bought this for $400 from mechmarket about a month ago. I also bought plate/case foam, pom plate. I put it together and only used it for about a hour or so. Just have a couple PC boards so this one has to go. The board is in mint condition. Only marks are some tiny spots that the sandblasting is shiny. There are no scratches or dings. Only some really small shiny spots. There is a picture with the shiny spots. Really small. Also will include some gmk screw in stabs that have been lubed. Included is PC case, hotswap pcb, brass plate, brass weight, all hardware that came with it new, pom plate, plate and case foam, gmk screw in stabs.

765,1593993001.0,/r/mechmarket/comments/hlwytm/usflhvarmilo_tkl_cherry_mx_silent_reds_w_epbt/,"Hello everyone! This is my first post here so, sorry if anything is weirdly formatted or if I didn't include enough information. I’m moving this month and need to get rid of some gear. None of the prices below include shipping and I’m not sure what shipping cost to be honest. However, I will share in the cost of shipping as long as the cost isn't too close to the item's price.

[TimeStamps](https://imgur.com/gallery/bjyiDu5)

1.) $130.00 - Varmilo TKL w/ EPBT Gray English. This was bought on August 30th, 2019. It was bought through their premium customization service with an all white case, blue mini usb to usb 2.0 cable, and has Cherry Silent Red switches. The keycap set that will come with it is the EPBT Gray on White English. The keycap set was bought on December 25th, 2019. The keycaps are more worn on the space bar, QWER/ASDF, and left shift key (I'm a gamer).  


\- Lowered the price of the Varmilo.

2.) ~~$20.00 - Various brown switches (180ish)~~. I have about 180 various brown switches (Most are Gateron, but there may be some Kailhs). These are just taking up room and I have no use for them. The majority of them came from me impulse buying them from the Glorious PC Gaming Race website and then never using them. The rest are from a Womier K66 I ordered last year and immediately took them out to replace them with Tealios.

Brown Switches Sold!

3.) ~~$55.00 - 5 Degree Acrylic Case with 60% Brass Plate~~. I bought this on October 19th, 2019. The only thing I don’t have for it is the blockers for the case. The case has no problems, but I don’t have a PCB board with underglow anymore. I’m also including extra screw-in stabs (Not sure if Cherry or GMK) that I won’t get any use out of. The acrylic board was used for about 4 months before my Instant60 died (my fault). The brass plate also has some scratches from me changing out switches (you can guess how the Instant60 died).

Acrylic and Brass Plate Sold!

Just write any questions below and I’ll try to get to them as soon as I have time.",[US-FL][H]Varmilo TKL (Cherry MX Silent Reds) w/ EPBT Gray English| 5 Degree Acrylic Case w/ 60% Brass Plate| Various Brown Switches (180ish) [W] Paypal

Most keys that I used (at least 60) worked totally fine but there may be a few more with issues, so buyer beware if you are trying to fill up a bigger board.

~~Discipline 65 PCB with Creams lubed with 205 and modded GMK screw-in stabs on a POM plate. The board has a nice clack. Acrylic case is 4 black layers, 1 black pom plate, and 2 clear layers. POM plate is  thinner than the acrylic layers so the stacking isn't completely flush as you can see in the pictures. However this doesn't affect the typing and even adds some flex. Comes as built kit (case, pcb, switches, stabs - forgot to mention: DOES NOT COME WITH BOTTOM DISCIPLINE PLATE. so you CANNOT turn this into a caseless discipline).

Note: Keycaps are shown in original box in photos but will be packaged in bags instead to reduce shipping costs. That said, I'm happy to ship with original box however with $15 added on to agreed-upon price.

[**Realforce 91 JIS**](https://imgur.com/KwBzSQI): used for the last 3 years without problem, this version features the very first Realforce logo with simple blue font in white background. Dome weighting is variable (30g/45g/55g) but are noticeably more tactile than 87u's. Keycaps are in perfect condition and I ultrasonic cleaned them yesterday. pls note that this version use a PS2 cable so you might want to look for Hasu converter if you want USB connection.

Price: 190 shipped world wide, OBO. let me know if you're in Asia for slightly cheaper shipping cost.

Regarding the aftermarket PCB, it is the DP60. It has Per key AND underglow RGB. You will need to enable settings whilst compiling if you want the per key, for now i have [enabled underglow](https://imgur.com/0DLUZy4), given it is on a [pc board](https://imgur.com/Gd05MBo).

I am porting it to VIA and have put a PR on [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/9508) and [VIA](https://github.com/the-via/keyboards/pull/179) repos. Currently, the via firmware is flashed, but you will need the JSON file for it to work. Should you want to take the kit, or you have a DP60, get in touch. The QMK repo will be merged shortly.

Any questions you have, feel free to ask. As is standard, please comment before you PM.

Stay safe!

Hi /r/mm. I'm selling off some stuff because plans changed and I don't really need that many keyboards. Up for sale are:

1. Unbuilt Lavender KBD67 mkII (soldered version) with case + plate foam from stupidfish and GMK screw-in stabilizers. I originally paid $350 shipped for the kit + $22 for the foam + $20 for the stabs. I'm selling it at $370 shipped OBO, so I'm losing a bit of money here. Kit is practically brand new. SOLD 
2. Tina-C with YD60MQ with 3 GMK screw-ins and 1 Durock 7u stab, all lubed and clipped. It is built with NK Sherbet. This is the best clicky build I've ever typed on, feel is much better than jades or navies just because of the weight of the Sherbet being just right for me (not too light or heavy, \~70g bottom out). RGB is working well as seen in the timestamp. I'm looking to get another board so I'm trying to get rid of this as soon as possible. Selling at wayyyyy below costs. $200 shipped OBO :)

Thanks for looking!","[US-MI][H] Unbuilt Lavender KBD67 mkII, Tina-C with YD60MQ [W] Paypal"

What's up everyone, I'm looking to trade my GMK Voyage base + novelties + [matching deskmat](https://imgur.com/olf4OnS) for something else. Looking for something like GMK/JTK Hyperfuse, but am willing to entertain something in the realm of GMK Dolch or other dark neutral colors (so not minimal or greyscale stuff). Set doesn't appear to have any shine, but has been mounted a couple of times. Am also willing to +/- Paypal if need be.

Am only doing trades and am only doing CONUS, so please don't ask otherwise.

Hey everyone! Hope you are all doing well and staying safe.

Today I'm selling these keycaps that I don't use anymore and have been doing nothing but sitting in a drawer for a few months. I used them for about 2-3 weeks on my 8X MKII before I got different caps so they don't have much use. It's a complete set from KPRepublic so it should cover most layouts and are actually really nice alternative to GMK Muted.

Looking for **~~$85 Shipped SOLD FOR ASKING~~**

Sorry for not listing each individually! Chasing a toddler around so just trying to get these artisans posted before he swallows one of them! If you want to know what something is just comment and PM and I'll get you that info.

Not looking for anything in particular. I've been pairing down my artisan collection to mostly Wildstory Lolas/Amas, Lucky cats, bad lucks and GSK artisans but also looking for artisans that match the following GMK sets, Taro, Vaporwave, Skeletor, Redacted, Bushido and Nautilus.

Okay, that's all I got for now. Comment before PM and no chat please. Thanks for looking!","[US-TX] [H] kbdfans switch tester & switch opener, Romly Early Access book and tester (Japanese Ver.), Steel 65% plate, Artisans [W] Paypal and artisan trades"

* For the Blooby Bear and Seal, I bought a bundle from the maker but felt bad that people missed out on them. So I told the maker that I would let go of it for the same price I bought them at. Bought them at $32 but will drop to $25. See /u/shirouu-kun as he makes these very cute  caps.

Only accepts plate mount switches, so you'll need to cut off the leg of your switches if they're PCB mounts but apart from that you can use any cherry-style switch you want. Keyboard mounts switches in a south-facing style. Comes with the original box and cable.

Items are not FCFS and I will prioritize bundles, potential trades, and buyers I have previously traded with. It's also generally helpful if messages are clear and actionable. Unless they are marked as sold, they are still available.

Shipping price is not included. CONUS shipping only because shipping internationally is not easy, especially with the pandemic.

## Keyboards

### [Sold for asking] Massdrop Planck - $150 without switches, $185 w/ NK Creams

Black hi-pro from the latest drop. This keyboard is awesome. Great way to get started with ortho, 40%, and creams!

### [Sold for asking] Vitamins Included - $135 w/ Unholy Tactile Pandas

Sweet Planck-style split. Walnut plates with a coat of tung oil for durability & color. 3D-printed translucent case that lets the RGB underglow through nicely!

### Rebound Rev 3.0 w/ Krytox 105-lubed 68g Silent Skies - $150

Killer split-then-unsplit keyboard with awesome silent-but-deadly-tactile switches! **The rotary encoder doesn't work,** but still well worth it. Let me know if you want to put it in your own case (it fits in any 60% case) and we can work out a deal.

### Gergo Heavy w/ 20g gChocs - $220

The classic, in a super heavy case, with super light switches! **A few switches on the right half send double-presses**, which may be able to be fixed by raising the debounce in the firmware. Super cool board, especially if you think you can get used to the insane 20g gChocs!

## Keycaps

### [Sold for $80] SA Laser Alphas - $90

Used for a day or so. Bagged up

### XDA Canvas Ortho set - $80

Let's call it $65 if you order it with the Rebound or Vitamins Included though!

## Artisans

### S-Craft Starters - $270

From the first GB. I only want to let these go to a loving household, and only as a bundle. These caps are sweet, and some of my first artisans. I have a dream of putting these on my RoPro with GMK Dracula, but alas. 

### [Sold for asking] PrimeCaps TRDL - $30

Cool colorway - if you know what it is, let me know so I can add it to the description!

### [Sold for asking] PrimeCaps Lurv - $50

### Other artisan pictured - $25

Hi all,

I'm selling some things I've had sitting around for a while. The soldering station has only been used a few times as well as the KBDPad. The rest are unused. Let me know if I'm off on prices, and feel free to send an offer. It's been a while since I've been involved in this community. Prices do not include shipping.

All prices include shipping to CONUS only via DHL air. The typical timeframe is sadly two weeks from warehouse to proxy and then to you. It is has been very reliable from my end since the COVID-19. Here are some [track records](https://imgur.com/a/czxgagT) as references. However, there is a huge back log due to the public holiday last week and a special exam of fake products in effect so the shipping time to US and UK is severely impacted. Not so much for Canada tho.

Sold sets will be striked-thru. I do prefer bundle so it won't be FCFS.
