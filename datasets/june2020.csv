All keycaps have never been used or opened. I will not ship any of these without insurance and/or signature confirmation to a verified PayPal address. This is not fcfs and I reserve the right to not deal with anyone that seems even remotely suspect or not enough trades.

I am open to negotiation, but very unlikely I'll budge very far as all of these prices are very near what's recently been sold for. I can also provide receipts for all purchases. I'm located in 90025 - (Los Angeles, California)

Please PM before messaging and try not to use the chat.

The Tokyo60 is a V1, and comes with the case, PCB, PBT dye sub keycaps, acrylic diffuser, mini USB cable, and lubed GMK screw ins. It does not include switches. The PCB has issues with some keys in the number row not working (I believe the Kailh Hotswap sockets are loose, but I’m not sure on the issue). This is likely a fixable problem, but is pretty significant, so be warned.

Hi! I'm looking to trade my PnC base kit for an Olive one. My set is in brand new condition, I put it on to take pictures and typed on it for the following night before putting it back into the box. I'd like an olive base in the same condition if possible.

For the time being I'm only looking to trade inside Canada. The closer the better, so not FCFS. I'll favor closer trades aswell as the condition of the set.

Thank you guys!

Hey guys. This was my daily driver for about 3 months. Minimal shine on the spacebar and really nothing I've noticed on the regular keys but there may be some. This is just the normal base kit that comes with the Hello World caps. Not really sure how to price this but asking **$180 shipped** lower 48.

Thanks for the interest guys!

SOLD FOR ASKING

Hello everyone! I am posting my E-White KBD67mkii that I recently received. Board has been built but is in like new condition. I have used the board for maybe an hour to make sure the PCB worked properly and all RGBs worked. I knew when I built it I probably wouldn’t keep long so I didn’t even stick the mouse feet on. So I am just trying to recoup most of what I put into the board. I am only looking to ship to CONUS currently (will be in original box and come with everything I received with it) and not really looking for any trades besides GMK Camping r2 or GMK Mizu. Not FCFS as I am going to see if I can get a trade first. Feel free to message me with any questions and I will get back to you as soon as I can. Use PM not chat please. Thanks for looking!

I mounted these on my board for 4-6 weeks in total. I'm VERY particular about keeping my peripherals clean and fresh-looking and these were the crown jewel (my first GMK set). I never eat at my pc and would clean these with a slightly damp microfiber cloth 1-2x per week.

Please note that this board has an issue with it's top mount screws stripping, so if you plan to remove the gasket note that the some of the screws don't stay put.

Dz60 board with box jades, setup in 64 key layout (arrow cluster bottom right). Board is functioning

Band aid modded stabilizers (is this still a thing?). Built this maybe 2-3 years back? But shelved it for a long time and now I'm just looking to clear out inventory.
I believe this is a pre-retooled box switch. I think the consensus was it is not suitable for ABS caps (pbt only?), and i have a few gmk caps that have stress marks. Buyer beware

Shipping is still a big problem in many countries, so i'll still stick to DHL Express, for our safety. Shipping will be from Singapore, so expect keycaps to be \~$30 in bags to CONUS/EU, much cheaper if you're within Asia.

About the keyboard:

· Built with Gateron Inks spring swapped to 55g Catweewee springs lubed with 205g0

· Polycarbonate plate, comes with an additional brass plate from the original group buy

· Uses GMK Clip ins for all the stabs.

· Built with original TGR pcb

Issues and small defects:

· The polycarbonate is a bit too flexy and pcb will bottom out on the case.

· Do not have all the original screws. I never have used this with the pcb screwed into the case. I have some of the original screws but not all 6. I have other screws that work fine which I can include. If you plan on using this with the polycarbonate plate, I would not encourage screwing it down as it causes it to bottom out much more frequently.

· Internal defects: [Album](https://imgur.com/cJGqpfo)

o Marks from ano hooks

o Marks from pcb bottoming out on case

· External defects: [Album](https://imgur.com/VPaPD2r)

o Small nick on one of the corners which is visible

o On the front part of the case there are some very small blemishes. I have done my best to capture these, but they are difficult to see. Unless you are looking for these and searching under some really good lights, they will be difficult to find.

o The weight has some machining marks on the horn. Additionally, there is a small dot on the top of the unicorn’s head. There is another small blemish by the nose of the unicorn.","[US-CO] [H] GMK 9009 R3, Unikorn [W] Paypal"

Selling off some stuff that I really like, but the reality is that I have too many keebs and need to let some go to people that will give them use.

&#x200B;

**1. KBD Fans Tofu 65% (unbuilt)**

* Acrylic case frosted
* KBD67 rev2 pcb (tested, never soldered)
* brass plate
* MK Ultra foam
* $275 + shipping  (SOLD) 

I just received this board as part of a larger order, and decided not to build it. But I did test the PCB and the RGB, which looks great (see photos).

&#x200B;

**2. KBD75 v1 w/ tangerine switches**

* Tangerine switches, 67g, lubed with 205
* Durock stabilizers lubed with 205
* Brass plate
* MK Ultra foam between plate & PCB
* $375 + shipping (SOLD)

This board sounds and types amazing. I took my time soldering to make sure every switch was fully seated. Typing with GMK sounds like raindrops.Only selling because I built another KBD75v1 w/ mill-max sockets.

This board has a split spacebar config, but I can modify it to a standard 6.25u bar for no cost.

I also recommend matching it with the next item...

&#x200B;

**3. GMK Deep Space w/ spacebar kit**

* includes special spacebar kit
* used for about a week no shine
* $300 + shipping (SOLD)

Deep Space is a great set with a lot of custom novelties for the function row. It looks great on a 75% board.  It's quite a rare set these days.

This set also comes with the purple spacebar kit from Violet on Cream, which is exactly the same color purple.  What a lucky find that these matched up perfectly. The originative set didn't have a split spacebar option.

&#x200B;

**4. KAM Starry Night**

* Still sealed
* includes most of the novelties
* $200 + shipping (SOLD)

# Please Read
Priority to local (75002) and bundles. Bundles will net you a discount on shipping. All prices include shipping to CONUS only; I won't be shipping internationally. Everything is priced so I either break even or lose some due to PayPal fees. I unfortunately bought most of these aftermarket the same as you guys, so I'm not looking to make anything off selling these. Just looking to get back what I paid. 

Also, I work full-time so I may take a day or two to ship everything out. Please be patient with me! <3

~~E-white KBD67 MKII (hotswap)~~| ~~Bought off of someone on r/mm about a month ago, but it's just been a glorified switch tester for me so I'm hoping someone else can give it some more love. I've already put it together and put some shelf-liner in the bottom of the case, but if you really want I can take it apart for you if you want to build it yourself. Board is flawless and has only been typed on for maybe 1 hr max. Comes with lubed (205g0) + clipped GMK stabilizers.

68x Tealios (lubed + filmed)| The very first switches I ever got and lubed. They have been lubed with 205g0 and filmed with clear Kebo films, but because they're the first switches I ever tried lubing, the lube job is a little on the heavier side. Some of the top housings are also a little bent from constant pulling out of hotswap boards. I've priced these lower accordingly.  | $85, Trades
119x Gateron Blacks (stock)| Bought a few months ago from Drop, no longer have a use for these. They're completely stock. | $35, Trades

~~**MT3 Serika:** Used for a couple days, but realized that tall caps are still not for me. The spacebars (6.25u and 7u) were both warped so I dunked them in some boiling water and bent them back. The 6.25u works perfectly with cherry and durock stabilizers. The spacebars in extra mods work just fine as well. Not sure if the 7u is fine, since I don't have any boards that support it. Will be shipped in original boxes. **Looking for $240 shipped**~~ **SOLD**

**90x U4 Switches:** U4 stems in outemu sky housings. Lubed by hbheroinbob himself, for both the slide rails and the spring bottoms for silence. I managed to break in ~50 switches, as the other 40 feel a bit scratchy without breaking them in. This only took me a few days of casual usage, so a day or 2 of heavy usage should do the trick. I've separated the broken in ones from the unused ones (broken-in ones are in the normal sandwich bag). **Looking for $80 shipped**

Also on the lookout for GMK WoB, from the Drop from a year or two ago. I don't mind shine, but I will take it into account. Also would like the tray, though I can do without it to save on shipping. **Looking to spend $110-$130**","[US-CA] [H] MT3 Serika (Katakana Alphas, Mods, Extra Mods, Arrows), 90x U4 Switches [W] Paypal, GMK WoB R1"

The PCB has only been soldered once when it was being built and has never been desoldered. Additionally, I will be providing all the original packaging that came with this board.

A second attempt to get rid of everything i have left. :) As always,if the timestamp isn't enough,feel free to pm and ask for more pictures!

Most of these are sealed because they were planned for a build, but were never even opened. I added links if you wanna see how the keycaps/artisans look like.

Prices are with paypal fees but without shipping costs estimated.
For artisans,it's about 10$ to ship it anywhere in the world (depending on your location). 
For the keycap set, you have to let me know your location first so i can estimate the amount of the shipping costs.

I'm going to do this FCFS. I decided I actually won't ever mount GMK Vaporwave on anything even though it's *really pretty.* And I bought the Red Samurai kit on a whim off of Drop.

As for prices - I'm pretty sure this is around cost for each (I went ham on the Vaporwave GB; artisan, hiragana, spacebars).

Shipping is INCLUDED. I prefer CONUS, but if you are international I will do my very best to get this to you in a timely fashion. (I know that due to recent developments in the pandemic, I have two shipments waiting in Shenzhen for a month now - DHL is being cautious I guess.)

The keycaps and keyboard are just as mint as the day I bought them. I'm the guy that hates when my fingers feel oily and am constantly washing them so that probably helped in keeping these in such great condition. The keycap set looks the same as the day I opened them up.

All of the accessories and original packaging come with the keyboard, I'm running 62g v2 Zilents on this build but I'm open to plucking them out and selling it bare bones to help get the price down a bit if you want.

The zealios were desoldered from a full-size board and aren't in the best shape, that said there are probably enough in there without damage to outfit a 60-75% board.

I'd like to get all of this stuff out of my room as a bundle for $550 Shipped and Insured. If you're interested in the bundle feel free to make an offer if you think the price is a bit off. I'm open to selling separately as long as everything sells.

Update 8:39pm 27 June

Quick update for everyone, in particular our Canada based fans.  In an effort to provide access to foams to people who aren’t r/mm lurkers and our friends up in Canada, I’m pleased to announce a pilot program with Bolsa Keyboard Supply to stock certain sets of my keyboard foams, starting with the KBD67mkii hotswap. These foams are in stock NOW. The initial agreed pilot program will last for four weeks. While I believe today that Bolsa shares my values with regards to customer engagement and quick shipping and has the infrastructure in place to handle orders promptly, I’m running this program to make sure that this is also true in practice. If things go well, I look forward to expanding the different foam designs they stock. Hope you all are well and safe.

Hey everyone!

Today I have some things for sale/trade. Please note that the items listed below without prices aren't currently for sale at the moment.

**E6.5 PC:**This board is built with lubed gateron black inks, a pvd brass plate, and the yellow pcb. It comes with a pvd brass blank nameplate and a pvd brass back weight and logo. It will also come with a new black solder pcb, a fresh pc plate, and an extra gasket band. Please note that this board has an issue with it's top mount screws stripping, so if you plan to remove the gasket note that the some of the screws don't stay put. In addition, the durock stabs make the gasket a very tight fit, I was able to screw the case to together but it was tight, so keep that in mind as well. Board works great, and is a joy to type on, just looking to try out other high end alu boards. **Keycaps and cable are not included**

**Looking to trade for other 65% - TKL boards. Would love to trade this plus cash or other items on my end for Satisfaction75, but offers are welcomed! This board is not for sale right now**

**SA Bliss:**Had this set from the extras drop, fell in love with it and loved it alot, but the profile is just something i couldn't get used to. Minor shine on the caps but thats what you get with SA, otherwise feels great and sounds even better

Good Afternoon everyone!

Just a few odds and ends things that I'm looking to send along to happy new owners.

If you are not located in the CONUS, please let me know when PM'ing me.

&#x200B;

~~GMK Modern Dolch base and Spacebars - Barely touched. Excellent condition. Spacebars are still sealed. $350. Not looking to split at this time.~~

~~CRP Peacock - Excellent condition. No warping. $160.~~

~~EPBT GOK x BOW - Brand new. Never used. Opened to take timestamp. No longer have the board I was planning on using this with. $150.~~

~~200x U4 Silent tactile stems - brand new. Never used. Very cool material and feel but I have no need for them. I paid $130 for them. $95.~~

~~60x Silent cherry blacks lubed with 205g0 and spring swapped to 62g. $40.~~

&#x200B;

Priorities will go to bundles or people that I've worked with before but with that said I do try and be fair to new people on the scene because I know its hard to get started.

&#x200B;

I'm potentially interested in purchasing/trading for gmk oblivion.

&#x200B;

Have a great day everyone!","[US-NY][H]GMK Modern Dolch base and spacebars, CRP Peacock, EPBT GOK x BOW, U4 silent tactile stems, Lubed and spring swapped Silent Blacks [W]PayPal, GMK Oblivion"

Timestamp -> [https://imgur.com/a/qOfKs4G](https://imgur.com/a/qOfKs4G)

Selling some stuff I am not using anymore.

1\] GMK Oblivion Hagoramo Base set (From round 1) -> $210 shipped CONUS (in bags) -- SOLD

\- No shine, minimal / no use. Just propped on a board all this while.

\- All keys shown here:  [https://drop.com/talk/1646/gmk-oblivion-now-live-at-keyclack](https://drop.com/talk/1646/gmk-oblivion-now-live-at-keyclack)

Look at GMK Oblivion with white alphas kit.

2\] SA Leviathan -> $210 shipped CONUS (in bags) -- SOLD for $190

\- Base, Alts, Novelties, Spacebars (VAT- Green), Numpad

\- No shine, minimal/ no use. Bought the whole thing during GB for $190, so just breaking even.

3\] Noxary 280 Silver WKL B stock (Not really, please read below) -> $600 shipped CONUS

\- Built with lubed lilacs on a 5MM PC plate.

\- USB C PCB with QMK/VIA support.

\- This was listed as B stock by Noxary only because of a stuck screw on the top side of the board (middle). The screw's head has been chopped off and so, it's tail is stuck in the top.

\- The above mentioned screw does not affect the look or functionality of the keyboard as you can check in the pictures. I took pictures from every angle just to emphasize this. You cannot use that screw hole but it doesn't affect the normal functionality / look of the keyboard in any way. You can open / close the case without that screw interfering.

\- Flawless ano on both the top and bottom of the board, fat brass weight. This board weighs a ton. The thick 5MM PC plate provides plenty of thock.

\- Price breakdown (can provide receipt if requested) - Case - $350, PCB - $40, 5MM PC plate - $90, shipping - $74, total -> $554. So just breaking even with this one as well.

\- Board will be desoldered with a Hakko desoldering gun if requested.

I've got a used Tofu65 kit that i'm looking to get rid of and free up some cash. I'm not the first owner but it's in ok condition.

[https://imgur.com/a/INF4R0Q](https://imgur.com/a/INF4R0Q) \- Tofu65 album

The case has some minor scuffs on the inside of the top edge from a previous owner removing switches, as well as the bottom corners having minor scratches. None are visible while in use but they're there. The brass weight has a few blemishes on the left side and under the logo, should be visible in the album. The plate is scratched pretty good around where the switches sit. Also the PCB is brand new + tested, I installed stabilizers and realized the pcb supports north facing switches (causes a ticking sound when paired with cherry style keycaps/GMK) Asking $150 + shipping to CONUS.

|Item|Description|Price (PP fees + shipping are on me)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|KBD67 MKII|Grey, Hotswap PCB, GMK stabilizers, Zealios v1 65g r11|$400 - SOLD|

Originally purchased on last year's Black Friday and arrived in early March. It is in new condition (small exception), used for less than a week, and gathering dust ever since my attention was stolen by my now-favorite keyboard. I built it with GMK stabilizers and Zealios v1 65g r11. Both stabs and switches were unlubed because I've never heard or used an unlubed custom kb in person. (The small exception to the condition: there are some small scratches around some of the switches on the brass plate and a very minor blemish to the ano on the bottom left. These are marked with blue arrows in the timestamp album.) Two extra zealios v1 65g switches are included, and the extra screws and USB-C cable that came with the kbd67.

I'm looking to sell all pieces together now, but if this doesn't go after some time, then I can part things out.

* [~~GMK Oblivion v1 Base Kit with Hagoromo Alphas + Extras~~](https://imgur.com/a/zUWldfT) ~~- $250 + shipping.~~ sold for asking!
   * This isn't just GMK Oblivion v1 base, as confusing as it is. It is the base kit with hagoromo alphas, some Git mods (fixed) from Oblivion v2, the Hello World cap (fixed), and the tray + box from Oblivion v2. Hopefully this and the album helps explain. Used lightly for a month, some alphas beginning to shine.
* [~~Rama WoB XO Keycaps Set~~](https://imgur.com/a/HRKpkne) ~~- $50 + shipping.~~ sold for asking!
   * I honestly have no idea how to price these caps, so I'll tentatively put them at this price for now. This little set includes 5x X caps, 4x O caps, and 1x enter cap, all of which are DSA. Very lightly used, no shine. I think these were meant to be used with the Rama M10-A?

Miscellaneous -

   * DanKeys Animal Crossing Poplar artisans, one with the blue leaf and one with the green leaf. I bought these to use with PBT Islander, but I'd rather someone else be able to use them now than me sticking them in a drawer for the next 3 months.

   * 5x 2u and 1x 7u Durock screw-in stabilizers, brand new.

   * 4x 2u and 1x 6.25u Cherry screw-in stabilizers, unused but they have already been lubed with 205g0.
* [3mm White LED's](https://imgur.com/a/6bypi1R) \- $8 add-on to any other purchase.
   * 97x 3mm round white LED's, brand new. Bought 100x and only needed to use 3x, so 97x remain.

Please keep in mind, this is NOT FCFS, I will prioritize bundles as well as CONUS buyers. I will ship internationally, I'd just prefer to find CONUS buyers if possible just because of international shipping problems at the moment. Prices do not include the $% PayPal invoice fee.

Please comment before PM'ing. Reddit chat is fine. Discord is also fine, my username is jintae#0001, it'll probably be easier to reach me there anyways.

**MT3 Serika:** Used for a couple days, but realized that tall caps are still not for me. The spacebars (6.25u and 7u) were both warped so I dunked them in some boiling water and bent them back. The 6.25u works perfectly with cherry and durock stabilizers. The spacebars in extra mods work just fine as well. Not sure if the 7u is fine, since I don't have any boards that support it. Will be shipped in original boxes. **Looking for $250 shipped**

**90x U4 Switches:** U4 stems in outemu sky housings. Lubed by hbheroinbob himself, for both the slide rails and the spring bottoms for silence. I managed to break in ~50 switches, as the other 40 feel a bit scratchy without breaking them in. This only took me a few days of casual usage, so a day or 2 of heavy usage should do the trick. I've separated the broken in ones from the unused ones (broken-in ones are in the normal sandwich bag). **Looking for $80 shipped**

Hi everyone.

Just a couple items today that I'm selling to help fund other adventures.

Let me know if you have any questions at all.

&#x200B;

~~Rama M60-a Moon with hotswap pcb and internal dampener. Also comes with stabs already lubed and ready to go. Will ship in the original box. No dents/scratches that I can see. Very clean board. $850 obo~~

&#x200B;

~~GMK 8008 - base is still sealed, modern has been opened but unused, and spacebars are unused as well. Obviously everything is in mint condition. $400 for the bundle. Not looking to split the kits at this time.~~

&#x200B;

~~JTK Tripleshot Cyrillic WOB - Excellent condition. Used very sparingly. Comes with all the keys. Basically a full set of alphas with the red sublegends as well as regular WOB as well. $200.~~

&#x200B;

~~Fanoe - canoe clone but the build quality is actually very good. The board is supremely heavy with the brass plate and the brass bottom weight. Everything is functional with the board. Hotswap pcb so you can plug and play. $250~~

&#x200B;

~~I'm interested in GMK Skiidata if you happen to have it. Either for trade or I will purchase.~~

&#x200B;

Feel free to message me with any questions.

Most items I can ship out the same day as long as payment is made promptly.

&#x200B;

Hope you are all doing well and staying safe.

&#x200B;

Have a great day!","[US-NY][H]Rama M60-a hotswap and internal dampener, GMK 8008 sealed base/modern/spacebars, Hotswap Fanoe with brass plate and weight, JTK Tripleshot Cyrillic WOB [W] Paypal, GMK Skiidata"

All prices include shipping to CONUS only via DHL air. The typical timeframe is one week from warehouse to proxy and then to you. It is has been very reliable from my end since the COVID-19. Here are some [track records](https://imgur.com/a/czxgagT) as references.

Sold sets will be striked-thru. I do prefer bundle so it won't be FCFS. New GMK packaging needs extra foam/cusion to prevent getting beat up during transportation so I checked recent confirmed trades and added a bit on top to cover extra shipping cost caused by the dimension/measurement weight.

Item| Price | Description
---|---|----
~~JTK Tripleshot Cyrillic~~ | ~~$180 shipped~~ SOLD! | ~~Mounted on my board for 30 mins and ended up using GMK Minimal instead. Still has that brand new ABS texture on it. The 5 key has a crack in the stem, and needs some surgery. However, it works fine, but it sounds worse than the other keys, and pop off easily. It is missing a 6.25u spacebar and I purchased it this way. Otherwise kit is basically brand new as like I said it has the abs texture still on the keycaps. Also comes with the BoW alphas in case you don't like the Cyrillic.~~
~~JTK Pink on White~~| ~~$80 shipped~~ SOLD!| ~~Used on keyboard for a total of 3 hours. White and pink ended up not being my gig. Basically new, and has the Pink on white modifiers as well in addition to the base kit pink mods.~~ 
~~NIU Mini~~ | ~~$130 shipped~~ SOLD!| ~~Black with acrylic bottom. Has Cherry Aliaz switches (aliaz stem in cherry housing) spring swapped to sprit 63.5g, and lubed with 205g0 as well as TX filmed. 205g0 everywhere, but legs. So the small amount of tactility that Aliaz has is still there. One 2u Durock stab lubed with 205g0.~~ 
Klippe R3 Silver| $230 shipped| Silver with the two center posts removed, but will include the other stand offs and screws if you wish to put them back in again. ~~Also comes with a universal brass plate~~, and keeping the 3mm shelf liner in there with it.

The half plate is soldered with Creams that have been lubed with 205g0 and spring swapped to 65g TX Springs. Durock stabs lubed with 205g0 as well. The other pcb has been desoldered once with an FR301 desoldering gun. Will leave the 3mm foam liner in the bottom.The POM plate is also burger mounted with 50A durometer O-rings. Second PCB will not include the stabs.~~

Hello,

Prices include shipping to CONUS only. Will consider discounts for bulk purchases.

I am clearing out some of the inventory that I do not use.

The Red Samurai 60% Bundle and Massdrop x OLKB Planck Bundle are being sold individually as bundles only; not willing to split each one up. The Red Samurai 60% Bundle is already soldered and assembled, just needs to be put into a case.

Please note that the Planck bundle is missing 1 Gateron Brown switch, and the Tex case is missing 1 screw. The Planck board is MX hotswap so you can easily throw any MX style switches in there.

All the items listed here were either never used, or used for a week then put away.

Hey Mechmarket! Due to the financial circumstances I’m trying to Clear out of this hobby and as a result I’m selling  everything I’ve got! 

First on the list is a QXP.
The Qxp is built with Tealios v2 which are filmed and lubed with 205g0. And has Pre-Retool GMK Screw in Stabs. The Board itself is flawless. No scratches dents/etc... looking to get $500 OBO +shipping( this means “ or best offer below my price not above”)Available
 
In Depth Pictures: [QXP](https://imgur.com/gallery/IHR62Ag)

The Second one is a E6 v2 I had gotten it from another user on mechmarket about 3 months ago and I don’t know if it was falsely advertised. Or maybe it just got damaged in shipping it has a rather large dent on the bottom left side.( front of Keeb on bottom) But otherwise it’s beautiful. No other scratches or dents. Honestly not sure where to price this one at with that dent but let’s just shoot for $375 OBO+ shipping( look at above paragraph for what this actually means.)SOLD

I purchased this new in box from the original owner, and used it for 2 weeks before switching my setup again.  Caps are in like-new condition with no shine, although the tray is a bit roughed up on the corners if you care about that (one pushpin missing as well).  The white on blue extension set is bagged and complete as far as I can tell.  Also comes with a white on blue coiled cable made by a small seller here, may need some coercing to get back into shape after sitting in storage.

Hi Everyone,

&#x200B;

I'm looking to find a new home for the following:

* PLA75 gasket mount 75% keyboard with Koala switches - Koala switches lubed with Krytox GPL203g0 and spring swapped with TX Keyboards' 60g springs. GMK Screw-in stabilizers lubed with superlube. PCB is KBD75 v2 with USB-C. I messed up during assembly and ended up drilling through the upper left hole of the bottom piece, resulting in no screws being used for upper left and upper right (to even things out). Upper middle screw is in place, and there are no negative effects but I want to call that out for honesty's sake (I have another one with all screws in for comparison so I know there's no adverse effect). I used it for about a month. Also included, is a translucent top piece in case you want to change the look.
* Zap cables detachable USB cables combo - Practically brand new Zap cables made by Zap (Not DIY) which include 1x6' Black main cable with USB-A for host (PC), 1x Black USB-C, 1x Navy USB-C, 1x Purple Diamonds USB-C, 1x Black Micro-USB. Used less than a week. Sorry, I won't break this up; they must sell as a set.
* Craftkey Honeycomb wrist rest (60%) in Dynamic - Used about a month and half, comes in original packaging.
* Niz and JTK Topre-MX sliders combo - I bought these with the intent to do a MX conversion project but that fell apart after I lost interest; 100 2019 Niz sliders, and similar number of JTK sliders including 2U stabilized sliders. All are brand new and never used, and pretty much everything you'd need to convert a Topre board to MX except the space bar stabilizers IIRC. These must sell as a set.
* KBDFans DZ60RGB carbon fiber hotswap plate - Ended up giving away the board before these were delivered.

All prices include shipping:

* This isn't FCFS - I'll conduct communication with various interested parties and select a buyer in a few days. Preference will be given to buyers of multiple items.
* Shipping to CONUS only.

Hello, mechmarket. Not one or two but three of my end-game boards landed in my hands in the last 3 days... Austin / Sat 75 / No 2 R 1.

After purchasing a TX1800v2 because I wanted a full-sized keyboard, someone sold me an Austin R1 for a good price. I then found someone to sell me a Sat 75 and as well sell me a No 2. R 1 (for a friend). I really appreciate every person in this community who has guided people to me, helped me, and as well been supportive. 

In turn, I will give back to the community the boards I purchased for the price I purchased for OR BEST OFFER (best price below the cost I submit on MM) + shipping. I welcome and discount bundles.

This is not FCFS. I will favor people I've dealt with in the past, people who have reputation. 

**CONUS ONLY**

I will not entertain shipping to other countries. 
Everything requires insurance + signature. No exceptions. 

Some common questions:

* OP, please split GMK Bento bundle? I'll think about it. 

* Can I buy GMK Vaporwave and not Singa? I only have the keys located on the Singa v3. 

* Can I buy Singa without GMK Vaporwave? Sure. NP. 

* Are you selling your Koyu Milk? No.

* Has it sold? If it is struck through, yes.

* Where's my invoice? You'll have it within the next 3 hours.

**I will ship ALL products in a few days! Invoices going out soon**



*LOOKING FOR*

* Please sell me a GMK Olivia ++ light & dark set + rama key + Spacebars(don't care for novelties, but if you can't split the bundle, I'll buy it all). I know it hasn't shipped yet, but when it does, please pm me.

Ducky Shine 7 Blackout | 9/10. Cherry MX Brown switches. Everything about the keyboard is fully functional. I used the stock keycaps for a bit before switching to a different set before I moved on from this keyboard, so they are lightly used, but I sanitized them with isopropyl alcohol.

Hello,

I have a GMK Striker Core set. Checked search, looks like prices are varying. Used for about a week or so, spacebars never used, no shine. Was going to mount it on my KBD67, but used Bento instead. Has been sitting since. Selling to fund other things

One of the plastic locking nubs is broken in the middle. Everything else locks in so no issues there, just wanted to be upfront.

Local is Sacramento/El Dorado(zip: 95672) area and we can do Venmo there which is preferred

~~340 shipped OBO.~~ **SOLD** for asking. Thank you!

Cheaper shipping if you opt for a bag. Cheaper if you are local(due to not dealing with Paypal fees and shipping)

It does have the acrylic piece for RGB but I can only get the RGB to work on the numpad, I am unsure what the issue is, I don’t use RGB so it doesn’t bother me at all.}

HFO is barely used, was basically mounted for pictures. Minimal has been used but barely (if any) shine. Held it up to the window earlier to see if there's any discernible shine and I couldn't see any. But to stay on the conservative side, lets say the minimal has 'minimal' shine.

GMK Nautilus R1 sealed + spacebars kit (a little bit different to the R2 you're welcome to check out both sets and persue whichever you choose)

Asking 375 USD shipped OBO.

GMK 8008 + Deskmat. 8008 only mounted once for a sound test. The trays are still functional but has a crack on the left sides (they came like this during transit). The new gmk trays are notoriously bad. You're literally better off getting them in a bag. That said, both trays have been reinforced and should hold up fine if you would like them in their box. 
300 GBP shipped. Sold

Should clarify. Shipped prices are in the EU, sorry. It's a bit pricier to ship to North America. If you're keen, it will likely cost extra.","[EU-UK] [H] GMK 8008 + Deskpad, Sealed GMK Nautilus, MT3 Serika Geometries + Arrows [W] PayPal other GMK sets"

**Info**

Trying (one more time) to reduce the number of 60% keyboards, hopefully someone with a high-end WKL TKL is looking for a 60%. I am only looking to trade as this is a great keyboard, and am happy to keep it if a trade does not surface.

512 WKL in great condition - 1/20 units (more info [here](https://atxkb.com/512-wkl-60-kit-Oct-2019/)). Currently built with Gateron Inks (205g0, CWW 62 g springs, TX films), GMK pre-retool screw-in stabilizers (205g0), DZ60 PCB w/ VIA. There are some surface marks on the polycarbonate from general use as well as some tarnish on the brass; I would touch this up before shipping.

Hey /mm, I'm stepping back for a bit and putting up some things I've held quite dear in the hopes of trading for a few more of my [Wishlist Keyporas](https://imgur.com/zaQywaf). **Only a few artisans are for sale and nothing else is - so the GMK keysets and KC No. 1 Rev. 1 are not for sale... If you PM me to buy it, I may choose to post your PM publicly. So please don't.**

Everything is available to trade towards my wishlist. Some of the things on offer are not 1:1 for the wishlist Keyporas for obvious reasons. I'll also be holding out for my bigger priorities with some of these items, so apologies but this won't be FCFS.

**Only these artisans are available for both Trade and Sale:**

~~Assorted Switches - $40 shipped~~
* ~~60x V1 Gateron Black Inks, lubed (205g0) and TX filmed, desoldered. These switches are pretty beat up. Someone must have removed them incorrectly at some point, so the clips on the top switch housings are all snapped (see pics) - this means that they don't ""lock"" into a plate. They still work, but they will come out of a hotswap board whenever you remove the keycaps since they're only held in by the sockets. Additionally, the bottoms of some are pretty rough from whoever desoldered them. I used these in the Trinity and had no issues with them working in the hotswap sockets. Given how easily they come out when keycaps are removed, I would say these should probably just be soldered into a different board, but if you just want to try out lubed inks, they're fine for hotswap.~~
* ~~Also throwing in a few other random switches for anyone who wants to test out different types: 9x gat yellows (new), 2x desoldered v2 67g Zealios (I think I remember these having some kind of issue, but I might have just soldered them poorly), 4x v2 67g Zealios (new), 7x gat blacks (new)~~

**Kits included:** Core, 40s and Geometries

I don’t know if my asking price is fair for this set. Part of me don’t want to sell it because it is so nice but I have other things that I want to buy so I should free up some funds. The set has been used on my work UHK split board and then my gaming TKL-board for about a year in total so there is some shine on the alphas. Lots of keys have never been mounted at all. Comes with the original packaging and the tray, I can also ship it without the tray to save on the shipping cost if the buyer prefers that.

I tried to capture the shine on the keycaps, W/A/S are some of the most used keys and the F-key has 0 shine: [https://imgur.com/a/8iRc5gH](https://imgur.com/a/8iRc5gH) I'm happy to take more pictures/videos if needed, just ask :)","[US-CA] [H] GMK Serika: Core, Geometries and 40s kit [W] PayPal, Cash"

Good Afternoon /r/mechmarket 

I have a single set of keycaps I'm looking to move today.

**GMK Miami Nights**

~~I picked this set early this year and it's been on my work board since and it's still one of my favorite colorways.  This is the full set that came with the original GB.  The set is older and was used heavily even before me, and thus it has a very decent amount of shine on the alphas and 7U Spacebar.  The spacebar in particular has shine all the way on the right side because the previous owner flipped the spacebar so it's got 2 shine spots.~~  

~~Personally, I don't mind shine on the set.  It is what it is and that's what ABS does, it shines up with use.  I'm not about keeping these things locked up in a closet or not using them.  That's not my thing.  So the set, while pretty, still has a lot of shine on the alphas.  The modifiers have a lot less but it still is there.  Just being completely open about this set.~~  

~~Either way it's a rarer GMK set that looks fantastic and has some decent compatibility.  (I hope they run another round of it one day with more compat)~~  

~~Asking $225 O.B.O. Shipped CONUS with PP Fees included.~~  **SOLD FOR $205 SHIPPED**

I've used this board on and off for a few months, although it has become just a switch tester more recently. It comes assembled with a hotswap PCB, gmk stabs (lubed with dialetric grease and finish line), and custom cut case+plate foam (only compatible with hotswap).

Hi there, decided to sell my GMK 8008 set.  I have decided to minimize how many sets I have and unfortunately GMK 8008 did not make the cut for me.  I am selling the Standard and Accent (spacebars) kit.  They will be shipped in their original packaging.  Used for about 3 weeks total.  No issues, no damage.  Please inspect pictures yourself to make sure you're happy with the quality.  Caps will have been cleaned prior to shipping.

In the second picture, the left carton are the keys I specifically had mounted, the right side has the keys that were never used.  I used keycaps designated for a TKL.

**Price:** SOLD $320 shipped and fees included, if you are local and want to purchase (Ventura, LA, and Orange County), let me know. SOLD $300 locally","[US-CA] [H] GMK 8008 - Base & Spacebar Kits [W] Paypal, Local Cash"

Hey MM,

Selling a Unigo66, a **wireless ergo hotswap** board built by Sirius.

[GH Thread here](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=97565.0)

- No switches will be included but the entire unused GMK Dots Ergo kit will be. The bottom row of the board is non standard and uses 1.25u keys.

- I will also include 2 sets of batteries so it can last for a year or two depending on usage.

SOLD AS A BUNDLE. That went fast...

Selling the GMK 8008 set, I prefer my Miami Nights colorway. The base and accent sets were installed for minutes to see how they look, still unused. The rama and deskmat are brand new and unused. 

Highly prefer to sell as a bundle so it is discounted there. If I cant find a buyer for all of it I will part. 

Bundle price: $420 shipped conus 

Individual prices: if these are not in line with what is on the sub I can change. These seem to be close to the going rates. Again - prefer to sell as a bundle.

Today is a very sad day. I didn't want to see this board off originally, but last night I spent 3 hours lubing my newly bought Holy Pandas with the intention of rebuilding this Matrix 8xv2.2, only to unfortunately find out that Holy Pandas don't fit the tight plate cutout of this board. So now I'm on /r/mm looking to trade this board for an alternate grail board that would support these end-game Holy Pandas that I've wanted to make for so long. Please help make my dream come true by PMing me with grail board offers :(

Board is built with lubed inks, lubed and clipped and band-aid modded GMK screw-ins. Has one very very small ding shown in timestamps, completely unnoticeable during use or even on photos for glamour shots (you can only notice it if you zoom in close enough or run your finger over the ding).

I'm NOT looking for anything from KBDFans or stuff like Think6.5, Savage65 and Iron165 (lol). I will prioritize trades, obviously, but if you must buy it out, I'm putting this at $1600 (High price to discourage buyers). Also, I will wait 3-4 days until I sell it to the first person offering to buy the board, as I still want to look for trades.

I also have a black Duck Viper v2 with DP60 per-key RGB and RGB underglow built with Zealios v2. I'm not looking to sell this board, but if it helps me get a trade for my grail, I'm willing to do a 2:1 trade (matrix + viper for one of your grails). However if you wanna do a 2:1, I expect to trade both for something like a TGR (Jane/Alice) or Keycult.

Thanks for looking and have a nice day!

Lots of stuff up for sale today to make room for new keyboards and upcoming keyset gbs. Prices are open for negotiations and do not include shipping.

**Pink Noxary 268.2 - $700**

Built with lubed pink c3 stabs, 205g0 roselios, and 1.5mm poly plate. Technically was a b-stock case since the screw holes needed machining (which I had done) and top is slightly warped unless it's built. When the case was first built there was a problem with the switches touching the weight inside and causing multiple switches to fire at once but I have not encountered this problem recently. Couldn't get the weight replaced so I originally had tape over the inside of that tape that has since been removed with no issues. I think the typing experience is really good on this board. Weight needs to be cleaned and sealed if you don't want it to patina again. If you have questions or want pictures let me know! Does not include keycaps.

**~~Romeo with white p3dstore case - $175~~** **SOLD**

Built with lubed pink and blue c3 stabs and 205g0 lilacs. Includes white p3dstore 3d printed case, default flashing. This was a fun project but need funds. Does not include keycaps.

##### [MT3 Serika (Katakana, Modifiers, Arrows)](https://i.imgur.com/WWYowsF.jpg)

Keycaps for a 60% layout (tsangan) have been mounted and typed on for several hours before taking off. The 7u and 6.25u spacebars have some warp, but I didn't experience any significant problems when using the 7u one.

Update: [I have the replacement spacebars](https://i.imgur.com/4cGKOYY.jpg) from Drop. The [7u spacebar](https://i.imgur.com/9Nf9s21.jpg) has very minimal warping (I don't see it being a big issue) and the [6.25u spacebar](https://i.imgur.com/UVwm34X.jpg) has no warp at all from what I can tell.

Both spacebars, warp and no warp, will be included.

**Not looking to split unless every kit is covered for.**

These will be shipped in their original boxes.

Asking: ~~**$190 shipped OBO**~~ **sold for asking**

~~WTT for other keysets, can +/- PayPal if necessary.~~

~~If you are on the fence, I can also offer the [Geometries kit](https://i.imgur.com/6otysEF.jpg?1) (**NFS**, trades only). Please note that this will increase the value of the keyset.~~

This will not be FCFS. I am in Canada, so shipping within the country is definitely faster at the moment, but I'm happy to ship to the US and I'm willing to entertain the idea of international shipping (though I'd have to check shipping prices). These prices include the cheapest tracked shipping through Canada Post / USPS, but if you'd like better/faster shipping we can figure something out!

Ladies and Gents,


TX84 Antique Copper:
Since I got a TX84 milk white I need to move this tx84 antique copper. Comes unbuilt with PCB and brass plate. Apart from some minor pitting on the base this board is in great condition. Mild patina but I can tell it’s quite uniform. Lovely board to type on but can get even better if you wanna build it on a POM plate. I did so for my TX84 milk and it sounds amazing. I can give you the plate file if you need.

*EDIT* 
The mizu deskmat AND novelties are already sold. The post hasn't even been up for an hour and i've had literally 20 pms about them. I'm sorry to everyone who couldnt get it in time,but damn, i didn't expect that many pms. Sorry guys. :(

*EDIT 2.0* 
I got overwhelmed by messages and i had to reject MANY PEOPLE asking for the mizu sets. I'm sorry to everyone who was just a few minutes late to the sale. I did not expect so many people to want them,especially after less than an hour the post went up. I hope you can forgive me and someone else shows up on r/mm and actually gets you what you want. Good luck everyone!

Hello r/mechmarket.

Have some stuff left over from previous sales and since i won't use them, i've decided to let them go.

Most of these are sealed because they were planned for a build, but were never even opened. I added links if you wanna see how the keycaps/mats look like.

Prices are with paypal fees but without shipping costs estimated.
For artisans,it's about 10$ to ship it anywhere in the world (depending on your location). 
For the keycap sets, you have to let me know your location first so i can estimate the amount of the shipping costs.

\*\* The Niu Mini has been sold!\*\* The keycaps are still available. Note, they are all ortho or ergodox sets!

Hi all,I'm selling off some of my collection (I'd like to start moving towards my end game). I would prefer to sell within the EU, since I've had terrible experiences recently, with mail getting lost from outside the EU.

Prices don't include shipping, but I think shipping within the EU is around 6 to 8 euros, with tracking. I'll look it up for you, when I know where you want it sent to :)

Edit: when I originally wrote my listing, I went off the prices from my original invoice, but got the prices mixed up by looking at the wrong kit. Sorry, guys! I have adjusted the prices now.

Keycaps:

1. Round 1 SA Vilebloom ortho: Has been mounted and been used for a couple of months. Still in perfect condition. Was mounted on the Niu Mini listed below
Price: 78 Euros

2. Round 1.5 SA Vilebloom ortho: Kit is identical to that offered in round 1. These ship in plastic baggies, so these are new in bag and have never been opened or mounted. Perfect, brand new condition  
Price: 93 Euros

3. Round 1.5 SA Vilebloom ergodox: Kit is also identical to the ergodox kit offered in round 1. These ship in plastic baggies, so these are new in bag and have never been opened or mounted. Perfect, brand new condition  
Price: 98 Euros

4. GMK Red Samurai ortho: From when these were just an in-stock item on drop.com (well before round 2, that is currently running). They have been mounted and used lightly, with very minimal amounts of shine. Honestly, the only noticeable shine is on one of the space bars, and you have to really look for it. In it's original packaging. Your chance to get OG GMK packaging for Red Samurai lol  
Price: 110 Euros

-----

Keyboard: SOLD!

1. Niu mini, silver alu (maybe grey? I can't tell from kbdfans website), frosted acrylic base:40% ortho layout.Built with 78g Zilent switches and a transparent dampening mat.Full RGB underglow, which is as bright as the sun when at max brightness.Sounds incredible with the zilents and especially with the SA Vilebloom caps I had mounted on it.This guy has served me well as a mini little gaming pad. Fully programmable with QMK, I had the perfect layout for gaming.Sadly, time to let this great little board go, and onwards towards end game. No blemishes or anything that I can see.  
Price: 160 Euros SOLD

Quick info on the Zilent switches: 78g sounds like it would be really heavy, but personally, I find them perfect. I do type heavy handed but people with a lighter hand just wouldn't be bottoming out as much. This would lend itself even more to the silent aspect of these switches. They sound so good and a really nice, muted thock. I will be getting these bad boys again. The bump starts right at the top, but it's fairly long and rounded. So good.

Thanks, and stay safe!","[EU-DE] [H] SA Vilebloom ortho + ergodox sets, GMK Red Samurai ortho, NIU Mini with 78g Zilent Switches [W] Paypal"

408,1592109427.0,/r/mechmarket/comments/h8nb3q/usca_h_built_keyboards_qxp_hhkb_navy_blue_freyr/,"Hi mm,

[timestamp/album](https://imgur.com/gallery/T2Yv9AB)

Wanted to clear my shelf for some of my other boards coming in soon. Not really looking for any trades ATM as I have ""too many boards"" according to my girlfriend...

I absolutely adore both keyboards but I have no choice but to let these go.

Some details about the boards prior to the listing:

\- **QXP - HHKB layout, Navy blue, brass weight & Plate, CannonKeys AN-C PCB (desoldered once).** Purchased from another member here for $480ish + shipping. I wasn't informed of the scratch on the weight when I purchased it (which I heard many QXP's suffered from? not sure) but it's about an inch long and visible in certain lighting and didn't bother me too much. Still I want to be as clear as possible when selling here. Currently built with creamios (NK Creams stem inside Zeal housing) - **Stems were lubed with 205g0, springs were lubed with 105g0 - springs swapped to 67g TX springs, filmed with Tx clear films.**

[SOUND TEST QXP](https://youtu.be/6XPfNNbQPXc)

**I can sell it to you built as is or desolder** cleanly for you(Hakko FR301 - pcb will be tested prior to shipping)

&#x200B;

here's some background on the QXP  [https://brianlee.blog/2018/12/29/best-of-keyboards-2018/](https://brianlee.blog/2018/12/29/best-of-keyboards-2018/)

&#x200B;

**- Freyr TKL - Red Weight, red aluminum plate -** I think this was my first ever mechmarket keyboard purchase. Purchased from another user here for \~$460 a few months ago. No visible flaws - in pretty great condition.

\*\*EDIT: realized there's not much detail on this board available - there are a handful of these in circulation bc the prototypes were made but never went to GB. The Keyboard is top mounted AFAIK. Sounds and feels great for it's price :)

Currently built with NOS Vintage blacks with stock springs, lubed stems with 205g0 and springs with 105g0, tx filmed (Ran out of black films halfway through the lube job and only had white, so about half of them have white film) The NOS vintage blacks were purchased from another user here (ru\_mi) and these switches are amazing. Highly recommended.

[SOUND TEST FREYR](https://youtu.be/DDKaAZntWCw)

I'd prefer not the desolder this one but if you really request it - I can make it happen.

The stock PCB has been desoldered once.

If the item isn't crossed off, it's available. I update as soon it's sold.

Not FCFS - prioritizing bundles/local sales (92782 zip code) and people I've had the pleasure of dealing with before.

None of the keyboards come with keycaps.

Sound test can be recorded if requested. Shipping is for CONUS - prices will differ if outside CONUS.

## Updates

* **~~June 14 11:15 utc~~**~~: I responded to messages for the better part of 4 hours. I'm going to call it for the night and try to send out the first round of invoices before I got to sleep. Unfortunatly I made a mistake in my polaris listing. I forgot to mention that I have an extra PCB and raise the price accordingly. I'll update the listing and notify the buyer before I send an invoice for it. For those who are curious, I recieved 58 legitimate offers in the first 24h {23: containing polaris, 22: containing Jamon, 7 containing necro, 7 containing TMOv2, 6 containing sirius, 5 containing Nolive switches}. I had no idea Jamon was in demand.~~
* **~~June 15 14:07 utc~~**~~: I sent an invoice for a bundle including the polaris last night. The buyer has 24h to pay. Several bundles will be split differently depending on the result. I also sent invoices for individual items and small bundles that were not affected. Unfortunatly I made another mistake in my original listing. I listed GMK Jamon for 140 EUR when I should have listed it for 165 EUR. I paid 165 EUR (rounded up after shipping and fees) for Jamon from a drop re-cap. I will sell it for 165 EUR and warn the buyer about the change before I send them an invoice. The Jamon buyer has not been determined yet because the next polaris buyer in line requested Jamon too.~~
* **~~June 16 02:12 utc~~**~~: A bundle including Polaris has been sold. I've sent a second round of invoices to buyers including TMOv2, both  Sirius, GMK Jamon, and Nolive switches. Everything sold in the first 24h is packed and labelled and will be shipped tomorrow. Lead time from payment to shipment is 1-2 days as I only have time to go to the post office once per day in the late afternoon this week.~~
* **~~June 17 17:23 utc~~**~~: The last round of invoices have been paid or cancelled and the first two rounds of sales have been shipped.~~
* **~~June 18 00:52 utc~~**~~: All ongoing negotiations have been resolved. All offers that were not accepted have been notified. Sorry to everyone who didn't get what they wanted.~~

Hi,

I'm continuing my summer cleaning.

Prices below do not include shipping. When you PM me, please provide your zip code for a shipping cost estimate.

Please note that the S7 Elephant weighs about 11.5 pounds all packed up. I have no interest in covering shipping for you so don't ask.

Due to uncertainty with international shipping, I'm currently only selling to those in the United States.

Hi everyone, my first post here so let me know if anything's wrong. **Selling to Canada only for now**.

**SOLD** ~~The~~ **~~Brutal60~~** ~~is completely undamaged~~, bought it R2 in black with the Instant60 hotswap PCB (has warm white per-key backlight) and FR4 plate. I added GMK stabs clipped and lubed and gateron black inks lubed with Tryibosys 3204. I had to shave down the plate near the stabs because it's a tight fit. Comes with Tai Hao double shot PBT keycaps from Drop.

**SOLD** **~~Japanese Sushi Enjoy PBT keycaps~~** are from KBDFans, they're dye sub PBT and have been used on-and-off for 6 months. No fading or shine.

**SOLD** ~~The~~ **~~Black on White keycaps~~** are from aliexpress, they're dye sub PBT from a company called ""Happy Balls"". Weird, I know, but someone on reddit suggested them so I bought them. They're unused and all caps are seen in the photo.

**SOLD** ~~The~~ **~~Black on Gray keycaps~~** are dye-sub PBTs from kprepublic and called the ""Gentleman"" keycaps. Again, unused and all caps are seen in the photo

**SOLD** ~~Lastly is the~~ **~~internals for a KBD75v2~~**, I sold the case, but I am left with the guts. It's a combination of PCB, aluminum plate and stock gateron browns. I will caveat that this was my first board so the soldering is poor. I have attached photos for you to judge yourself.

Selling a KBDFans 67v2 mkii solderable board. Comes already built with lubed and filmed gateron yellows. Features Krytox 205g0 on housings with 105 on springs. 
Stabs are c3 lubed with 205g0 on sliders and dielectric grease on wires. 

Asking 450 USD shipped OBO

Has not really been used at all. Conducted a sound test using mt3 serika caps [here](https://youtu.be/Kg8lWQh2Rqc).

Sound test is indeed terrible audio quality, but it's the best I can manage with the kit I have. Personally, I do think it sounds quite thoccy and nice in person. These sound tests are mainly there to get a rough idea of what to expect. No discernable ping. Etc. 

I unfortunately do not have a gmk set to test it on in hand. 

MT3 serika set is unused other than to mount for pics and to conduct the sound test shown here. Numpad is still sealed. 
Includes: Katakana alphas, modifiers, geometries, arrows, and numpad

**100x Gateron Yellows - ~~$25 shipped~~ SOLD**

- Lubed wtih 205g0, but these were the first switches I'd ever lubed so it's not very consistent. Has the original springs. Never soldered.

**66x MX Zilents - ~~$70 shipped~~ SOLD**

- Bought these lubed with 205g0 from another user. Aliaz housing and Cherry silent red stems. Spring swapped to Sprit 65g. Filmed with TX films. The lube job is OK imo, may be a bit overlubed. Never soldered.

**GMK Mizu Base Kit - ~~$310 shipped~~ SOLD**

- Mounted on MX Zilents for about a month. No shine as far as I can tell. Will ship in tray.

**Switch Couture ElectroType 87 WKL Frosted - ~~$160 shipped~~ SOLD**

- Had plans to build this but I have my eyes on another board right now so I'm gonna sell this. Case only; doesn't come with a PCB. Needs an h87a PCB if you do purchase. The board isn't brown, you have to peel that layer off. Will ship in the original packaging.

**GMK Mizu Water Deskmat - ~~$25 + shipping~~ SOLD**

- From the January restock, so the shade of the dark blue is lighter. Since deskmats are very heavy, expect shipping to be anywhere from $12-18 based on where you live.

&#x200B;

I've got a built PC Canoe that I'm looking to trade for either a TMO50v2 , ANY RAMA keebs, GMK Bento or Handarbeit base kits (with trays). **I'm almost prepared to give my soul for a TMO50v2 though so please help me out!**

Not too concerned with condition, so slight imperfections are okay. 

Hotswap or soldered is fine  - **unbuilt would be the dream**. I can top up anything with Paypal (and visa versa). Switches aren't a requirement, but I would prefer to trade for a board that has linears.

**The Build:**

The PC Canoe has a full alu plate built with gateron ink blacks lubed with Krytox 205g0, durock stabs also lubed with 205g0. Switches feel and sound great - I only have access to an iPhone, so an unprofessional sound test can be organised upon request :) 

The board is soldered - it was my first solder job so be aware that everything works perfectly, but it isn't the cleanest of solder jobs :) 

The board is in pristine condition! I am also the first owner - so will be traded with original packaging. 

It will not come with keycaps or micro usb cable. Keycaps can be discussed if you like. Not looking for any PayPal offers ATM for the Canoe.

**Please note that there is also currently a GB for extra PCBs and plates for the Canoes! Check here: ""**[**Mechlovin' Kanu GB**](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/h7n2ok/gb_mechlovin_kanu_canoe_v1_compatible_pcb_plates/)**""**

&#x200B;

I also have a **Tada68** with a black plastic case, built by KBDfans with stock gateron black silents (although they aren't too quiet). I would prefer to keep the caps. Looking to trade or sell for 90 Euros without keycaps, 110 Euros with keycaps? But send me an offer please :) 

And lastly, a GTX 1050 that has been overclocked. Not exaclty sure what that means, but that's what my friend told me who built my PC originally. It has had quite a bit of use for 2 years for rendering, but works perfectly. Does not come with original packaging, and I'm also not too keen to clean it as it is a little dusty. Looking to add to trade.

EU or UK offers only please. I've had way too may issues with US shipping lately.

Prices excl shipping.

Please comment before PM - thanks!!","[EU-DE] [H] Built PC Canoe, Tada68, GTX 1050, PayPal [W] Looking for TMO50v2, any Rama Boards, GMK Bento or Handarbeit Base, PayPal"

Good Afternoon /r/mechmarket 

I have 2 keysets I'm looking to sell today.

**GMK Miami Nights**

Kitting can be found here:

https://www.originativeco.com/products/miami-nights?_pos=4&_sid=12f0f314e&_ss=r

I picked this set early this year and it's been on my work board since and it's still one of my favorite colorways.  This is the full set that came with the original GB.  The set is older and was used heavily even before me, and thus it has a very decent amount of shine on the alphas and 7U Spacebar.  The spacebar in particular has shine all the way on the right side because the previous owner flipped the spacebar so it's got 2 shine spots.  

Personally, I don't mind shine on the set.  It is what it is and that's what ABS does, it shines up with use.  I'm not about keeping these things locked up in a closet or not using them.  That's not my thing.  So the set, while pretty, still has a lot of shine on the alphas.  The modifiers have a lot less but it still is there.  Just being completely open about this set.  

Either way it's a rarer GMK set that looks fantastic and has some decent compatibility.  (I hope they run another round of it one day with more compat)  

Asking $225 Shipped CONUS with PP Fees included.

~~**SA Ice Cap**~~

~~I have the TKL with Text Kit, Alternate Text Kit, Orange (OAX) ESC Key, and 4 Arrows in Grey (GD)~~

~~I've had this set for quite a while now, and it always gets a few days of usage on different boards before I realize that I don't like uniform SA profile.~~  

~~The kit compat I have covers almost all TKL, 65%, 75%, 60% and even some 40% boards with almost perfect legend compat.  There's very little shine on these (The external flash on my DSLR is causing the reflection in the keycaps in the timestamp) and they feel soft almost since they are PBT.  However I just fell out of love with them.~~

~~I'm asking $120 Shipped CONUS with PP Fees included.  (Buying all of this brande new from PMK is $140 + Shipping FYI)~~

I just built this keyboard and realized that I'm a strong fan of linears. I'm going to keep my Creams board and sell this one off. It honestly sounds amazing and feels great but for what I do, linears fit my need more.

Here are the specs:

* KBD75 rev1 PCB + Black case
* Aluminum Plate
* Zealios v2 67g lubed with 205g0
* Authentic GMK Screw-in Stabilizers - Lubed & Clipped
* Razer Doubleshot PBT Keycaps

[Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/qrVSVRQ)

I'm looking for $580 CAD shipped. It's only been used for one day so far. Everything works flawlessly and I'll ship it with the original box & extra screws.

Thanks.

&#x200B;

Edit: was off by $100 (typo) in my original post.

&#x200B;

Here's the justification.

$159 + $30 usd shipping for the kbd75 kit

Zealios v2 67g cost me about $170 shipped.

GMK Screw in stabs $30

Caps $50 cad

&#x200B;

Total right there is $507. Plus my time and labor for lubing all of the switches (and clipping the stabs) + the shipping cost is the justification for $580. I've only had it for a day, it's not like you're buying a crazily used product or anything...

[Le Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/8jUDS8j)

I recently acquired another end game board \[FOR NOW\] and I am looking to sell off my Rama Koyu Tank Lite to fund my next board. This has been my daily driver for the last few months and it has been the dream. A wonderful typing experience. It is a two piece unit where the top is a single ALL BRASS piece. This thing really is a TANK. God forbid you actually put the additional RAMA weight in this.

*ahem.... BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSS*

Ok now that we got that out of the way, lets dive into the board.

I have acquired a Rama Sound Dampener and two spare bases in different Colours, Green & Purple. Red is currently on the board. In the board I have installed ZEAL stabilizers lubed with 205g0. The timestamp shows switches in the board, these are **NOT** included. I kept them in for showcasing a gmk set on the board.

~~I am likewise looking to sell my Base set of SA Bliss. Used it once and I just cant get behind SA. Not my jam. :(~~

I am looking to sell only, no trades at this time. CONUS ONLY BTW. At the end of the day I dont want to bother shipping to the EU or ASIA, sorry homies.

Comment before you PM. **Note that this listing is not FCFS, users with some form of trading history and/or verified PayPal will be preferred.**

**ALL ITEMS SOLD - Very pleased to see the Tank go to a good home.**

Good Afternoon /r/mechmarket 

**Before anyone asks, I got the little bins from The Container Store.  :)**

I have 2 keysets I'm looking to trade today for other keysets.  I am not looking to sell either of these at this time.  

**GMK Miami Nights**

Kitting can be found here:

https://www.originativeco.com/products/miami-nights?_pos=4&_sid=12f0f314e&_ss=r

I picked this set early this year and it's been on my work board since and it's still one of my favorite colorways.  This is the full set that came with the original GB.  The set is older and was used heavily even before me, and thus it has a very decent amount of shine on the alphas and 7U Spacebar.  The spacebar in particular has shine all the way on the right side because the previous owner flipped the spacebar so it's got 2 shine spots.  

Personally, I don't mind shine on the set.  It is what it is and that's what ABS does, it shines up with use.  I'm not about keeping these things locked up in a closet or not using them.  That's not my thing.  So the set, while pretty, still has a lot of shine on the alphas.  The modifiers have a lot less but it still is there.  Just being completely open about this set.  

Either way it's a rarer GMK set that looks fantastic and has some decent compatibility.  (I hope they run another round of it one day with more compat)  

Looking for other GMK Sets as trade, particularly GMK Space Cadet or something that can go well with a dark grey board. However I'm open to other sets, JTK, etc.... just offer and we can maybe work something out.  I can add paypal if needed.

**SA Ice Cap**

Kitting can be found here:

https://pimpmykeyboard.com/sa-ice-cap-keyset/

I have the TKL with Text Kit, Alternate Text Kit, Orange (OAX) ESC Key, and 4 Arrows in Grey (GD)

I've had this set for quite a while now, and it always gets a few days of usage on different boards before I realize that I don't like uniform SA profile.  

The kit compat I have covers almost all TKL, 65%, 75%, 60% and even some 40% boards with almost perfect legend compat.  There's no shine on these and they feel soft almost since they are PBT.  However I just fell out of love with them.

I'm looking for either Sculpted SA Keysets for trade, or I'm open to other keysets in Cherry or OEM profile.  I can add paypal if needed.



Have | Want | Available?
---|---|----
GMK Miami Nights | Other keysets or $225 | Yes
SA Ice Cap | Other keysets or $120 | Yes

Hey all,

I have 3 boards to trade/sell:

~~Gothic70~~ | ~~Built with T1s and C3 stabs. Caps not included. It's USB-C if you're curious.~~ | ~~$250 + shipping OBO~~ Sold for asking
~~Switch Couture Acrylic Alice~~ | ~~Built with Zealios 67g and the old gmk stabs. Using the ProjectKB PCB. Caps not included.~~ | ~~$250 + shipping OBO~~ Sold for asking
PLA75 | Unbuilt, I have already cut the gasket lining and put them in. Other than that, untouched. **I think I'm missing the nuts to screw it in here, I think they were missing from the shipment. | $250 + shipping OBO

**TRADES PRIORITY**

I'm **primarily** looking for board trades, PC and alu boards are sick and would love em. I also love 40's and Alice layouts. Not really looking for anything acrylic or HHKB, it's the only layout I have trouble using :(

I would definitely do a 2:1 or 3:1 trade for a cool board, offer away.

If I don't get any trade offers that I'm interested in, I'll sell any of these boards, all prices OBO","[US-CA] [H] Gothic70, Switch Couture Acrylic Alice, unbuilt PLA75 [W] Board Trades, PayPal"

Hello Mechmarket,

I need to sell my beloved Metropolis Set today, bought this on the aftermarket for what i am selling it right now, i know the price is high but i'd at least want to get close to break even. Judging by other sells on here it should still hopefully be in the ballpark. Set is unused/sealed because after buying it impulsively i never had a board it looks good on and now i'd love to have some free funds.

    GMK Metropolis Base Sealed     250€  SOLD

Shipping:

I am only shipping tracked and insured with DHL. DE: 6€   EU: 16€   US: 53€

Hit me up if you are interested and i might be able to take some of the shipping on me as i know it's crazy expensive these days.

Please comment before PM and try to not use reddit chat, i might not see it.

Still looking for a new job, selling these board to cover bills for the rest of the month. I really don't want to sell these boards but need to at this moment in time. The Brutal 60 SE and HHKB were both bought for the exact same price I'm selling them for, **I will not sell them for less**. CONUS Shipping only at this time because shipping around the world right now is too crazy and risky.

Hey, got some stuff I wanna sell/trade, PLEASE READ DETAILS BEFORE PMing. You know how it is, PM before commenting, pls PM, I don't understand how reddit chat works and I don't think the app I use most of the time even supports it. 

I listed some of this stuff before, didn't end up selling much stuff last time as it was right when shelter in place started. That's where the older pics/timestamp came from. I'm happy to provide additional pictures upon request, although I go to work during the day so I won't be able to send immediately. I'm comfortable to go to the post office again, so I'm here to unload some stuff. I've bought a lot of keyboards/keyboard stuff in the last few years and am looking to thin a bit and maybe even end 2020 with less keyboards than I started with now that I really know what I like. 

I'm local to the Bay area 95126 and 95008 are where I'm usually at, there will be some discount for local. All prices listed include shipping, except trays which I don't think it's worth shipping. Mostly FCFS, but I'd prefer to deal with people with more confirmed trades, especially on the higher value items. 

It's late and I'll probably sleep soon, so don't be upset if I don't respond until the morning.

[more pics](https://imgur.com/a/fXlD0qH)

~~I got this thing and while it's a very nice board, it's not for me. I don't need a 75 percent, or knob or screen. Seriously though, it types like a dream. I used it for 2 days and decided it wasn't for me. It's built with chisto-lubed zeal stabs and the older tangerine switches (not the new translucent ones, these have black bottom and milky top) lubed with 3204 and filmed. I ran out of switches for the 3 on the right, those are lubed gateron glow switches, which feel similar. I used a 60% MKUltra foam for that area and added a bit of foam to supplement by the three keys on the right, and a piece of foam from Michael's that I cut to fit under the PCB. JTK toxic is not included, but the case it came with and knob are. It's got the blue screen. **$1100 or trades or offer I guess** I don't particularly want to sell, but for the right price...~~SOLD

.

**Dead (Round 1 on geekhack) CA66**

I ought to take more pics of this, if you want them I can. 

~~Before I start I want to make it very clear up front: **the PCB is dead and it has stem breaker box switches!!** What a sad story. I was super hype on this board, and the hottest thing out were the box thick click switches. I got it all put together, and found I wasn't super into the acoustics (some foam in there would probably go a long way for the ping). I used it for a bit, and then found out that the switches would break the gmk stems and were too heavy for me, so it sat with the keyset that was on it for quite some time. A few months ago my girlfriend wanted to use a clicky board, and she told me it didn't work. I did some diagnosis, and it seems the PCB is just straight dead. I did some research and it looks like this was a common problem, and the people that got the round 1 were able to get free replacements, but it was too late for me and I never got a response. I've heard that there are replacements out there on like taobao or something, but I don't like the acoustics so I haven't looked into it much. I think a guy on geekhack is working on a replacement too? It is built with the brass plate, and the aluminum plate pictured is included too. It's got a lil dust but no scratches or anything. **$300**.~~SOLD

As pictured, includes black PBT DSA blanks. Has a cherry MX Blue on escape, and otherwise is Matias click. This was the first kit I ever built, and I really just don't care for the switches. Great starter board! I only took one pic, but I've listed it before, take a look through my post history for more pics.  **$79 Price reduced!!** Someday someone will take this cool lil board.

I prefer to store in freezer bags. **$4 each?** I don't think these are worth shipping, so local only. If you buy one of the keyboards or metropolis local you can just have as many as you want.~~ Pending

**Want**

I got this really beautiful set with a really nice numpad that I want to show off, and I don't have a keyboard with a numpad to put it on. I'd really like an HBCP to show off handarbeit on.

Hey everyone, looking to sell my reborn60 board alongside some lubing gear that I no longer need. Please note that everything here is in excellent condition, but the Reborn60 has one minor flaw that does not affect usage. **Please note that the keycaps and cable are not included.**

All prices are shipped CONUS and OBO (for the rebonr60 mainly). Really loved my Reborn60, alongside the instant60 pcb, but i just don't think 60% is for me.

This is from a build for a friend that went horrifically wrong. It took four months to get everything together, and when he went to exchange his spacebar and enter key for their accent colors, he popped the wire for both of them. 

After 4 months and a whole lot of money, I wanted him to come out of it with something more than a broken keyboard, so I thought I’d make a post here. 

The board itself is in pretty much flawless condition, it is built with stock creams and lubed everglide stabilizers. 

We’re open to trading the Savage65 for basically any other built 65%, granted it comes with caps (preferable Cherry profile or GMK). Tofu65, KBD67 Mk1/2, NK65 are just some examples, but we’re open to everything. We can add paypal as well depending on the trade.

HFO is barely used, was basically mounted for pictures. Minimal has been used but barely (if any) shine. Held it up to the window earlier to see if there's any discernible shine and I couldn't see any. But to stay on the conservative side, lets say the minimal has 'minimal' shine.

as title states, looking to trade these sets for other gmk sets. Not quite sure what I want so just lemme know what you have and maybe we can work something out. Also open to trading these towards a board or something. Been bored waiting on some GBs and been wanting to build something.

So today I'm going to be testing the waters with my Duck Viper v2, and TGR X Signa Unikorn.  Both keyboards are absolutely stunning.  As of right now I am looking to see what trades I can get for the boards.  I would be interested in strait trades, 2 for 1's, and almost anything else you can think of.

**\*\* Looking to sell viper outright now**

&#x200B;

* [Duck Viper v2](https://imgur.com/a/MSAzdIr) \-  3 total PCBs, 1 Un-built Duck PCB brand new, 1 Built DP 60 PCB w CF plate and Black gat inks, 1 Duck PCB w SS plate and INVR HPs. Duck PCB currently built had half the LEDs give out(not sure what the issue is, could be fixable), so the brand new PCB would be yours to build as you chose. Extra Duck Feet. [Custom brass weight](https://imgur.com/a/OVSuRbk) from original GB with Viper and Eagle etched into the brass. Condition 10/10, This board is flawless.

Wants for the Viper -  Unikorns, Key65s, RAMAs, e6.5s, other various high end boards.

\*\**I will take cash for this* \- $**1050obo**

&#x200B;

* [~~TGR x Signa Unikorn~~](https://imgur.com/a/Te1ufyw) ~~- This board was sold to me as silver, but I would call it more of a grey, board is in overall amazing condition except for one minor nick on the front of the case. Board is srill absolutely stunning.  Comes with 1 cleanly desoldered PCB and 2 brass plates. Comes with original box. I am honestly in love with this board, just seeing what else is out there right now because I am starting to have a collection of 60%s and want to diversify a little.~~

~~Wants for the Unikorn - RAMAs, E6.5s, Matrix, other various high end boards.~~

~~\*\*~~ *~~I will take cash for this~~* ~~- $~~**~~1050 SOLD~~**

~~I'm also interested in trading both of these boards for higher ends - s75s, 1.2OGs, KC's.~~

Bought this because I really wanted the set but trying to fund other purchases at the moment lol

GMK 8008 Base + Rama Swirl - Reduced to $330 OBO + Shipping (Will ship International but will probably take a while and be pretty expensive.)

\- Base opened to take a look at the keycaps

\- Rama bag opened to check the keycap as well

\- Price based on a sale 4 days ago, difference is that the box itself isn't sealed. But the keycaps are still brand new and were never even put on a keyboard.

**Custom YMD75 keyboard** - ~~$175 shipped CONUS~~ SOLD

[YMD75 Timeshtamp!](https://i.imgur.com/9Cxo1Nn.jpg)

YMD75 custom-designed Jack-O-Lantern themed deck, built with spring-swapped and lubed Cherry Silent Black stems with 62g springs (by feel, probably bottom out approx. around 64g or so -- I'd say they feel right in the middle of Reds and Gat Yellows) inside Gateron milk housings, GMK screw-in clipped stabs, orange 1.8mm LEDs, and JTK Orange-on-Black caps.  Very quiet deck with a gentle tap-tap kind of sound; perfect for the light linear-loving gamer out there.  Deck has RGB underglow which can be customized via Bootmapper client too, as well as entire deck can be programmed however you like.

For sale as a whole package, including JTK caps (and the rest of the unused set), and a USB mini-B cable. JTK caps have had some use on prior keyboards, but this deck hasn't been used much at all.

HFO is barely used, was basically mounted for pictures. Minimal has been used but barely (if any) shine. Held it up to the window earlier to see if there's any discernible shine and I couldn't see any. But to stay on the conservative side, lets say the minimal has 'minimal' shine.

~~Elephant S7 White/Black~~ | ~~$750 + shipping~~ Sold
~~Cannonkeys Instant60 PCB Tsangan Edition~~ | ~~$60 + shipping~~ Sold


Up for sale today is a brand new, only taken out of the package to make sure everything is perfect white top/black bottom Elephant S7 R2. I received this a couple a days ago. This is one of only 2 White/Black S7's from the most recent GB.

Additionally I have a Cannonkeys Instant60 PCB in Tsangan. This is a fixed layout (split backspace/split Rshift) pcb, and is meant more for HHKB builds, but is compatible with standard 60% cases, just with the 2 split sections. 100% hotswap, full RGB key backlighting/underglow, fully VIA compatible and flashed with a VIA compatible firmware. The GMK screw-in stabs are lubed and included in the purchase.

CONUS buyers will be given preference, shipping is not included in price. Please be aware that shipping the S7 will be quite expensive (think $40, I paid $105 in shipping originally). Offers asking to include shipping in the cost will be ignored, it's not a price I'm willing to absorb.

Please post first before PM'ing. Invites to chat will be ignored as well. Can provide any additional pics/answer question you may require.

They are all consistent although some may require a small adjustment for the tactile leaf. I'd rate them a 7/10 condition.

**Brass Chiwi 60 - Trades/Sale**  


This is a bit of an odd duck, I guess it is (was?) a prototype. It has a solid brass CNCed case, with a frosted Polycarbonate bottom, with a brass weight in the base. It came with a shiny (not brushed) brass plate, which is a fingerprint and scratch magnet, but then it's hidden when built. The brass plate has scratches and one gouge from machining, which refuse to go away with polishing so they are under whatever protective coating it has. Body has a small ding in the front, and one ding in the back (came that way, common with brass), and has been powdercoated a deep Navy blue.  


It's a heavy board,  at 3.2 pounds (1410g) without keycaps and switches, compared to the \~800g of an aluminum 60% case. If you are into unique cases, that no one else has, and that sound wonderful, this is it. If you want a case that is spotless and everything looks just perfect....can't help you there. 

Will come with a AN-C PCB (should be here on Monday), and Gateron Black Inks that are lubed with 3204 and filmed and Cherry screw in stabs. I can install MillMax sockets in the PCB for a standard ANSI layout for $15 more if you want hotswap capabilities, or solder in the switches, or just ship as is. Take your pick.  


610 shipped CONUS  


Trades: Looking for Standard layout (No HHKB) Mid to High End 60% boards. PM me with what you have and maybe we can work something out!!  


**KBD67 Mk2 Poly Carbonate (Solder PCB)**  


\- Mill max sockets installed in the PCB  
\- Custom switches: T1 grey nylon housing, 63.5 progressive sprit springs, red TX switch films, and UHWMPE stems. Deep thock and very very smooth  
\- Band aid modded clip in GMK stabs, lubed very well with Superlube Dielectric Grease.

There is also a foam insert that will arrive on Monday, that will be included, that fits between the PCB and the plate.

500 shipped CONUS, 400 without the switches.

Was going to wire this to a Teensy or similar to use this, but I don't have the time right now. Can provide the row and column matrix information upon request if anyone else wants to do this. It was designed to work with the Apple II and uses a very simple matrix.

I was going to dome swap this, but NIZ is completely out of dome sheets right now and I don't want to go through the pain of trying align BKEs on it (NIZ keyboards are pain to replace domes if you can't do the entire sheet). The stock domes are extremely quiet and pleasant, but I prefer ultra heavy tactility. This is $50 off what it would cost brand new and it is in amazing shape, barely used. RGB and Bluetooth.

_Since I ordered this, I [sold](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/ebgk0f/eudkh_vea_clone_blackacrylic_63_switch_tester_w/) the VE.A clone this was intended for, and have moved to using a split ergo keyboard with entirely 1U keys._

_That's unfortunate, as space bars look wonderful. The colour is exactly like a brand new high-visibility jacket. I could probably direct low-flying aircraft with them, except there are no aircraft now._

Good Afternoon /r/mechmarket 

**Before anyone asks, I got the little bins from The Container Store.  :)**

I have 2 keysets I'm looking to trade today for other keysets.  I am not looking to sell either of these at this time.  

**GMK Miami Nights**

Kitting can be found here:

https://www.originativeco.com/products/miami-nights?_pos=4&_sid=12f0f314e&_ss=r

I picked this set early this year and it's been on my work board since and it's still one of my favorite colorways.  This is the full set that came with the original GB.  The set is older and was used heavily even before me, and thus it has a very decent amount of shine on the alphas and 7U Spacebar.  The spacebar in particular has shine all the way on the right side because the previous owner flipped the spacebar so it's got 2 shine spots.  

Personally, I don't mind shine on the set.  It is what it is and that's what ABS does, it shines up with use.  I'm not about keeping these things locked up in a closet or not using them.  That's not my thing.  So the set, while pretty, still has a lot of shine on the alphas.  The modifiers have a lot less but it still is there.  Just being completely open about this set.  

Either way it's a rarer GMK set that looks fantastic and has some decent compatibility.  (I hope they run another round of it one day with more compat)  

Looking for other GMK Sets as trade, particularly GMK Space Cadet or something that can go well with a dark grey board. However I'm open to other sets, just offer and we can maybe work something out.

**SA Ice Cap**

Kitting can be found here:

https://pimpmykeyboard.com/sa-ice-cap-keyset/

I have the TKL with Text Kit, Alternate Text Kit, Orange (OAX) ESC Key, and 4 Arrows in Grey (GD)

I've had this set for quite a while now, and it always gets a few days of usage on different boards before I realize that I don't like uniform SA profile.  

The kit compat I have covers almost all TKL, 65%, 75%, 60% and even some 40% boards with almost perfect legend compat.  There's no shine on these and they feel soft almost since they are PBT.  However I just fell out of love with them.

I'm looking for either Sculpted SA Keysets for trade, or I'm open to other keysets in Cherry or OEM profile.  (Maybe DSA depending on what you have)



Have | Want | Available?
---|---|----
GMK Miami Nights | Other keysets | Yes
SA Ice Cap | Other keysets | Yes

Only looking to trade within CONUS at this time.  Each of us will trade paypal with a small amount to have for trade protection and shipping tracking/notifications.  

As always please comment before PM.

Midnight Bronze Pok3r | Cerakoted here in Texas, bought from WASD with GMK Honeywell (if you are looking for Honeywell rn I suggest looking at their site they got a few sets on there that you can get with a board). I switch swapped with Ink Housing with Invyr UHMWPE stems lubed with 205g0 and 105 on spring, replaced the stabs with gmk screw-ins, and lubed them, this board is probably one of the best feeling tray mounts you can get right now.  | $150 USD shipped CONUS

Hi,

I have these things that I am not using.

# WKL Sirius Build/Bundle - 525$ (PENDING)(SOLD) Paypal shipped CONUS/CANADA

~~This is a WKL Sirius with a PVD black polished brass weight. I have built it with a AN-C 60% PCB using NK creams, lubed with 205g0 and filmed (tx films). The stabs are durock transparent stabs lubed with dielectric grease. The build has case foam (3mm mkultra foam). I am selling it as a bundle that includes an extra factory-sealed AN-C 60% PCB (B-Stock so 7u only, only problematic if you want to use it for something else), plate foam, Black FR4 plate, a very small amount of extra screws (2x plate, 6x case) and switches (8x). The bumpons have yellowed (please see timestamp). I am not a smoker and it has not spent time in the sun, so I believe this might just be due to time. The case itself has not yellowed.~~

# (not silver) Grey Tofu Build - 200$ (AVAILABLE) Paypal shipped CONUS/CANADA

This is a Silver Tofu, built with NK Kailh BOX Thick Clicks on a ""skeleton"" carbon fiber plate. The stabs are GMK from before the famed retool, lubed with dielectric grease, and bandaid modded. The switches are post-retool so they do NOT have the stem issue. The case is filled with sorbothane. There is a slight ""banding"" to the silver anodizing that does not show on photos.

Edit 04/06/2020 AM: Redditor corrected me that what I thought was a silver tofu is actually a Grey tofu. 

# Instant60 ANSI sealed PCB - 80$ (PENDING)(SOLD) Paypal shipped CONUS/CANADA

~~Not much to say. Factory sealed Instant60 PCB. This is hotswap (all instant60 are) and ANSI layout.~~

# Notes

If you wish to purchase both the silver tofu and the instant60 pcb, I will remove 20$ from the total.

I will not lower the prices, please do not ask. Please send me a message (DM) and NOT use the reddit chat as my app does not have the chat functionality so you will have a harder time reaching me. The status of the items will be edited on this post (pending when invoice is sent/sold).

* So this was essentially my first ""custom"" build and I made a  lot of mistakes. It's built with retooled blacks lubed with 3204 with 55g Catweewee springs (I also clipped the legs on these) and gmk screw in stabs lubed with 205g0. Problems detailed below.
* Essentially the switches are not great. I think I did an ok job at lubing them (followed a guide and whatnot) but some are more scratchy than others. I did not realize that when people build nice boards with retooled blacks they probably go through and pick a really nice batch. I did not do that. That being said they're alright. An enthusiast would notice it but it still feels nice to type on
* Similar to above except with stabs. I was careless and soldered my board without double checking the stabs. I feel that I was very careful in how I clipped lubed and bandaid modded them but when I got the board together I realized the left space stab was completely sticky. I didn't want to completely desolder or cut the case to get it out so after a lot of testing and frustration I just ended up clipping the tops of that stabilizer off as seen in the album. It works fine this way. In fact I have heard of people building this layout without stabs at all, but I am certainly not proud of it.
* Right space stab is a little poor as well  but only slightly.
* All of the switches might not be perfectly flush with the plate. I have tried to fix this and think I got all of them but still putting this disclaimer just in case. I had used these switches before in a hotswap board meaning their legs were cut. The tolerances of the plate were pretty high so nothing really snapped into place and I kind of just tried to hold them in as I soldered. Meh.  I think any remaining problems of this are not noticeable to me at least.
* Led strips on the back work great should be no problems there.
* **TLDR: Board has some definite errors but overall is enjoyable to use and I am only selling because I didn't end up liking the layout. I feel the pricing is fair given that all of the above issues could be fixed by the buyer if they chose to desolder and rebuild themselves and the price itself would not be bad for an unbuilt kit. I am still losing like $50 on this (deserved).**
* I replaced the included bottom screws with some of my own that were longer but I will include the original screws as well.

* Not much to see here. Bought it used as part of a bundle here on mm and used in 1 class for 1 semester last fall and hasn't been touched since. Everything works to my knowledge. Has minimal wear (not none but certainly not a lot)
* CAUTION stabs are very rattly. I realize this is par for the course with these kinds of boards but wanted to warn anyway. LMK if you would like to hear a sound test.

HFO is barely used, was basically mounted for pictures. Minimal has been used but barely (if any) shine. Held it up to the window earlier to see if there's any discernible shine and I couldn't see any. But to stay on the conservative side, lets say the minimal has 'minimal' shine.

Purchased this about a month ago from AliExpress and it just arrived about a week ago. I put it together and used it for a couple of hours, but I have purchased other ortho's since ordering this one and honestly don't see myself using this one that much. It is like new. Silver Aluminum Case, Black Aluminum Plate. It does have RGB although it is not per key, however it does have several lighting effects. I wasn't going for lighting hence I got the black plate. Comes with USB-C cable, not a very long one but it does have a nice texture to it. Solid board, I  just don't have room for it right now. I will share with you the board's current layout as I have a reset key mapped so you do not have to use the reset button on the bottom of the PCB to flash your own layout.

# Summary

Hello! Long story short -- I made some bad investments and need the cash from this sale :( Also, I'm just gonna apologize now if you don't agree with the price, but I think the price is fair as I based it on the like-model commission price (plus I'm also including a bunch of extras). I planned to keep this board forever but unfortunately I need the money to cover my losses. Thanks ahead of time for understanding.

# Description

I'm selling a Keycult No. 2 Rev. 1 (A-stock, WKL, original owner). Won from KC raffle and used for a few weeks after I got it, then stored it in a hard-shell clam case and haven't used it since. Like brand-new, no issues. Built with:

* Switches: Gateron Black Inks (lubed with 205g0). No issues with the Inks, I purchased the first/second? batch and did not encounter any leaf issues.
* Plate: Brass Full (Leaf Spring)
* Stabs: Pre-tooled GMK screw-in (lubed with 205g0)

*\*\* Note: does not come with keycaps pictured \*\**

Also included will be all of the following extras (brand new, sealed):

* PCB 1: WT-80A PCB by Wilba (standard)
* PCB 2: WT-80BC PCB by Wilba (hotswap)
* Plate 1: Aluminum Full (Leaf Spring, Gold)
* Plate 2: Half PC
* All original packaging

HFO is barely used, was basically mounted for pictures. Minimal has been used but barely (if any) shine. Held it up to the window earlier to see if there's any discernible shine and I couldn't see any. But to stay on the conservative side, lets say the minimal has 'minimal' shine.

Have an APT Hall effect keyboard I don't have any use for anymore. Great board , the switches are very smooth (contactless switch mechanisms help) and are lightly lubed albeit light. The board is sanded and painted black. The keycap set is a doubleshot shine through set and the board supports full RGB. 

Package includes original wire , instructions and keycap puller.

It's great for gaming and has a satisfying typing experience(the switches are pretty thocky) 

Can include a braided USB c cable with a C to micro b converter (the board natively supports micro b)

Hi there,

I am selling a few things.

1. ~~**2x GMK Night Runner Base Kit:** One has been opened but never used (which is when I decided to sell them as I can not see myself using it for too long as it's a bit too 'toxic' for my tastes in real life), the other one is still sealed. **Asking 210€ each plus shipping but I am willing to negotiate.**~~ SOLD
2. ~~52x Gateron Greens: Black bottom, clear top. These were soldered in my first ever board but I desoldered them shortly after. **10€ + Shipping but am willing to negotiate.**~~ **SOLD**

I ship using DHL and each shipment will be trackable. [Please consider DHLs general notes during Coronavirus](https://www.dhl.de/en/privatkunden/kampagnenseiten/coronavirus.html) \- shipping to some countries may not be possible at all, or only with a premium. I have already had a look at some countries: Australia - currently not able to ship to Australia. USA - premium shipping only, which is 52,99€. 

If you are from a country not using Euros, please make the necessary currency conversions yourself.

Please use private messages and avoid the chat. Also, please comment before PMing, thank you!","[EU-DE] [H] 2x GMK Night Runner, 52x Gateron Greens [W]Paypal"
