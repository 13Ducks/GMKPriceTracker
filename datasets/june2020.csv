The Tokyo60 is a V1, and comes with the case, PCB, PBT dye sub keycaps, acrylic diffuser, mini USB cable, and lubed GMK screw ins. It does not include switches. The PCB has issues with some keys in the number row not working (I believe the Kailh Hotswap sockets are loose, but I’m not sure on the issue). This is likely a fixable problem, but is pretty significant, so be warned.

Hello everyone! I am posting my E-White KBD67mkii that I recently received. Board has been built but is in like new condition.

Shipping is still a big problem in many countries, so i'll still stick to DHL Express, for our safety. Shipping will be from Singapore, so expect keycaps to be \~$30 in bags to CONUS/EU, much cheaper if you're within Asia.

Selling off some stuff that I really like, but the reality is that I have too many keebs and need to let some go to people that will give them use.

&#x200B;

**1. KBD Fans Tofu 65% (unbuilt)**

* Acrylic case frosted
* KBD67 rev2 pcb (tested, never soldered)
* brass plate
* MK Ultra foam
* $275 + shipping  (SOLD) 

I just received this board as part of a larger order, and decided not to build it. But I did test the PCB and the RGB, which looks great (see photos).

&#x200B;

**2. KBD75 v1 w/ tangerine switches**

* Tangerine switches, 67g, lubed with 205
* Durock stabilizers lubed with 205
* Brass plate
* MK Ultra foam between plate & PCB
* $375 + shipping (SOLD)

This board sounds and types amazing. I took my time soldering to make sure every switch was fully seated. Typing with GMK sounds like raindrops.Only selling because I built another KBD75v1 w/ mill-max sockets.

This board has a split spacebar config, but I can modify it to a standard 6.25u bar for no cost.

I also recommend matching it with the next item...

&#x200B;

**3. GMK Deep Space w/ spacebar kit**

* includes special spacebar kit
* used for about a week no shine
* $300 + shipping (SOLD)

Deep Space is a great set with a lot of custom novelties for the function row. It looks great on a 75% board.  It's quite a rare set these days.

This set also comes with the purple spacebar kit from Violet on Cream, which is exactly the same color purple.  What a lucky find that these matched up perfectly. The originative set didn't have a split spacebar option.

&#x200B;

**4. KAM Starry Night**

* Still sealed
* includes most of the novelties
* $200 + shipping (SOLD)

&#x200B;

**5. 60% bamboo cases**

* see photos
* ~~two~~ one available (case w/ extended wrist wrest is available)
* Case foam from MK Ultra
* $50 ea. + shipping  (travel case w/ lid SOLD)

Hey all, 

Letting some old stuff go to make room for some new boards I recently picked up.

# Please Read
Priority to local (75002) and bundles. Bundles will net you a discount on shipping. All prices include shipping to CONUS only; I won't be shipping internationally. Everything is priced so I either break even or lose some due to PayPal fees. I unfortunately bought most of these aftermarket the same as you guys, so I'm not looking to make anything off selling these. Just looking to get back what I paid. 

Also, I work full-time so I may take a day or two to ship everything out. Please be patient with me! <3 

Comment before PM. Thanks!

WKL Key65 (hotswap) | Red aluminium top, mid, and bottom, with top-right key logo and key logo on the back weight. Comes with an extra PC plate (7u layout) and red aluminium plate (7u layout). The PCB is hotswap. Comes with the original dampening foam. Please note --- there is a smudge on the back weight from when I tried to wipe it with an alcohol wipe, and there are some minor blemishes near the top two corners; none of these are visible in use. See the [album](https://imgur.com/a/lab9N6h) for details. I built this a while ago with Gat Black Inks, and have since disassembled it; here's a [soundtest](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Gke_7bgkny1qj-_wTQ8hpO2TjoVOdPb/view?usp=drivesdk) if you're curious. Comes with original packaging, accessories, leftover gaskets, and a pair of torn gloves because I put them on wrong.  | $825, Trades
~~E-white KBD67 MKII (hotswap)~~| ~~Bought off of someone on r/mm about a month ago, but it's just been a glorified switch tester for me so I'm hoping someone else can give it some more love. I've already put it together and put some shelf-liner in the bottom of the case, but if you really want I can take it apart for you if you want to build it yourself. Board is flawless and has only been typed on for maybe 1 hr max. Comes with lubed (205g0) + clipped GMK stabilizers. [More pictures](https://imgur.com/a/Et5XRKf)~~ | ~~$420 (nice), Trades~~ SOLD for $390 
~~Singa PCB/plate bundle~~| ~~Bought these because I'm stupid and can't read. I don't own a Singa so these are actually useless to me. Literally anyone please take these off my hands lmao~~ | ~~$90, Trades~~ SOLD
~~110x Invyr UHMWPE Stems~~| ~~Bought a looooooong time ago, never got around to putting them in anything, and now I don't have time to. Hopefully someone else finds a use for these. Completely new, never opened.~~ | ~~$50, Trades~~ SOLD
68x Tealios (lubed + filmed)| The very first switches I ever got and lubed. They have been lubed with 205g0 and filmed with clear Kebo films, but because they're the first switches I ever tried lubing, the lube job is a little on the heavier side. Some of the top housings are also a little bent from constant pulling out of hotswap boards. I've priced these lower accordingly.  | $85, Trades
119x Gateron Blacks (stock)| Bought a few months ago from Drop, no longer have a use for these. They're completely stock. | $35, Trades

[XENO 75% Custom Keyboard Kit in Black and PVD Rose Gold](https://imgur.com/a/LYfHjns) | This is an A-Stock XENO in Onyx Black and PVD Rose Gold. I'm selling this board as a kit with switches and stabs included. This board was built with Holy Pandas lubed with 3204 on a PVD Brass Rose Gold half plate and lubed Zeal Stabs. The PCB has only been soldered once when it was being built and has never been desoldered. Additionally, I will be providing all the original packaging that came with this board. There are some minor smudges on the rear weight that can most likely be polished off. See album for more details. | ~~$900~~ **SOLD**
[Kumo Minivan Kit](https://imgur.com/a/QACFS9q) | This is an A-Stock Minivan Kumo that I purchased as part of the kickstarter for this board. This board also includes switches and stabs. This Kumo was built with stock 62g Milky Top Tangerines and lubed Zeal Stabs. All original packaging will be included with this board along with some additional items such as the carrying holster and a set of N6 GMK Keycaps that were designed specifically for the Minivan layout. This board is in perfect condition as it was used very lightly and you can check out the album for more details. | ~~$200~~ **SOLD**

Hi r/mechmarket.

A second attempt to get rid of everything i have left. :) As always,if the timestamp isn't enough,feel free to pm and ask for more pictures!

Most of these are sealed because they were planned for a build, but were never even opened. I added links if you wanna see how the keycaps/artisans look like.

Prices are with paypal fees but without shipping costs estimated.
For artisans,it's about 10$ to ship it anywhere in the world (depending on your location). 
For the keycap set, you have to let me know your location first so i can estimate the amount of the shipping costs.

To speed up the process and reduce errors, I’m taking order via google form. Please comment first, then complete the form (so I can identify if the form isn’t working). I've included more details/FAQ on the order form, so that this post doesn't end up being 5 pages long - please read there.

[Order Form](https://forms.gle/yfNaHUBxY1QuVfer6)

If you miss this round, please fill out the notification form higher up in this post, if you would like to be notified for the next round.

Timeline:

\-Form open: Now (\~3pm EST), Saturday 27 June until 7pm EST, Sunday 28 June, unless demand is obviously greater than what I can cut for

\-Invoices will go out between form close and 9pm EST, Sunday 28 June

\-Payment due by 8pm EST, Monday 29 June

\-Shipping no later than Wednesday 1 July - if you pay Sunday night, your order will likely get shipped Monday morning

If you are unwilling/unable to make this timeframe, please do not order.

Also, Canada based people, hope to have an announcement in the next 5 days or so of a way to get foams to you. I’ve done my best to keep a list of folks who have reached out, but would help me out if you could fill out the notification form: [Notification Form](https://forms.gle/m5HEEXna7yMRCWdX6)

This post will be updated with status updates, so please watch this space.  As always, thanks to everyone for the support.  Hope you all and your families are healthy and safe.

Update 8:39pm 27 June

Quick update for everyone, in particular our Canada based fans.  In an effort to provide access to foams to people who aren’t r/mm lurkers and our friends up in Canada, I’m pleased to announce a pilot program with Bolsa Keyboard Supply to stock certain sets of my keyboard foams, starting with the KBD67mkii hotswap. These foams are in stock NOW. The initial agreed pilot program will last for four weeks. While I believe today that Bolsa shares my values with regards to customer engagement and quick shipping and has the infrastructure in place to handle orders promptly, I’m running this program to make sure that this is also true in practice. If things go well, I look forward to expanding the different foam designs they stock. Hope you all are well and safe.

Update 11:52pm 27 June

Wow.  Thank you all for the support today and the feedback.  Best part about this whole project is hearing from people in the community who are happy.

Today I have some things for sale/trade. Please note that the items listed below without prices aren't currently for sale at the moment.

**E6.5 PC:**This board is built with lubed gateron black inks, a pvd brass plate, and the yellow pcb. It comes with a pvd brass blank nameplate and a pvd brass back weight and logo. It will also come with a new black solder pcb, a fresh pc plate, and an extra gasket band. Please note that this board has an issue with it's top mount screws stripping, so if you plan to remove the gasket note that the some of the screws don't stay put. In addition, the durock stabs make the gasket a very tight fit, I was able to screw the case to together but it was tight, so keep that in mind as well. Board works great, and is a joy to type on, just looking to try out other high end alu boards. **Keycaps and cable are not included**

**Looking to trade for other 65% - TKL boards. Would love to trade this plus cash or other items on my end for Satisfaction75, but offers are welcomed! This board is not for sale right now**

**SA Bliss:**Had this set from the extras drop, fell in love with it and loved it alot, but the profile is just something i couldn't get used to. Minor shine on the caps but thats what you get with SA, otherwise feels great and sounds even better

**Looking to trade for other GMK sets, not selling at the moment**

Pending Sold **~~84x Milky Gateron Yellows:~~**~~Honestly have no idea why i bought this, thought maybe i was gonna lube and film them for future build but decided against it. They are completely stock and will be shipped in a baggie that came from where I got them.~~

Looking to get back what I paid, so **$20 shipped**

Pending Claimed **~~BDN9 Macropad:~~**~~Bought this little macropad to practice soldering, but it ended up coming after my Sav65 so I just went for it (everything went well). It's soldered with 7 lubed and filmed milky gat yellows, and one lubed and filmed alpaca. Also comes with rotary encoders and 2 silver knobs.~~ **~~Please note when I plugged it in I couldn't get my computer to recognize it, maybe I was flashing wrong but giving out as is!~~**

~~Just cover shipping cost and it's yours! Someone on this subreddit did a really nice gesture for me, so i am trying to pay it forward.~~

Please comment before pm, and let me know if I am missing anything! Thank you and happy clacking."

Selling GMK 8008 Base kit. I got it from the extras sale intending it as a gift for someone whose heart is now set on MoDo 2 for their grey-with-neon-color colorway needs. What a fickle bunch of nerds we are...

Opened for QC before packing it back up, no issues. The cardboard wrap with logo got a bit dented in on the bottom during shipping, but the trays and keys are pristine and never mounted.

Didn't sell last time, so I'm marking it down a tad. Selling my precious Nyquist v3, in a KPRepublic SP50 case. Board is built with Box Jades. Comes with a full set of SP DSA PBT keycaps. Split life isn't for me, I guess.

Selling this board for **180 euros / 200 dollars**, but willing to entertain any offers. Would also be okay taking trade for GMK Oblivion Regular / Git Base, or other pretty dark-coloured keycap sets."

Timestamp -> [https://imgur.com/a/qOfKs4G](https://imgur.com/a/qOfKs4G)

Selling some stuff I am not using anymore.

1\] GMK Oblivion Hagoramo Base set (From round 1) -> $210 shipped CONUS (in bags) -- SOLD

\- No shine, minimal / no use. Just propped on a board all this while.

\- All keys shown here:  [https://drop.com/talk/1646/gmk-oblivion-now-live-at-keyclack](https://drop.com/talk/1646/gmk-oblivion-now-live-at-keyclack)

Look at GMK Oblivion with white alphas kit.

2\] SA Leviathan -> $210 shipped CONUS (in bags) -- SOLD for $190

\- Base, Alts, Novelties, Spacebars (VAT- Green), Numpad

\- No shine, minimal/ no use. Bought the whole thing during GB for $190, so just breaking even.

3\] Noxary 280 Silver WKL B stock (Not really, please read below) -> $600 shipped CONUS

\- Built with lubed lilacs on a 5MM PC plate.

\- USB C PCB with QMK/VIA support.

\- This was listed as B stock by Noxary only because of a stuck screw on the top side of the board (middle). The screw's head has been chopped off and so, it's tail is stuck in the top.

\- The above mentioned screw does not affect the look or functionality of the keyboard as you can check in the pictures. I took pictures from every angle just to emphasize this. You cannot use that screw hole but it doesn't affect the normal functionality / look of the keyboard in any way. You can open / close the case without that screw interfering.

\- Flawless ano on both the top and bottom of the board, fat brass weight. This board weighs a ton. The thick 5MM PC plate provides plenty of thock.

\- Price breakdown (can provide receipt if requested) - Case - $350, PCB - $40, 5MM PC plate - $90, shipping - $74, total -> $554. So just breaking even with this one as well.

\- Board will be desoldered with a Hakko desoldering gun if requested.

I've got a used Tofu65 kit that i'm looking to get rid of and free up some cash. I'm not the first owner but it's in ok condition.

[https://imgur.com/a/INF4R0Q](https://imgur.com/a/INF4R0Q) \- Tofu65 album

The case has some minor scuffs on the inside of the top edge from a previous owner removing switches, as well as the bottom corners having minor scratches. None are visible while in use but they're there. The brass weight has a few blemishes on the left side and under the logo, should be visible in the album. The plate is scratched pretty good around where the switches sit. Also the PCB is brand new + tested, I installed stabilizers and realized the pcb supports north facing switches (causes a ticking sound when paired with cherry style keycaps/GMK) Asking $150 + shipping to CONUS.

I also just took an L on the Hiney TKL and want to fund a Slipline instead, though I will probably also take an L on that too :(

[The Stamp of Time](https://imgur.com/a/CrdNJOg)

Keyboards -

* [~~Lubrigante build~~](https://imgur.com/a/AQrYMSa) ~~- $220 + shipping.~~ sold for asking!
   * Lubrigante case (red/blood orange clear), Project Keyboard PCB with full RGB underglow and indicators, lubed Cherry stabs, and Tangerine v1 switches which are lubed (205g0) and filmed (TX films).

Switches -

* [H1's](https://imgur.com/a/P0j2Rue) \- $40 + shipping.
   * 32x H1 switches unlubed (other than factory lube), filmed (TX films), and spring swapped (65g TX springs). These have not been used.
* [~~Gateron Pinks~~](https://imgur.com/a/spzeNqL) ~~- $70 + shipping.~~ sold for asking!
   * 66x Gateron Pink switches lubed (205g0) and spring swapped (68g Catweewee springs). Lovely milky top switch in a cute color that almost makes me want to keep them. They have been desoldered once.
* [~~Vintage Blacks~~](https://imgur.com/a/XSnLAqs) ~~- $120 + shipping.~~ sold for $115 + shipping/fees!
   * 77x vintage Cherry Black switches lubed (205g0), filmed (TX films), and spring swapped (67g punchy springs). These are not NOS vints, I don't really know anything about their origin other than them being from around the 1980's(?). They have been desoldered once.

Keycaps -

* [~~GMK Oblivion v1 Base Kit with Hagoromo Alphas + Extras~~](https://imgur.com/a/zUWldfT) ~~- $250 + shipping.~~ sold for asking!
   * This isn't just GMK Oblivion v1 base, as confusing as it is. It is the base kit with hagoromo alphas, some Git mods (fixed) from Oblivion v2, the Hello World cap (fixed), and the tray + box from Oblivion v2. Hopefully this and the album helps explain. Used lightly for a month, some alphas beginning to shine.
* [~~Rama WoB XO Keycaps Set~~](https://imgur.com/a/HRKpkne) ~~- $50 + shipping.~~ sold for asking!
   * I honestly have no idea how to price these caps, so I'll tentatively put them at this price for now. This little set includes 5x X caps, 4x O caps, and 1x enter cap, all of which are DSA. Very lightly used, no shine. I think these were meant to be used with the Rama M10-A?

Miscellaneous -

* [~~Animal Crossing Artisans~~](https://imgur.com/a/RJ2A1l2) ~~- $50 + shipping for one, or $90 + shipping for the set.~~ sold for asking!
   * DanKeys Animal Crossing Poplar artisans, one with the blue leaf and one with the green leaf. I bought these to use with PBT Islander, but I'd rather someone else be able to use them now than me sticking them in a drawer for the next 3 months.
* [~~Durock Screw-in Stabilizer Set~~](https://imgur.com/a/Vizdpbs)~~- $20 add-on to any other purchase.~~ bundled with pinks!
   * 5x 2u and 1x 7u Durock screw-in stabilizers, brand new.
* [~~Cherry Screw-In Stabilizer Set~~](https://imgur.com/a/9cnTxCD) ~~- $10 add-on to any other purchase.~~ bundled with pinks!
   * 4x 2u and 1x 6.25u Cherry screw-in stabilizers, unused but they have already been lubed with 205g0.
* [3mm White LED's](https://imgur.com/a/6bypi1R) \- $8 add-on to any other purchase.
   * 97x 3mm round white LED's, brand new. Bought 100x and only needed to use 3x, so 97x remain.

Please keep in mind, this is NOT FCFS, I will prioritize bundles as well as CONUS buyers. I will ship internationally, I'd just prefer to find CONUS buyers if possible just because of international shipping problems at the moment. Prices do not include the $% PayPal invoice fee.

Please comment before PM'ing. Reddit chat is fine. Discord is also fine, my username is jintae#0001, it'll probably be easier to reach me there anyways.

EDIT - a lot more pm's than I expected, please be patient with me, I will get to you :)"

Hi everyone.

Just a couple items today that I'm selling to help fund other adventures.

Let me know if you have any questions at all.

&#x200B;

~~Rama M60-a Moon with hotswap pcb and internal dampener. Also comes with stabs already lubed and ready to go. Will ship in the original box. No dents/scratches that I can see. Very clean board. $850 obo~~

&#x200B;

~~GMK 8008 - base is still sealed, modern has been opened but unused, and spacebars are unused as well. Obviously everything is in mint condition. $400 for the bundle. Not looking to split the kits at this time.~~

&#x200B;

~~JTK Tripleshot Cyrillic WOB - Excellent condition. Used very sparingly. Comes with all the keys. Basically a full set of alphas with the red sublegends as well as regular WOB as well. $200.~~

&#x200B;

~~Fanoe - canoe clone but the build quality is actually very good. The board is supremely heavy with the brass plate and the brass bottom weight. Everything is functional with the board. Hotswap pcb so you can plug and play. $250~~

&#x200B;

~~I'm interested in GMK Skiidata if you happen to have it. Either for trade or I will purchase.~~

&#x200B;

Feel free to message me with any questions.

Most items I can ship out the same day as long as payment is made promptly.

&#x200B;

Hope you are all doing well and staying safe.

&#x200B;

Have a great day!"

All prices include shipping to CONUS only via DHL air. The typical timeframe is one week from warehouse to proxy and then to you. It is has been very reliable from my end since the COVID-19. Here are some [track records](https://imgur.com/a/czxgagT) as references.

Sold sets will be striked-thru. I do prefer bundle so it won't be FCFS. New GMK packaging needs extra foam/cusion to prevent getting beat up during transportation so I checked recent confirmed trades and added a bit on top to cover extra shipping cost caused by the dimension/measurement weight.

Item| Price | Description
---|---|----
~~JTK Tripleshot Cyrillic~~ | ~~$180 shipped~~ SOLD! | ~~Mounted on my board for 30 mins and ended up using GMK Minimal instead. Still has that brand new ABS texture on it. The 5 key has a crack in the stem, and needs some surgery. However, it works fine, but it sounds worse than the other keys, and pop off easily. It is missing a 6.25u spacebar and I purchased it this way. Otherwise kit is basically brand new as like I said it has the abs texture still on the keycaps. Also comes with the BoW alphas in case you don't like the Cyrillic.~~
~~JTK Pink on White~~| ~~$80 shipped~~ SOLD!| ~~Used on keyboard for a total of 3 hours. White and pink ended up not being my gig. Basically new, and has the Pink on white modifiers as well in addition to the base kit pink mods.~~ 
~~NIU Mini~~ | ~~$130 shipped~~ SOLD!| ~~Black with acrylic bottom. Has Cherry Aliaz switches (aliaz stem in cherry housing) spring swapped to sprit 63.5g, and lubed with 205g0 as well as TX filmed. 205g0 everywhere, but legs. So the small amount of tactility that Aliaz has is still there. One 2u Durock stab lubed with 205g0.~~ 
Klippe R3 Silver| $230 shipped| Silver with the two center posts removed, but will include the other stand offs and screws if you wish to put them back in again. ~~Also comes with a universal brass plate~~, and keeping the 3mm shelf liner in there with it.

The half plate is soldered with Creams that have been lubed with 205g0 and spring swapped to 65g TX Springs. Durock stabs lubed with 205g0 as well. The other pcb has been desoldered once with an FR301 desoldering gun. Will leave the 3mm foam liner in the bottom.The POM plate is also burger mounted with 50A durometer O-rings. Second PCB will not include the stabs.~~

Hello,

Prices include shipping to CONUS only. Will consider discounts for bulk purchases.

I am clearing out some of the inventory that I do not use.

The Red Samurai 60% Bundle and Massdrop x OLKB Planck Bundle are being sold individually as bundles only; not willing to split each one up. The Red Samurai 60% Bundle is already soldered and assembled, just needs to be put into a case.

Please note that the Planck bundle is missing 1 Gateron Brown switch, and the Tex case is missing 1 screw. The Planck board is MX hotswap so you can easily throw any MX style switches in there.

All the items listed here were either never used, or used for a week then put away.

The Qxp is built with Tealios v2 which are filmed and lubed with 205g0. And has Pre-Retool GMK Screw in Stabs. The Board itself is flawless. No scratches dents/etc... looking to get $500 OBO +shipping( this means “ or best offer below my price not above”)Available

The Second one is a E6 v2 I had gotten it from another user on mechmarket about 3 months ago and I don’t know if it was falsely advertised. Or maybe it just got damaged in shipping it has a rather large dent on the bottom left side.( front of Keeb on bottom) But otherwise it’s beautiful. No other scratches or dents.

Hi Everyone,

&#x200B;

I'm looking to find a new home for the following:

* PLA75 gasket mount 75% keyboard with Koala switches - Koala switches lubed with Krytox GPL203g0 and spring swapped with TX Keyboards' 60g springs. GMK Screw-in stabilizers lubed with superlube. PCB is KBD75 v2 with USB-C. I messed up during assembly and ended up drilling through the upper left hole of the bottom piece, resulting in no screws being used for upper left and upper right (to even things out). Upper middle screw is in place, and there are no negative effects but I want to call that out for honesty's sake (I have another one with all screws in for comparison so I know there's no adverse effect). I used it for about a month. Also included, is a translucent top piece in case you want to change the look.
* Zap cables detachable USB cables combo - Practically brand new Zap cables made by Zap (Not DIY) which include 1x6' Black main cable with USB-A for host (PC), 1x Black USB-C, 1x Navy USB-C, 1x Purple Diamonds USB-C, 1x Black Micro-USB. Used less than a week. Sorry, I won't break this up; they must sell as a set.
* Craftkey Honeycomb wrist rest (60%) in Dynamic - Used about a month and half, comes in original packaging.
* Niz and JTK Topre-MX sliders combo - I bought these with the intent to do a MX conversion project but that fell apart after I lost interest; 100 2019 Niz sliders, and similar number of JTK sliders including 2U stabilized sliders. All are brand new and never used, and pretty much everything you'd need to convert a Topre board to MX except the space bar stabilizers IIRC. These must sell as a set.
* KBDFans DZ60RGB carbon fiber hotswap plate - Ended up giving away the board before these were delivered.

All prices include shipping:

|Description|Price|Status|

* This isn't FCFS - I'll conduct communication with various interested parties and select a buyer in a few days. Preference will be given to buyers of multiple items.

Hello, mechmarket. Not one or two but three of my end-game boards landed in my hands in the last 3 days... Austin / Sat 75 / No 2 R 1.

After purchasing a TX1800v2 because I wanted a full-sized keyboard, someone sold me an Austin R1 for a good price. I then found someone to sell me a Sat 75 and as well sell me a No 2. R 1 (for a friend). I really appreciate every person in this community who has guided people to me, helped me, and as well been supportive. 

In turn, I will give back to the community the boards I purchased for the price I purchased for OR BEST OFFER (best price below the cost I submit on MM) + shipping. I welcome and discount bundles.

This is not FCFS. I will favor people I've dealt with in the past, people who have reputation. 

**CONUS ONLY**

I will not entertain shipping to other countries. 
Everything requires insurance + signature. No exceptions. 

Some common questions:

* OP, please split GMK Bento bundle? I'll think about it. 

* Can I buy GMK Vaporwave and not Singa? I only have the keys located on the Singa v3. 

* Can I buy Singa without GMK Vaporwave? Sure. NP. 

* Are you selling your Koyu Milk? No.

* Has it sold? If it is struck through, yes.

* Where's my invoice? You'll have it within the next 3 hours.

**I will ship ALL products in a few days! Invoices going out soon**



*LOOKING FOR*

* Please sell me a GMK Olivia ++ light & dark set + rama key + Spacebars(don't care for novelties, but if you can't split the bundle, I'll buy it all). I know it hasn't shipped yet, but when it does, please pm me.

Should clarify. Shipped prices are in the EU, sorry. It's a bit pricier to ship to North America. If you're keen, it will likely cost extra."

**Info**

Trying (one more time) to reduce the number of 60% keyboards, hopefully someone with a high-end WKL TKL is looking for a 60%. I am only looking to trade as this is a great keyboard, and am happy to keep it if a trade does not surface.

512 WKL in great condition - 1/20 units (more info [here](https://atxkb.com/512-wkl-60-kit-Oct-2019/)). Currently built with Gateron Inks (205g0, CWW 62 g springs, TX films), GMK pre-retool screw-in stabilizers (205g0), DZ60 PCB w/ VIA. There are some surface marks on the polycarbonate from general use as well as some tarnish on the brass; I would touch this up before shipping.

I don’t know if my asking price is fair for this set. Part of me don’t want to sell it because it is so nice but I have other things that I want to buy so I should free up some funds.

Good Afternoon /r/mechmarket 

I have a single set of keycaps I'm looking to move today.

**GMK Miami Nights**

~~I picked this set early this year and it's been on my work board since and it's still one of my favorite colorways.  This is the full set that came with the original GB.  The set is older and was used heavily even before me, and thus it has a very decent amount of shine on the alphas and 7U Spacebar.  The spacebar in particular has shine all the way on the right side because the previous owner flipped the spacebar so it's got 2 shine spots.~~  

~~Personally, I don't mind shine on the set.  It is what it is and that's what ABS does, it shines up with use.  I'm not about keeping these things locked up in a closet or not using them.  That's not my thing.  So the set, while pretty, still has a lot of shine on the alphas.  The modifiers have a lot less but it still is there.  Just being completely open about this set.~~  

~~Either way it's a rarer GMK set that looks fantastic and has some decent compatibility.  (I hope they run another round of it one day with more compat)~~  

~~Asking $225 O.B.O. Shipped CONUS with PP Fees included.~~  **SOLD FOR $205 SHIPPED**


Thanks for looking today!

Selling:

* Rose Gold KBD67 MKII - $385 shipped (CONUS) **SOLD**

I've used this board on and off for a few months, although it has become just a switch tester more recently. It comes assembled with a hotswap PCB, gmk stabs (lubed with dialetric grease and finish line), and custom cut case+plate foam (only compatible with hotswap). The brass plate has marks from swapping switches, but they aren't noticeable when it is fully built. There are also some faint marks on the case itself that I tried capturing in the photos. The brass weight still looks new.

Feel free to PM questions, thanks!"

Hello, Mechmarket! For sale are three boards that I just don't use anymore. All boards are built.

Shipping is CONUS only. This is firm, I don't want to deal with international shipping with the state of the world. Payment will require Paypal Goods and Services - you will be invoiced.

&#x200B;

**~~Mysterium~~**

~~Built with Gateron Clears, Gateron Yellows on alpha-cluster mods and space bar. Switches lubed with G-501, Durock stabilizers lubed with GPL 205g0. GON cone feet.~~

~~Board is wired for a single-color 5v strip for the component area but is not currently installed (See album for test fitting with white strip). Positive and ground wires soldered underneath to the +5v and GND ISP header pins.~~

~~Case was cut by Ponoko - Transparent black acrylic with POM plate.~~

~~Price: $250 shipped CONUS~~ Sold and shipped for asking

&#x200B;

**~~Switch Couture Alice~~**

~~Matte black (Murder Alice) with frosted acrylic bottom plate. Built with Gateron Blacks lubed with G-501, C3 Equalz stabilizers lubed with GPL 205g0.~~

~~PCB is a Rev1 White Project Keyboard Alice PCB (Mini-USB).~~

~~Price: $250 shipped CONUS~~ Sold and shipped for asking

&#x200B;

**~~Rev 5. High Profile Planck (With Caps)~~**

~~Powder coated white. Sorbothane sphere rear feet (approximately 5 degree typing angle). Built with cherry-picked (heh) retooled Cherry MX Blacks, spring swapped to 65g bottom-out, lubed with GPL205g0. Pre-tooled GMK stabilizer on the space bar lubed with GPL205g0. White LEDs soldered under switches.~~

~~Board is soft-mounted with perforated shelf liner between the PCB and bottom case, nylon nuts on the screws from the underside.~~

~~Comes with RAMA White GRID caps, and (as a bonus because I don't care to deal with selling them) bags of DSA caps, Planck set in a separate bag (backspace key as space). The DSA Caps will come with the planck.~~

~~Price: 170 shipped.~~  Sold and shipped for $150

&#x200B;

Prices are negotiable. Trades considered. Combination of trade+paypal either way will be considered.

Hi there. I'm looking to trade my PC Neuron (+PayPal if needed) for a ***65% or Alice clone kit*** ***in black, white, or PC*** around the same value. 

 The Neuron is built with Fei Matchas in Cherry Housings (soldered) + Sakurios on the spacebars (gmk stabs), 5mm brass plate, and includes the entire ePBT blanks set. 

I am also looking for any **Brass Ramaworks** artisans, or any ETF's in the **White Gold Tower** colorway.

Mainly looking to trade but will do something around $400 + shipping if you really need the Neuron. 

Thanks for looking, please comment before pm, no chat please. :)"

Selling a KBDFans 67v2 mkii solderable board. Comes already built with lubed and filmed gateron yellows. Features Krytox 205g0 on housings with 105 on springs. 
Stabs are c3 lubed with 205g0 on sliders and dielectric grease on wires. 

Asking 400 USD shipped OBO

Minimal use has a sound test [here](https://youtu.be/2Y8jaysVmRs)

Sale pending

MT3 serika set is unused other than to mount for pics and to conduct a sound test shown here. Numpad is still sealed. 
Includes: Katakana alphas, modifiers, geometries, arrows.

Numpad, Katakanas, and Modifiers are sold

Selling arrows kit for 50 GBP shipped. 
Geometries kit for 55 GBP shipped. 

GMK Nautilus R1 sealed + spacebars kit (a little bit different to the R2 you're welcome to check out both sets and persue whichever you choose)

Asking 375 USD shipped OBO. Might be up to trade for other GMK sets.

Unholy pandas. 35 USD shipped. x90. Sold

GMK 8008 + Deskmat. 8008 only mounted once for a sound test. The tray is still functional but has a crack on one of the sides. The new gmk trays are notoriously bad. You're literally better off getting them in a bag. 
300 GBP shipped. 

Should clarify. Shipped prices are in the EU, sorry. It's a bit pricier to ship to North America. If you're keen, it will likely cost extra."

Today is a very sad day. I didn't want to see this board off originally, but last night I spent 3 hours lubing my newly bought Holy Pandas with the intention of rebuilding this Matrix 8xv2.2, only to unfortunately find out that Holy Pandas don't fit the tight plate cutout of this board. So now I'm on /r/mm looking to trade this board for an alternate grail board that would support these end-game Holy Pandas that I've wanted to make for so long. Please help make my dream come true by PMing me with grail board offers :(

Board is built with lubed inks, lubed and clipped and band-aid modded GMK screw-ins. Has one very very small ding shown in timestamps, completely unnoticeable during use or even on photos for glamour shots (you can only notice it if you zoom in close enough or run your finger over the ding).

I'm NOT looking for anything from KBDFans or stuff like Think6.5, Savage65 and Iron165 (lol). I will prioritize trades, obviously, but if you must buy it out, I'm putting this at $1600 (High price to discourage buyers). Also, I will wait 3-4 days until I sell it to the first person offering to buy the board, as I still want to look for trades.

I also have a black Duck Viper v2 with DP60 per-key RGB and RGB underglow built with Zealios v2. I'm not looking to sell this board, but if it helps me get a trade for my grail, I'm willing to do a 2:1 trade (matrix + viper for one of your grails). However if you wanna do a 2:1, I expect to trade both for something like a TGR (Jane/Alice) or Keycult.

Thanks for looking and have a nice day!

Keycaps for a 60% layout (tsangan) have been mounted and typed on for several hours before taking off. The 7u and 6.25u spacebars have some warp, but I didn't experience any significant problems when using the 7u one.

Update: [I have the replacement spacebars](https://i.imgur.com/4cGKOYY.jpg) from Drop. The [7u spacebar](https://i.imgur.com/9Nf9s21.jpg) has very minimal warping (I don't see it being a big issue) and the [6.25u spacebar](https://i.imgur.com/UVwm34X.jpg) has no warp at all from what I can tell.

Both spacebars, warp and no warp, will be included.

This will not be FCFS. I am in Canada, so shipping within the country is definitely faster at the moment, but I'm happy to ship to the US and I'm willing to entertain the idea of international shipping (though I'd have to check shipping prices). These prices include the cheapest tracked shipping through Canada Post / USPS, but if you'd like better/faster shipping we can figure something out!

Ladies and Gents,


TX84 Antique Copper:
Since I got a TX84 milk white I need to move this tx84 antique copper. Comes unbuilt with PCB and brass plate. Apart from some minor pitting on the base this board is in great condition. Mild patina but I can tell it’s quite uniform. Lovely board to type on but can get even better if you wanna build it on a POM plate. I did so for my TX84 milk and it sounds amazing. I can give you the plate file if you need.
SOLD $500 - includes shipping from Singapore using Fedex priority.

Changed my mind on a build, so just looking to offload this awesome case for the Leopold F660-C. It weighs about 6 pounds, comes with original box, and tool kit. 

Basically in brand new condition, only want to recoup the money I spent on it. Asking $350 SHIPPED CONUS.

*EDIT* 
The mizu deskmat AND novelties are already sold. The post hasn't even been up for an hour and i've had literally 20 pms about them. I'm sorry to everyone who couldnt get it in time,but damn, i didn't expect that many pms. Sorry guys. :(

*EDIT 2.0* 
I got overwhelmed by messages and i had to reject MANY PEOPLE asking for the mizu sets. I'm sorry to everyone who was just a few minutes late to the sale. I did not expect so many people to want them,especially after less than an hour the post went up. I hope you can forgive me and someone else shows up on r/mm and actually gets you what you want. Good luck everyone!

Hello r/mechmarket.

Have some stuff left over from previous sales and since i won't use them, i've decided to let them go.

Most of these are sealed because they were planned for a build, but were never even opened. I added links if you wanna see how the keycaps/mats look like.

Prices are with paypal fees but without shipping costs estimated.
For artisans,it's about 10$ to ship it anywhere in the world (depending on your location). 
For the keycap sets, you have to let me know your location first so i can estimate the amount of the shipping costs.

\^\^\^\^\^Timestamp and pictures\^\^\^\^\^

\*\* The Niu Mini has been sold!\*\* The keycaps are still available. Note, they are all ortho or ergodox sets!

Hi all,I'm selling off some of my collection (I'd like to start moving towards my end game). I would prefer to sell within the EU, since I've had terrible experiences recently, with mail getting lost from outside the EU.

Prices don't include shipping, but I think shipping within the EU is around 6 to 8 euros, with tracking. I'll look it up for you, when I know where you want it sent to :)

Edit: when I originally wrote my listing, I went off the prices from my original invoice, but got the prices mixed up by looking at the wrong kit. Sorry, guys! I have adjusted the prices now.

Keycaps:

1. Round 1 SA Vilebloom ortho: Has been mounted and been used for a couple of months. Still in perfect condition. Was mounted on the Niu Mini listed below
Price: 78 Euros

2. Round 1.5 SA Vilebloom ortho: Kit is identical to that offered in round 1. These ship in plastic baggies, so these are new in bag and have never been opened or mounted. Perfect, brand new condition  
Price: 93 Euros

3. Round 1.5 SA Vilebloom ergodox: Kit is also identical to the ergodox kit offered in round 1. These ship in plastic baggies, so these are new in bag and have never been opened or mounted. Perfect, brand new condition  
Price: 98 Euros

4. GMK Red Samurai ortho: From when these were just an in-stock item on drop.com (well before round 2, that is currently running). They have been mounted and used lightly, with very minimal amounts of shine. Honestly, the only noticeable shine is on one of the space bars, and you have to really look for it. In it's original packaging. Your chance to get OG GMK packaging for Red Samurai lol  
Price: 110 Euros

-----

Keyboard: SOLD!

1. Niu mini, silver alu (maybe grey? I can't tell from kbdfans website), frosted acrylic base:40% ortho layout.Built with 78g Zilent switches and a transparent dampening mat.Full RGB underglow, which is as bright as the sun when at max brightness.Sounds incredible with the zilents and especially with the SA Vilebloom caps I had mounted on it.This guy has served me well as a mini little gaming pad. Fully programmable with QMK, I had the perfect layout for gaming.Sadly, time to let this great little board go, and onwards towards end game. No blemishes or anything that I can see.  
Price: 160 Euros SOLD

Quick info on the Zilent switches: 78g sounds like it would be really heavy, but personally, I find them perfect. I do type heavy handed but people with a lighter hand just wouldn't be bottoming out as much. This would lend itself even more to the silent aspect of these switches. They sound so good and a really nice, muted thock. I will be getting these bad boys again. The bump starts right at the top, but it's fairly long and rounded. So good.

Thanks, and stay safe!"

[timestamp/album](https://imgur.com/gallery/T2Yv9AB)

Wanted to clear my shelf for some of my other boards coming in soon. Not really looking for any trades ATM as I have ""too many boards"" according to my girlfriend...

I absolutely adore both keyboards but I have no choice but to let these go.

Some details about the boards prior to the listing:

\- **QXP - HHKB layout, Navy blue, brass weight & Plate, CannonKeys AN-C PCB (desoldered once).** Purchased from another member here for $480ish + shipping. I wasn't informed of the scratch on the weight when I purchased it (which I heard many QXP's suffered from? not sure) but it's about an inch long and visible in certain lighting and didn't bother me too much. Still I want to be as clear as possible when selling here. Currently built with creamios (NK Creams stem inside Zeal housing) - **Stems were lubed with 205g0, springs were lubed with 105g0 - springs swapped to 67g TX springs, filmed with Tx clear films.**

[SOUND TEST QXP](https://youtu.be/6XPfNNbQPXc)

**I can sell it to you built as is or desolder** cleanly for you(Hakko FR301 - pcb will be tested prior to shipping)

&#x200B;

here's some background on the QXP  [https://brianlee.blog/2018/12/29/best-of-keyboards-2018/](https://brianlee.blog/2018/12/29/best-of-keyboards-2018/)

&#x200B;

**- Freyr TKL - Red Weight, red aluminum plate -** I think this was my first ever mechmarket keyboard purchase. Purchased from another user here for \~$460 a few months ago. No visible flaws - in pretty great condition.

\*\*EDIT: realized there's not much detail on this board available - there are a handful of these in circulation bc the prototypes were made but never went to GB. The Keyboard is top mounted AFAIK. Sounds and feels great for it's price :)

Currently built with NOS Vintage blacks with stock springs, lubed stems with 205g0 and springs with 105g0, tx filmed (Ran out of black films halfway through the lube job and only had white, so about half of them have white film) The NOS vintage blacks were purchased from another user here (ru\_mi) and these switches are amazing. Highly recommended.

[SOUND TEST FREYR](https://youtu.be/DDKaAZntWCw)

I'd prefer not the desolder this one but if you really request it - I can make it happen.

The stock PCB has been desoldered once.

If the item isn't crossed off, it's available. I update as soon it's sold.

Not FCFS - prioritizing bundles/local sales (92782 zip code) and people I've had the pleasure of dealing with before.

None of the keyboards come with keycaps.

Sound test can be recorded if requested. Shipping is for CONUS - prices will differ if outside CONUS.

## Updates

* **~~June 14 11:15 utc~~**~~: I responded to messages for the better part of 4 hours. I'm going to call it for the night and try to send out the first round of invoices before I got to sleep. Unfortunatly I made a mistake in my polaris listing. I forgot to mention that I have an extra PCB and raise the price accordingly. I'll update the listing and notify the buyer before I send an invoice for it. For those who are curious, I recieved 58 legitimate offers in the first 24h {23: containing polaris, 22: containing Jamon, 7 containing necro, 7 containing TMOv2, 6 containing sirius, 5 containing Nolive switches}. I had no idea Jamon was in demand.~~
* **~~June 15 14:07 utc~~**~~: I sent an invoice for a bundle including the polaris last night. The buyer has 24h to pay. Several bundles will be split differently depending on the result. I also sent invoices for individual items and small bundles that were not affected. Unfortunatly I made another mistake in my original listing. I listed GMK Jamon for 140 EUR when I should have listed it for 165 EUR. I paid 165 EUR (rounded up after shipping and fees) for Jamon from a drop re-cap. I will sell it for 165 EUR and warn the buyer about the change before I send them an invoice. The Jamon buyer has not been determined yet because the next polaris buyer in line requested Jamon too.~~
* **~~June 16 02:12 utc~~**~~: A bundle including Polaris has been sold. I've sent a second round of invoices to buyers including TMOv2, both  Sirius, GMK Jamon, and Nolive switches. Everything sold in the first 24h is packed and labelled and will be shipped tomorrow. Lead time from payment to shipment is 1-2 days as I only have time to go to the post office once per day in the late afternoon this week.~~
* **~~June 17 17:23 utc~~**~~: The last round of invoices have been paid or cancelled and the first two rounds of sales have been shipped.~~
* **~~June 18 00:52 utc~~**~~: All ongoing negotiations have been resolved. All offers that were not accepted have been notified. Sorry to everyone who didn't get what they wanted.~~

Stabs are c3 lubed with 205g0 on sliders and dielectric grease on wires.

Has not really been used at all. Conducted a sound test using mt3 serika caps [here](https://youtu.be/Kg8lWQh2Rqc).

Sound test is indeed terrible audio quality, but it's the best I can manage with the kit I have. Personally, I do think it sounds quite thoccy and nice in person. These sound tests are mainly there to get a rough idea of what to expect. No discernable ping. Etc. 

I unfortunately do not have a gmk set to test it on in hand. 

MT3 serika set is unused other than to mount for pics and to conduct the sound test shown here. Numpad is still sealed. 
Includes: Katakana alphas, modifiers, geometries, arrows, and numpad

**Switch Couture ElectroType 87 WKL Frosted - ~~$160 shipped~~ SOLD**

- Had plans to build this but I have my eyes on another board right now so I'm gonna sell this. Case only; doesn't come with a PCB. Needs an h87a PCB if you do purchase. The board isn't brown, you have to peel that layer off. Will ship in the original packaging.

- From the January restock, so the shade of the dark blue is lighter. Since deskmats are very heavy, expect shipping to be anywhere from $12-18 based on where you live.

[Extra Pics of Canoe](https://imgur.com/a/YSlLyWy)

&#x200B;

I've got a built PC Canoe that I'm looking to trade for either a TMO50v2 , ANY RAMA keebs, GMK Bento or Handarbeit base kits (with trays). **I'm almost prepared to give my soul for a TMO50v2 though so please help me out!**

Not too concerned with condition, so slight imperfections are okay. 

Hotswap or soldered is fine  - **unbuilt would be the dream**. I can top up anything with Paypal (and visa versa). Switches aren't a requirement, but I would prefer to trade for a board that has linears.

**The Build:**

The PC Canoe has a full alu plate built with gateron ink blacks lubed with Krytox 205g0, durock stabs also lubed with 205g0. Switches feel and sound great - I only have access to an iPhone, so an unprofessional sound test can be organised upon request :) 

The board is soldered - it was my first solder job so be aware that everything works perfectly, but it isn't the cleanest of solder jobs :) 

The board is in pristine condition! I am also the first owner - so will be traded with original packaging. 

It will not come with keycaps or micro usb cable. Keycaps can be discussed if you like. Not looking for any PayPal offers ATM for the Canoe.

**Please note that there is also currently a GB for extra PCBs and plates for the Canoes! Check here: ""**[**Mechlovin' Kanu GB**](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/h7n2ok/gb_mechlovin_kanu_canoe_v1_compatible_pcb_plates/)**""**

&#x200B;

I also have a **Tada68** with a black plastic case, built by KBDfans with stock gateron black silents (although they aren't too quiet). I would prefer to keep the caps. Looking to trade or sell for 90 Euros without keycaps, 110 Euros with keycaps? But send me an offer please :) 

And lastly, a GTX 1050 that has been overclocked. Not exaclty sure what that means, but that's what my friend told me who built my PC originally. It has had quite a bit of use for 2 years for rendering, but works perfectly. Does not come with original packaging, and I'm also not too keen to clean it as it is a little dusty. Looking to add to trade.

EU or UK offers only please. I've had way too may issues with US shipping lately.

Prices excl shipping.

Please comment before PM - thanks!!"

Good Afternoon /r/mechmarket 

I have 2 keysets I'm looking to sell today.

**GMK Miami Nights**

Kitting can be found here:

https://www.originativeco.com/products/miami-nights?_pos=4&_sid=12f0f314e&_ss=r

I picked this set early this year and it's been on my work board since and it's still one of my favorite colorways.  This is the full set that came with the original GB.  The set is older and was used heavily even before me, and thus it has a very decent amount of shine on the alphas and 7U Spacebar.  The spacebar in particular has shine all the way on the right side because the previous owner flipped the spacebar so it's got 2 shine spots.  

Personally, I don't mind shine on the set.  It is what it is and that's what ABS does, it shines up with use.  I'm not about keeping these things locked up in a closet or not using them.  That's not my thing.  So the set, while pretty, still has a lot of shine on the alphas.  The modifiers have a lot less but it still is there.  Just being completely open about this set.  

Either way it's a rarer GMK set that looks fantastic and has some decent compatibility.  (I hope they run another round of it one day with more compat)  

Asking $225 Shipped CONUS with PP Fees included.

~~**SA Ice Cap**~~

~~I have the TKL with Text Kit, Alternate Text Kit, Orange (OAX) ESC Key, and 4 Arrows in Grey (GD)~~

~~I've had this set for quite a while now, and it always gets a few days of usage on different boards before I realize that I don't like uniform SA profile.~~  

~~The kit compat I have covers almost all TKL, 65%, 75%, 60% and even some 40% boards with almost perfect legend compat.  There's very little shine on these (The external flash on my DSLR is causing the reflection in the keycaps in the timestamp) and they feel soft almost since they are PBT.  However I just fell out of love with them.~~

~~I'm asking $120 Shipped CONUS with PP Fees included.  (Buying all of this brande new from PMK is $140 + Shipping FYI)~~

Hey all, I’m selling this set of brand new Night Runner Base, Novelties, and Space Bars for $390 as a bundle shipped via USPS. (Assuming mainland or local shipping, more if shipped outside of US) 

PayPal G&S only.

I love the look of this set, especially the novelties and the alphanumerics, but got a different one while I was waiting during all of the delays.

[Le Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/8jUDS8j)

I recently acquired another end game board \[FOR NOW\] and I am looking to sell off my Rama Koyu Tank Lite to fund my next board. This has been my daily driver for the last few months and it has been the dream. A wonderful typing experience. It is a two piece unit where the top is a single ALL BRASS piece. This thing really is a TANK. God forbid you actually put the additional RAMA weight in this.

*ahem.... BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSS*

Ok now that we got that out of the way, lets dive into the board.

I have acquired a Rama Sound Dampener and two spare bases in different Colours, Green & Purple. Red is currently on the board. In the board I have installed ZEAL stabilizers lubed with 205g0. The timestamp shows switches in the board, these are **NOT** included. I kept them in for showcasing a gmk set on the board.

~~I am likewise looking to sell my Base set of SA Bliss. Used it once and I just cant get behind SA. Not my jam. :(~~

I am looking to sell only, no trades at this time. CONUS ONLY BTW. At the end of the day I dont want to bother shipping to the EU or ASIA, sorry homies.

Comment before you PM. **Note that this listing is not FCFS, users with some form of trading history and/or verified PayPal will be preferred.**

**ALL ITEMS SOLD - Very pleased to see the Tank go to a good home.**

Hey, got some stuff I wanna sell/trade, PLEASE READ DETAILS BEFORE PMing. You know how it is, PM before commenting, pls PM, I don't understand how reddit chat works and I don't think the app I use most of the time even supports it. 

I listed some of this stuff before, didn't end up selling much stuff last time as it was right when shelter in place started. That's where the older pics/timestamp came from. I'm happy to provide additional pictures upon request, although I go to work during the day so I won't be able to send immediately. I'm comfortable to go to the post office again, so I'm here to unload some stuff. I've bought a lot of keyboards/keyboard stuff in the last few years and am looking to thin a bit and maybe even end 2020 with less keyboards than I started with now that I really know what I like. 

I'm local to the Bay area 95126 and 95008 are where I'm usually at, there will be some discount for local. All prices listed include shipping, except trays which I don't think it's worth shipping. Mostly FCFS, but I'd prefer to deal with people with more confirmed trades, especially on the higher value items. 

It's late and I'll probably sleep soon, so don't be upset if I don't respond until the morning.

[more pics](https://imgur.com/a/fXlD0qH)

~~I got this thing and while it's a very nice board, it's not for me. I don't need a 75 percent, or knob or screen. Seriously though, it types like a dream. I used it for 2 days and decided it wasn't for me. It's built with chisto-lubed zeal stabs and the older tangerine switches (not the new translucent ones, these have black bottom and milky top) lubed with 3204 and filmed. I ran out of switches for the 3 on the right, those are lubed gateron glow switches, which feel similar. I used a 60% MKUltra foam for that area and added a bit of foam to supplement by the three keys on the right, and a piece of foam from Michael's that I cut to fit under the PCB. JTK toxic is not included, but the case it came with and knob are. It's got the blue screen. **$1100 or trades or offer I guess** I don't particularly want to sell, but for the right price...~~SOLD

~~I don't know why I thought I wanted this. I don't like sets where the mods are multiple colors, I guess I thought this would be the one I would like. I have the base, signs and blocks kits. Never even been put on a keyboard.  **$300 or trades**~~SOLD

.

**Dead (Round 1 on geekhack) CA66**

I ought to take more pics of this, if you want them I can. 

~~Before I start I want to make it very clear up front: **the PCB is dead and it has stem breaker box switches!!** What a sad story. I was super hype on this board, and the hottest thing out were the box thick click switches. I got it all put together, and found I wasn't super into the acoustics (some foam in there would probably go a long way for the ping). I used it for a bit, and then found out that the switches would break the gmk stems and were too heavy for me, so it sat with the keyset that was on it for quite some time. A few months ago my girlfriend wanted to use a clicky board, and she told me it didn't work. I did some diagnosis, and it seems the PCB is just straight dead. I did some research and it looks like this was a common problem, and the people that got the round 1 were able to get free replacements, but it was too late for me and I never got a response. I've heard that there are replacements out there on like taobao or something, but I don't like the acoustics so I haven't looked into it much. I think a guy on geekhack is working on a replacement too? It is built with the brass plate, and the aluminum plate pictured is included too. It's got a lil dust but no scratches or anything. **$300**.~~SOLD

**Massdrop x OLKB Acute keyset**

Base + extra colors. Never used or even mounted. **$50**.

**Tai Hao Alps Keyset**

.

**Massdrop inifity60**

As pictured, includes black PBT DSA blanks. Has a cherry MX Blue on escape, and otherwise is Matias click. This was the first kit I ever built, and I really just don't care for the switches. Great starter board! I only took one pic, but I've listed it before, take a look through my post history for more pics.  **$79 Price reduced!!** Someday someone will take this cool lil board. 

.

**GMK and JTK trays**

~~I think pictured are 4 GMK and 6 JTK, I definitely have more of each in the closet, can post timestamp of those too if you're interested. I prefer to store in freezer bags. **$4 each?** I don't think these are worth shipping, so local only. If you buy one of the keyboards or metropolis local you can just have as many as you want.~~ Pending

**Want**

I got this really beautiful set with a really nice numpad that I want to show off, and I don't have a keyboard with a numpad to put it on. I'd really like an HBCP to show off handarbeit on. I also might be interested in a blue-grey QXP. Other than that  I guess I might be open to trade for interesting TKLs or 60%s, feel free to DM me with reasonable inquiries."

This is from a build for a friend that went horrifically wrong. It took four months to get everything together, and when he went to exchange his spacebar and enter key for their accent colors, he popped the wire for both of them. 

After 4 months and a whole lot of money, I wanted him to come out of it with something more than a broken keyboard, so I thought I’d make a post here. 

The board itself is in pretty much flawless condition, it is built with stock creams and lubed everglide stabilizers. 

We’re open to trading the Savage65 for basically any other built 65%, granted it comes with caps (preferable Cherry profile or GMK). Tofu65, KBD67 Mk1/2, NK65 are just some examples, but we’re open to everything. We can add paypal as well depending on the trade.

HFO is barely used, was basically mounted for pictures. Minimal has been used but barely (if any) shine. Held it up to the window earlier to see if there's any discernible shine and I couldn't see any. But to stay on the conservative side, lets say the minimal has 'minimal' shine.

as title states, looking to trade these sets for other gmk sets. Not quite sure what I want so just lemme know what you have and maybe we can work something out. Also open to trading these towards a board or something. Been bored waiting on some GBs and been wanting to build something.

So today I'm going to be testing the waters with my Duck Viper v2, and TGR X Signa Unikorn.  Both keyboards are absolutely stunning.  As of right now I am looking to see what trades I can get for the boards.  I would be interested in strait trades, 2 for 1's, and almost anything else you can think of.

**\*\* Looking to sell viper outright now**

&#x200B;

* [Duck Viper v2](https://imgur.com/a/MSAzdIr) \-  3 total PCBs, 1 Un-built Duck PCB brand new, 1 Built DP 60 PCB w CF plate and Black gat inks, 1 Duck PCB w SS plate and INVR HPs. Duck PCB currently built had half the LEDs give out(not sure what the issue is, could be fixable), so the brand new PCB would be yours to build as you chose. Extra Duck Feet. [Custom brass weight](https://imgur.com/a/OVSuRbk) from original GB with Viper and Eagle etched into the brass. Condition 10/10, This board is flawless.

Wants for the Viper -  Unikorns, Key65s, RAMAs, e6.5s, other various high end boards.

\*\**I will take cash for this* \- $**1050obo**

&#x200B;

* [~~TGR x Signa Unikorn~~](https://imgur.com/a/Te1ufyw) ~~- This board was sold to me as silver, but I would call it more of a grey, board is in overall amazing condition except for one minor nick on the front of the case. Board is srill absolutely stunning.  Comes with 1 cleanly desoldered PCB and 2 brass plates. Comes with original box. I am honestly in love with this board, just seeing what else is out there right now because I am starting to have a collection of 60%s and want to diversify a little.~~

~~Wants for the Unikorn - RAMAs, E6.5s, Matrix, other various high end boards.~~

~~\*\*~~ *~~I will take cash for this~~* ~~- $~~**~~1050 SOLD~~**

~~I'm also interested in trading both of these boards for higher ends - s75s, 1.2OGs, KC's.~~

HFO is barely used, was basically mounted for pictures. Minimal has been used but barely (if any) shine. Held it up to the window earlier to see if there's any discernible shine and I couldn't see any. But to stay on the conservative side, lets say the minimal has 'minimal' shine.

Was going through some stuff today and I realized I really need to start getting rid of some stuff. It's taking up too  much space, and now that I've found out what I really like I simply don't need a lot of it anymore. 

**The Keyboard is TriC60**. It is a low profile 60% with acrylic layer and LEDs built with an aluminum plate + DZ60 + 67g Zeal V2s. It's nice and quiet and it was my first build. I love it but I gotta let it go. There is a crack in the acrylic layer, but you don't see it when the board is put together. I didn't even realize until I was taking everything apart.

~~Elephant S7 White/Black~~ | ~~$750 + shipping~~ Sold
~~Cannonkeys Instant60 PCB Tsangan Edition~~ | ~~$60 + shipping~~ Sold


Up for sale today is a brand new, only taken out of the package to make sure everything is perfect white top/black bottom Elephant S7 R2. I received this a couple a days ago. This is one of only 2 White/Black S7's from the most recent GB.

Additionally I have a Cannonkeys Instant60 PCB in Tsangan. This is a fixed layout (split backspace/split Rshift) pcb, and is meant more for HHKB builds, but is compatible with standard 60% cases, just with the 2 split sections. 100% hotswap, full RGB key backlighting/underglow, fully VIA compatible and flashed with a VIA compatible firmware. The GMK screw-in stabs are lubed and included in the purchase.

CONUS buyers will be given preference, shipping is not included in price. Please be aware that shipping the S7 will be quite expensive (think $40, I paid $105 in shipping originally). Offers asking to include shipping in the cost will be ignored, it's not a price I'm willing to absorb.

Item | Description| Price | Available?

~~102x SKCM Damped Creams~~ | Desoldered them from an AEK. Fairly good condition, still snappy. Another cheap option to try ALPS switches.| ~~20€~~| Sold
99x SKCM Blues |Got them from E3Eeves a long time ago. Have been ultrasonically cleaned and feel pretty good. They are all consistent although some may require a small adjustment for the tactile leaf. I'd rate them a 7/10 condition. If you have donor tops or use the nexus housings can easily reach 9/10 condition since tactile leaves are pristine. |190€ (roughly 2€ each)|Yes
~~70x Nexus sliders and top housings~~|Bought lots more than needed to help with the group buy, but have plenty and more than I'll ever need. They have been already filed down to not bind with GMK caps and the sliders shaved down to not crack keycaps. They are ready to mount and use!|~~70€~~|Sold|

**GMK WoB w/Teal Accents - $100 SOLD**

[Pictured on a built board here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/evr20g/a_simple_whitefox/). Accents include 6.25u and 7u spacebar, arrow keys, win keys. Small amount of shine on the 6.25u black spacebar. No shine on the accent spacebars.

**Crazy Numpad - $50 SOLD**

Was going to wire this to a Teensy or similar to use this, but I don't have the time right now. Can provide the row and column matrix information upon request if anyone else wants to do this. It was designed to work with the Apple II and uses a very simple matrix.

**NIZ PLUM 82 RGB Bluetooth - $150 sold**

I was going to dome swap this, but NIZ is completely out of dome sheets right now and I don't want to go through the pain of trying align BKEs on it (NIZ keyboards are pain to replace domes if you can't do the entire sheet). The stock domes are extremely quiet and pleasant, but I prefer ultra heavy tactility. This is $50 off what it would cost brand new and it is in amazing shape, barely used. RGB and Bluetooth.

Good Afternoon /r/mechmarket 

**Before anyone asks, I got the little bins from The Container Store.  :)**

I have 2 keysets I'm looking to trade today for other keysets.  I am not looking to sell either of these at this time.  

**GMK Miami Nights**

Kitting can be found here:

https://www.originativeco.com/products/miami-nights?_pos=4&_sid=12f0f314e&_ss=r

I picked this set early this year and it's been on my work board since and it's still one of my favorite colorways.  This is the full set that came with the original GB.  The set is older and was used heavily even before me, and thus it has a very decent amount of shine on the alphas and 7U Spacebar.  The spacebar in particular has shine all the way on the right side because the previous owner flipped the spacebar so it's got 2 shine spots.  

Personally, I don't mind shine on the set.  It is what it is and that's what ABS does, it shines up with use.  I'm not about keeping these things locked up in a closet or not using them.  That's not my thing.  So the set, while pretty, still has a lot of shine on the alphas.  The modifiers have a lot less but it still is there.  Just being completely open about this set.  

Either way it's a rarer GMK set that looks fantastic and has some decent compatibility.  (I hope they run another round of it one day with more compat)  

Looking for other GMK Sets as trade, particularly GMK Space Cadet or something that can go well with a dark grey board. However I'm open to other sets, just offer and we can maybe work something out.

**SA Ice Cap**

Kitting can be found here:

https://pimpmykeyboard.com/sa-ice-cap-keyset/

I have the TKL with Text Kit, Alternate Text Kit, Orange (OAX) ESC Key, and 4 Arrows in Grey (GD)

I've had this set for quite a while now, and it always gets a few days of usage on different boards before I realize that I don't like uniform SA profile.  

The kit compat I have covers almost all TKL, 65%, 75%, 60% and even some 40% boards with almost perfect legend compat.  There's no shine on these and they feel soft almost since they are PBT.  However I just fell out of love with them.

I'm looking for either Sculpted SA Keysets for trade, or I'm open to other keysets in Cherry or OEM profile.  (Maybe DSA depending on what you have)



Have | Want | Available?
---|---|----
GMK Miami Nights | Other keysets | Yes
SA Ice Cap | Other keysets | Yes

Only looking to trade within CONUS at this time.  Each of us will trade paypal with a small amount to have for trade protection and shipping tracking/notifications.  

As always please comment before PM.

Thanks for looking and have a fantastic rest of the day!

Hey again, [r/mm](https://old.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/)

This time I'm looking for something specific: [Strangelove Keypora](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5ba3cec929f2cc0d91dbe9b2/1582629105357-CA0CQDIY7LKVIB65EP8S/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLkXF2pIyv_F2eUT9F60jBl7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0iyqMbMesKd95J-X4EagrgU9L3Sa3U8cogeb0tjXbfawd0urKshkc5MgdBeJmALQKw/DSC01347.jpg?format=750w)

As you can tell from the timestamp album, I'm a little bit of a DitF fan. I really want to try to obtain this Keypora before GMK Darling ships. The Keypora is most definitely going onto the pink Noxary in that album along w/ the Darling set.

All I have to offer is the Cysm No Face Keyby, so I can throw some $$ on top; please help a fellow man of culture out.

Comment before PM; can be reached on discord as pokepowerturtle#7038 as well.

Thanks for looking!

Hi,

I have these things that I am not using.

# WKL Sirius Build/Bundle - 525$ (PENDING)(SOLD) Paypal shipped CONUS/CANADA

~~This is a WKL Sirius with a PVD black polished brass weight. I have built it with a AN-C 60% PCB using NK creams, lubed with 205g0 and filmed (tx films). The stabs are durock transparent stabs lubed with dielectric grease. The build has case foam (3mm mkultra foam). I am selling it as a bundle that includes an extra factory-sealed AN-C 60% PCB (B-Stock so 7u only, only problematic if you want to use it for something else), plate foam, Black FR4 plate, a very small amount of extra screws (2x plate, 6x case) and switches (8x). The bumpons have yellowed (please see timestamp). I am not a smoker and it has not spent time in the sun, so I believe this might just be due to time. The case itself has not yellowed.~~

# (not silver) Grey Tofu Build - 200$ (AVAILABLE) Paypal shipped CONUS/CANADA

This is a Silver Tofu, built with NK Kailh BOX Thick Clicks on a ""skeleton"" carbon fiber plate. The stabs are GMK from before the famed retool, lubed with dielectric grease, and bandaid modded. The switches are post-retool so they do NOT have the stem issue. The case is filled with sorbothane. There is a slight ""banding"" to the silver anodizing that does not show on photos.

Edit 04/06/2020 AM: Redditor corrected me that what I thought was a silver tofu is actually a Grey tofu. 

# Instant60 ANSI sealed PCB - 80$ (PENDING)(SOLD) Paypal shipped CONUS/CANADA

~~Not much to say. Factory sealed Instant60 PCB. This is hotswap (all instant60 are) and ANSI layout.~~

# Notes

If you wish to purchase both the silver tofu and the instant60 pcb, I will remove 20$ from the total.

I will not lower the prices, please do not ask. Please send me a message (DM) and NOT use the reddit chat as my app does not have the chat functionality so you will have a harder time reaching me. The status of the items will be edited on this post (pending when invoice is sent/sold).

Prices are shipped CONUS

**~~GMK Peaches n Cream Base set - $230 -~~** [~~Album~~](https://imgur.com/a/LMNZvWB)~~Pending~~

* Mounted once and used for < 5 hours.
* Will be shipped in original packaging the ""box"" of which is a bit scuffed up as seen in the album.

**~~Gothic 70 Frosted Acrylic (from the first round) - PLEASE READ DETAILS BELOW - $140 -~~** [~~Album~~](https://imgur.com/a/SgppmRo)~~SOLD~~

* So this was essentially my first ""custom"" build and I made a  lot of mistakes. It's built with retooled blacks lubed with 3204 with 55g Catweewee springs (I also clipped the legs on these) and gmk screw in stabs lubed with 205g0. Problems detailed below.
* Essentially the switches are not great. I think I did an ok job at lubing them (followed a guide and whatnot) but some are more scratchy than others. I did not realize that when people build nice boards with retooled blacks they probably go through and pick a really nice batch. I did not do that. That being said they're alright. An enthusiast would notice it but it still feels nice to type on
* Similar to above except with stabs. I was careless and soldered my board without double checking the stabs. I feel that I was very careful in how I clipped lubed and bandaid modded them but when I got the board together I realized the left space stab was completely sticky. I didn't want to completely desolder or cut the case to get it out so after a lot of testing and frustration I just ended up clipping the tops of that stabilizer off as seen in the album. It works fine this way. In fact I have heard of people building this layout without stabs at all, but I am certainly not proud of it.
* Right space stab is a little poor as well  but only slightly.
* All of the switches might not be perfectly flush with the plate. I have tried to fix this and think I got all of them but still putting this disclaimer just in case. I had used these switches before in a hotswap board meaning their legs were cut. The tolerances of the plate were pretty high so nothing really snapped into place and I kind of just tried to hold them in as I soldered. Meh.  I think any remaining problems of this are not noticeable to me at least.
* Led strips on the back work great should be no problems there.
* **TLDR: Board has some definite errors but overall is enjoyable to use and I am only selling because I didn't end up liking the layout. I feel the pricing is fair given that all of the above issues could be fixed by the buyer if they chose to desolder and rebuild themselves and the price itself would not be bad for an unbuilt kit. I am still losing like $50 on this (deserved).**
* I replaced the included bottom screws with some of my own that were longer but I will include the original screws as well.

**Pok3r RGB - $70 -** [Album](https://imgur.com/a/7w2MIEh)

* Cherry MX Reds
* Not much to see here. Bought it used as part of a bundle here on mm and used in 1 class for 1 semester last fall and hasn't been touched since. Everything works to my knowledge. Has minimal wear (not none but certainly not a lot)
* CAUTION stabs are very rattly. I realize this is par for the course with these kinds of boards but wanted to warn anyway. LMK if you would like to hear a sound test.

**Coiled USB A to USB C cable - $20 -** [Album](https://imgur.com/a/7BnSQKk)

* Purple/grey paracord (grey on coil/device end and purple on the rest) with purple techflex and purple heatshrink
* Coil is NOT perfect as I hope I've shown in the album.

**~~Invyr UHMWPE stems - $50 -~~** [~~Album~~](https://imgur.com/a/rWHYPcF)   ~~SOLD~~

**ADD ONS (purchase with something else):**

**Misc Switch Parts -$5 -** [Album](https://imgur.com/a/GBtwKUY)

* Not really sure anymore what's in here. Some box switches some gat yellows lubed and unlubed, I think the cream ones are aristotles??? some aliaz... I'm sure there's $5 worth here if you like tinkering with switches.

Hey all, hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. 

Still looking to trade my silver Unikorn for a black one. I’d prefer to keep my cerakoted weight, but we can work something out if you really want it. 

Also looking to trade Muted for Modern Dolch. Starting to shine a bit on alphas. I’d prefer a straight trade, but I can always add PayPal on my end to balance if needed.

Hi there,

I am selling a few things.

1. ~~**2x GMK Night Runner Base Kit:** One has been opened but never used (which is when I decided to sell them as I can not see myself using it for too long as it's a bit too 'toxic' for my tastes in real life), the other one is still sealed. **Asking 210€ each plus shipping but I am willing to negotiate.**~~ SOLD
2. ~~52x Gateron Greens: Black bottom, clear top. These were soldered in my first ever board but I desoldered them shortly after. **10€ + Shipping but am willing to negotiate.**~~ **SOLD**

I ship using DHL and each shipment will be trackable. [Please consider DHLs general notes during Coronavirus](https://www.dhl.de/en/privatkunden/kampagnenseiten/coronavirus.html) \- shipping to some countries may not be possible at all, or only with a premium.
