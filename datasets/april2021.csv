**Silver case, aluminum plate, aluminum bottom case, PCB, GMK keycaps included.**

The case appears flawless, which I know was not always the case with this buy. It's a solid, impressive weight and that large size everyone likes. I've plugged in the PCB and macOS detected a new keyboard, but I'm unsure how I can test the underglow LCDs—but the aluminum bottom case would make them fairly unnoticeable anyway.

Still have the box with foam for shipping, so it should arrive in the condition I received it. Between what I originally paid + shipping + duty, the asking price is pretty close to what I'm in it for already.

~~**Mill-maxed hotswap steel MF68**~~ SOLD

[Album](https://imgur.com/a/YDUNWfE)

Custom steel 68-key keyboard. One-off 1.5mm steel plates, Millmaxed with 0305, socketed Elite-C, lubed/clipped plate-mount stabs, PCB foam per key. This thing is solid and feels like a tank, but still has a tiny flex when you type on it, due to where the rubber feet are located. I've used this board to test switches, so there are some scuffs on the steel where the switches sit, but they are not visible when being used. There is a 1m USB-C cable plugged into the Elite-C that is used to plug it in.

This board has great base kit compatibility with keycap sets.

The cost to build was $207 (excluding my orig shipping costs).

I'm asking for **$170 shipped** to CONUS.

Keycaps or switches are not included, but I could be convinced to sell the GMK Coral set with it. PM me your offers.

I purchased this Preonic on Nov 29, 2020. It has been my daily driver a few times. I've typed on it full-time for maybe 3-4 weeks.

I've modified it so it has MKUltra 2mm white foam between the case and PCB, and MKUltra 4mm white foam between the PCB and the plate. I've replaced the stock steel plate with a white POM plate from P3DStore, which has a grid layout. It will come with the stock steel plate as well.

It is the acrylic version, so RGB shines through pretty well.

Comes with: Stock steel plate, Stock nut driver, Instructions and keymap pamphlet, Carrying case (never actually used, pandemic lol), Extra white 2mm case foam from MKUltra, Stupidfish Preonic v3 case and plate foam set.

I'm asking for **$125 shipped** to CONUS.

Keycaps: JTK Crylic BoW, Geekart BoW w/ accents, CRP Tulip R3, CRP Desko R2.2 (with the orange) and wkl add-on kit, other BoW Crylic sets, GMK sets yall think would look good with an eWhite Board

fyi, the Maja is a pre-order item at KBDFans; basically on/off in stock every other month at $320 (+shipping which is $20ish from KBDFans). extra PCB is $40 and FR4 plate is $35, putting the total at $415. So this might make sense for you only if you don't wanna wait or want this specific color.

I really like laser colorway and planned to make themed setup with this bundle, but I am saving money for other things, so selling it. Prioritizing eu citizens as VAT is already paid and dandy but can send to usa using premium shipping (it is expensive but people loves this shipping)|

In the future I may offer lube or sodering services, but I still need 6 (on officialy 4) trades to go :)

The listed items is easily reachable and I can photoshoot them every two weeks. However I have more items (switches, pcbs, keyboard cases), which is too much work to photoshoot (it is really annoying to do that every two weeks), but you can ask me more options and I may list more items.

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-60 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct. You can write to me with a similar price I offer, however if this is not my offering price, there is much lower chance I will sell item right away or at all. Especially if price is fixed
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay, but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, ask :)*"

Hey guys, I am freeing up some space for the new projects

All prices include PayPal fees, invoice only. As usual please comment before DM, no chat.

**Worldwide shipping,** will be calculated on request, please DM for that. For artisans around $10, for GMK set should be around $25. For keyboard it should be $40-50, If a keyboard buyer is in the USA I suggest using a more reliable and quicker service, should be around $80

Please note that mail services are still somewhat unpredictable, so shipping might take a long time. Apologies in advance.

&#x200B;

**1.** **Fully built Percent Studio Canoe Gen1 polycarbonate**

[Detailed pics and condition](https://imgur.com/a/oL0UsZ8)

* Built with an aftermarket PCB and an FR4 plate from [Mechlovin](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/gxtgio/gb_mechlovin_kanu_canoe_v1_compatible_pcb_plates/). Fully tuned H1s (Deskeys films, lubed with 203g2, TX 60g springs lubed with TX oil) and C3 stabs. Used Kester solder.
* PCB has support for VIA and many layouts (split backspace, split spacebar etc, see [their post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/gxtgio/gb_mechlovin_kanu_canoe_v1_compatible_pcb_plates/))
* I did enamel infills for the front and back engravings. Front is yellow (matches GMK Serika perfectly), back is dark gray with a subtle golden pearl (see pictures)

Other Parts (extras):

* Original PCB with Bluetooth, there is a battery lead soldered on with a connector. There are 2 spare batteries as well. Didn't use it with BT, never flashed it.
* Custom cut carbon fiber plate for the original PCB.
* Original Alu plate
* ~~Aluminum weight in black color (purchased separately)~~ Sold separately, not in a bundle anymore
* Original Box and stickers.

Condition:

* I accidentally touched a spot on the back weight (near 0) with a solvent, it's shinier than other surfaces. Noticeable under certain angles, see pictures
* Polycarbonate texture is a little different around infills after wiping, noticeable under certain angles, see pictures.
* Otherwise the case is pretty much perfect, might be light signs of use, but no nicks or scuffs.
* Original PCB: it has been soldered and desoldered once, there is one lifted pad on the backside, fixed with a wire, see pictures.
* Mechloving PCB: built once, never desoldered.

&#x200B;

Only sold as a bundle

I can desolder the switches for you (Hakko FR-301) but they will still be a part of the bundle.

Hello! This is the first set I ever bought when I got into the hobby maaaaaaaaaaaaaaany moons ago. Bought it BNIB and instantly unboxed it on arrival to admire my first GMK set. Proceeded to put it in those containers where they've sat for like 8 months now lol. Spend too much on this hobby and never used these so looking to let go. They have never been mounted or typed on, just moved from original packaging to the cases. Cases not included sorry :c Will ship in original packaging.

Rama M60-A Olivia Edition soldered:  Built with lubed and filmed Durock POM linears and Durock V2 stabs. Comes with original packaging and accessories.  GMK Olivia++ Light includes the original trays and the rest of the set. This board is very nicely built and tuned. There are small scratches on the weight (pictured in the last photo). Used for three days and I couldn't get used to not having arrow keys. **Asking $750 shipped to the CONUS via Paypal invoice or $1,000 including GMK Olivia++ Light Keycaps**

If the board sells without the GMK set, I will be willing to sell the keycaps later, but for now I would rather keep them together since they match so nicely.  I'm still trying to find a GMK Laser or GMK Night Runner deskmat as well.

Item | What's included| Asking
---|---|----
[KFE Round 1 + Extras](https://imgur.com/a/tIS0TCd)| Silver KFE from r1 (weights are located inside case, not on the bottom, and the connection is Mini USB). Fantastic board, currently built on a PC plate with some of the smoothest retooled blacks I've ever used. Comes with an additional unbuilt h88, POM plate, and a mill-maxed h88 PCB. The mill-maxed h88 was a defect pcb so the caps lock is off-center. It was gold mill-maxed to use as a tester pcb before soldering anything.

Not FCFS. Preference in favor of bundles and anyone I have traded with previously. Will consider offers as well. Mainly looking to ship in CONUS.

Lastly, I'm looking to pick up a set of either GMK or OG dolch keycaps. Let me know if you have some you'd be willing to let go of :)

Thank you for looking. As always please leave a comment before you PM."

Open to trading for the Cyberdeck colorway (base set only) or just selling for **$200 shipped**. (Slightly high, favoring trade)

\----------------------------------------------------------------

**E-White Clarabelle**

:( Beautiful board still looking for a *loving home*. Brand new Clarabelle southpaw mini 1800 keyboard! Preordered this way back thinking I could live without a number row. I am very very wrong.

Opened to check for any e-white issues. It looks amazing, couple of small nicks on the inside and I tried to take some good pictures of. Comes with carrying case, brass plate, microfiber and two PCB’s. Looking for **$600** shipped in the US.

Open to local sale (San Jose) for **$575**!

|A-Stock GeonWorks F1-8X (WKL Gray) condition: 10/10|\- aluminum leaf spring plate - Fave87 C-type PCB Mill-Maxed with Mill-Max 7305 sockets. The keyboard was assembled by a professional keyboard atelier in Korea. Both the stabilizers and the switches are very well tuned. - NovelKeys Creams lubed with 205 and filmed with 0,15 mm TX films. - Stabilizers were lubed initially with 205 on the housing and wires but it kinda wore off, so I added a fair amount of Dielectric grease to the wires and it removed any rattle. - The Keyboard is insane acoustically, it is poppy and it'll sound insane with any switch Imo, the plate adds flex and brings a soft-typing experience, it's an incredible experience overall. I Received the keyboard, used it for 1 week at most, and left it in the initial GeonWorks Bag ever since. it's in pristine condition. Only selling it with Switches and Stabilisers and it comes with a HotSwap PCB. it also comes with extra bumpons, Geon stickers, extra vitton gasket and screws. *Keycap set not for sale*|~~1050 euros~~ [~~Typing test~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNm3HYBkmwk) SOLD|

Hi mm!

Got these from extra's but after seeing it next to my thermal I was just not feeling it. So that's why I'd like to trade or sell my GMK Nautilus 2 base set and deskmat. It's never been mounted and only opened to check against my board. 

I'm initially trying to trade it/them for the following (hit me up with offers if you want some cash with it):

If you'd really wanna buy them it's €210 for the base kit and €220 if you buy the deskmat as well (deskmat only would be €25). I paid €206 in total for them. Prices are excluding shipping costs.

TypeMachina x TGR Jane v1.5 | WKL Black, Black Aluminum Plate, Brass Plate, 2 PCBs | Couple of minor flaws on the board like you'd expect from use. Please see the pictures for more details. When I received the board, one of the PCBs was missing a transistor (not sure what this it's called?) causing the left alt key to not work. I rerouted it to a different switch hole and it worked fine. The other PCB is desoldered and working fine. Both PCBs will be desoldered before shipping. If you want a brand new PCB, you can also get a compatible [h87a PCB from 1upkeyboards](https://1upkeyboards.com/shop/controllers/hineybush-h87a-tkl-pcb/) | Prefer trades but willing to let it go for $1725. | Available
KBD75V2 | Grey top, dark grey bottom, blue aluminum weight, millmaxed PCB, aluminum plate, Stupidfish case foam, Durock V1 stabs | This is a beater board as it was my first custom keyboard. There's nothing flawless about this board and I did my best to capture all of the imperfection in the photos. The alu plate is also pretty scratched up from using a switch puller. The PCB was millmaxed using 0305 sockets and has regular and stepped capslock compatibility. I have an extra PCB with some sockets that aren't working that I can throw in as well if you wanna tinker around. | I paid $305 to put together this board. Looking to get $175 shipped  | SOLD

My preference is a CONUS sale, but if they sit unsold for long enough, I'll open it up to international as well. The Dolch set is from from a GB years back on GH run by Ivan (before he scammed everyone). There is only a tiny amount of shine on one of the 4 spacebars for Dolch, but there are 4 spacebars! The GMK Soware has had very little use and has no shine at all. This was from Originative years ago. Some very important details about how I want to ship these keycaps is that I have trays as can be seen in the photos. I prefer to ship these keycaps without the tray in a small sturdy box with lots of padding. This allows me to keep the keyset protected and just makes life simpler on me by not having to acquire a large box to fit the tray. I understand for many this is a deal breaker, but for those that are okay with it that is great.

[pics](https://imgur.com/a/PJHBZap)

EDIT: I've gotten some questions about the condition. It's brand new. Never built. Just taken out of the box to take pics for this post. 
Actually, when I opened the box for the first time last week (to take pics for this post) I found out RAMA actually forgot to send me the bottom half of the case. Luckily they sent me a new one without much hassle. I received the bottom case from RAMA on Apr 27. 

Hey everyone, 

I've decided to sell my **RAMA M65-B Rose Tank**. I would like to sell it as a **bundle** with **GMK Olivia++ Dark Base** for **$2600** **shipped** to the US (will not ship outside of US). And I'd realllllyyyyy prefer selling it as bundle with GMK Olivia++ Dark. If there are no takers for the bundle in like a week then I'll repost without the required bundle. Or I guess if I have a buyer for both that’d work too 

Local pickup in the Seattle area will knock $100 off the price.

Rose Tank comes with:

* PVD Brass bottom (Manufacturer error, was supposed to come with KURO base)
* Internal Weight
* Solderable PCB
* Mirror Polished PVD Plate (Brass)
* [Everything else listed on the product page.](https://ramaworks.store/products/m65-b)

It will be shipped with USPS Signature Required service and it will be insured.

hi everyone \~

i built this keyboard a few months ago but i am currently needing to come up with some cash. going to try selling as a ""complete"" because i think this is just such a beautiful board. deserves a good home. photos really don't do  justice... the thing glows.

specs:

\~ e-white KFE CE with purple bottom weights. solder PCB built with lubed Pinoko switches and lubed Durock stabilizers on a polycarbonate plate - it has a really amazing sound. in between a clack and a thock. nice and low typing angle for a more modern keeb experience. bisoromi vibes

\~ includes additional brass weights and a purple aluminum plate which matches the current weights. (monokei also has extra PCBs for sale right now so you could rebuild if desired)

\-GMK Noel keycaps. so nice on e-white board which i have none other than the KFE. this was the endgame build. comes with full base set in original keycap packaging. there is a tear/crack in the packaging but keycaps are like new. no shine. can take some bucks off if you don't want the keycap packaging (will ship in zip bags)

\~ matching light blue tokkipee artisan (currently on the f13 key)

\~ all original KFE CE packaging included

**$1100 shipped** (within the US) takes this board. PM me if you are interested and maybe we can work something out. but as of right now i won't part it out. and no trades at the moment. 

thanks!!"

Hey guys, I am freeing up some space for the new projects

All prices include PayPal fees, invoice only. As usual please comment before DM, no chat.

**Worldwide shipping,** will be calculated on request, please DM for that. For artisans around $10, for GMK set should be around $25. For keyboard it should be $40-50, If a keyboard buyer is in the USA I suggest using a more reliable and quicker service, should be around $80

Please note that mail services are still somewhat unpredictable, so shipping might take a long time. Apologies in advance.

&#x200B;

**1.** **Fully built Percent Studio Canoe Gen1 polycarbonate**

[Detailed pics and condition](https://imgur.com/a/oL0UsZ8)

* Built with an aftermarket PCB and an FR4 plate from [Mechlovin](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/gxtgio/gb_mechlovin_kanu_canoe_v1_compatible_pcb_plates/). Fully tuned H1s (Deskeys films, lubed with 203g2, TX 60g springs lubed with TX oil) and C3 stabs. Used Kester solder.
* PCB has support for VIA and many layouts (split backspace, split spacebar etc, see [their post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/gxtgio/gb_mechlovin_kanu_canoe_v1_compatible_pcb_plates/))
* I did enamel infills for the front and back engravings. Front is yellow (matches GMK Serika perfectly), back is dark gray with a subtle golden pearl (see pictures)

Other Parts (extras):

* Original PCB with Bluetooth, there is a battery lead soldered on with a connector. There are 2 spare batteries as well. Didn't use it with BT, never flashed it.
* Custom cut carbon fiber plate for the original PCB.
* Original Alu plate
* Aluminum weight in black color (purchased separately)
* Original Box and stickers.

Condition:

* I accidentally touched a spot on the back weight (near 0) with a solvent, it's shinier than other surfaces. Noticeable under certain angles, see pictures
* Polycarbonate texture is a little different around infills after wiping, noticeable under certain angles, see pictures.
* Otherwise the case is pretty much perfect, might be light signs of use, but no nicks or scuffs.
* Original PCB: it has been soldered and desoldered once, there is one lifted pad on the backside, fixed with a wire, see pictures.
* Mechloving PCB: built once, never desoldered.

&#x200B;

Only sold as a bundle, except the alu weight — I'll entertain the idea of selling separately, but bundle will take priority.

I can desolder the switches for you (Hakko FR-301) but they will still be a part of the bundle.

Feel free to reach out for more details and/or pictures.

I am selling my GMK Laser R2 in the synthwave set, as well as my KAT Mizu full moon deskmat. Both are in mint condition and have no signs of wear or shine. The GMK set comes with the original packaging and plastic film around it (I just cut a hole so that it can slide in/out) and has been mounted once but only used for about 2 days. The deskmat has been used for under a week.

**Important Note:** For the GMK set, I can not for the life of me find one of the ""enter"" keys. The enter key that is missing is the one that is the same colour as the alphas. **However** I still have the accent key enter (see photo). I am still looking for the missing one, and if I find it I **will** include it upon shipping.

**Reason for selling:** I impulse bought these when I first entered the hobby, but my tastes and setup has changed to where these 2 items no longer match. I am also open to trades (GMK, Epbt, Kat keycaps, or entry level boards).

Hi [u/mechmarket](https://www.reddit.com/u/mechmarket/), How are y'all doing today?

I have some things to get rid of today hoping they'll find the love they deserve elsewhere

I'll favor Eu shipping there, but you can still hit me up via PM maybe we can find an arrangement on a product

Note : GMK WoB Keycap set isn't for sale

| A-Stock GeonWorks F1-8X (WKL Gray) condition: 10/10 | \- aluminum leaf spring plate   \- Fave87 C-type PCB Mill-Maxed with Mill-Max 7305 sockets. The keyboard was assembled by a professional keyboard atelier in Korea. Both the stabilizers and the switches are very well tuned.        - NovelKeys Creams lubed with 205 and filmed with 0,15 mm TX films.                                          - Stabilizers were lubed initially with 205 on the housing and wires but it kinda wore off, so I added a fair amount of Dielectric grease to the wires and it removed any rattle.     \- The Keyboard is insane acoustically, it is poppy and it'll sound insane with any switch Imo, the plate adds flex and brings a soft-typing experience, it's an incredible experience overall. I Received the keyboard, used it for 1 week at most, and left it in the initial GeonWorks Bag ever since. it's in pristine condition. Only selling it with Switches and Stabilisers and it comes with a HotSwap PCB. it also comes with extra bumpons, Geon stickers, extra vitton gasket and screws. *Keycap set not for sale* | 1080 euros [Typing test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNm3HYBkmwk) |

[KFE Round 1 + Extras](https://imgur.com/a/tIS0TCd)| Silver KFE from r1 (weights are located inside case, not on the bottom, and the connection is Mini USB). Currently built on a PC plate with some of the smoothest retooled blacks I've ever used. Comes with an additional unbuilt h88, POM plate, and a mill-maxed h88 PCB. The mill-maxed h88 was a defect pcb so the caps lock is off-center. It was gold mill-maxed to use as a tester pcb before soldering anything. I have a switch that'll make the standard caps key fit but it doesn't solder in. That maxes are soldered for both the ANSI and ISO layouts though. Please pay attention to some minute cosmetic blemishes on the board as seen in the album. Keycaps sold separately. | $860 Shipped|

Some are missing the little clips that snap them to the plate because they were used in hot swap and they snapped off while pulling them out, and some others are close to snapping off. Can be seen in time stamp. Doesn't affect stability.

For the stock tangerines, I bought them apparently lubed from another user on here, but when they arrived they had the factory lube on them, so I relubed some of them."

Good evening all,

&#x200B;

I have a SEALED GMK Red Samurai 65% kit I'm looking to sell.

&#x200B;

I ordered this set and it never arrived, so I asked for a replacement which arrived immediately. This set turned up last week, 4 months late, and I have no use for 2 kits.

&#x200B;

(Because I have a 2nd kit which is opened, if you'd like to see what's inside, I can send a photo of that).

&#x200B;

I am asking for ~~£120~~ £100 + shipping (this covers what I paid including customs, shipping and sealed value). UK buyers preferred, but open to EU.

&#x200B;

Thanks!"

To make it easier for buyers:

\- Shipping prices in eu generally are 4-15 euros (depends on various reasons (if it untracked or tracked), how big is the package)

\- Shipping prices to usa/canada generally are 20-70 (depends on various reasons, mostly size and weight affects price exponentially)

\- PRICE<60 € is UNTRACKED unless +2.5 € for tracked;

\- 60=<PRICE<100 € (or just generally heavy) is UNTRACKED unless +3 € - 3.5 € for tracked (unless listed otherwise)

\- PRICE=>100+ € items is sent via tracked/registered mail unless asked otherwise;

\- Shipping to UK due to new regulations increase by roughly 3e (just add 3e to current EU price).

In the future I may offer lube or sodering services, but I still need 6 (on officialy 4) trades to go :)

The listed items is easily reachable and I can photoshoot them every two weeks. However I have more items (switches, pcbs, keyboard cases), which is too much work to photoshoot (it is really annoying to do that every two weeks), but you can ask me more options and I may list more items.

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-60 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct. You can write to me with a similar price I offer, however if this is not my offering price, there is much lower chance I will sell item right away or at all. Especially if price is fixed
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay, but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, ask :)*"

|Ink PC D65|Been my daily driver since the beginning of the year, loved how it looked with FFFs. Case and weight in immaculate condition. Comes with lubed Durock v2 stabs, hotswap pcb and brass plate (gaskets attached to it). Though later using it I started disliking how stiff it felt due to the unnecessary side gaskets, so I shoddily scraped off them off. End result: still felt stiff but sound did lower in pitch a bit. Will come with Bolsa Supply hard case and extra screws/tool/gaskets.|$370 Shipped / $330 Local|
|~~Yolk RAMA M6-C~~|~~Hotswap RGB PCB. Will come with Yolk grid caps and switch puller. No USB cable. For switches you can choose either: 6 BOX Royals (tactile) that came with the M6, or 6 Unholy Bobas (Halo True housing, Silent U4 Boba Stem) that are currently installed.~~|~~$220 Shipped / $200 Local~~ **SOLD LOCAL FOR ASKING**|

|67x FFF housings w/ UHMWPE Rev. 1 stems (I mistyped in the title and recounted 67 of them)|Made these for the Ink D65, they're great but weird. Most of these feel pleasant to type on, and about a dozen feel slightly heavier than the rest. Found out it's due to inconsistent stem molds, so some will fit fine and bottom out very easily while others will bottom out but the further you press the heavier it becomes, squishing against the housing's slide rails. Lubed with Krytox 205g0, Deskey filmed, and 105 oiled 67g JWK springs. [Here's a butt ugly sound test I made with them on the Ink D65 with all gaskets installed and PBT caps](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CxXpdB_4Iy12fng2msdmTNqGbmkp0v8d/view?usp=sharing)|$60 Shipped / $50 Shipped|
|24x NK Creams + 1 Creamsicle Sample|Stock, leftovers from making Creamsicles. Found a single Tangerine switch laying around so I just lubed it with some 205g0 and 105 spring oil, and filmed it with TX film.  Don't need as I made Creamsicles out of Kiwi housings. And if you plan on just using the Creams as is I can lube them for you if asked:)|$25 Shipped / $20 Local|

This is my first time posting to Mechmarket. I am selling three items that haven't gotten much use lately.

**GMK Oblivion Assembly V2 / Ortholinear / Ergodox ~~($140)~~:** ***Sold!***

This is a like new set of keycaps for ortholinear keyboards. I only used the keycaps for a couple of weeks. I can ship this with or without the box. Shipping without the box will have a small price reduction.

**Keyboardio Atreus w/Case ~~($130)~~**  ***Sold!***

The Atreus has Speed Copper switches. This was one of the first production runs of the Atreus. Works great! I only used it for a month or so and did exchange the switches. As a warning, I did bend a couple of the switch prongs in the process, but everything works fine.

One of the drawbacks of the first run was the keycaps and their labels ""wear"" away rather quickly, or they look dirty. See image of the ""Shift"" keycap.


**Iris V2.1 (~~$10~~)** ***Sold!***

This Iris was the first keyboard I worked on. The soddering isn't great. I went through three pro-micros but the usb connection kept comming off. It has been awhile since I used this keyboard, but everything worked. The pro-micros just need to be replaced. I will also include the cable that connects the two halves.

The switches are Greetech Brown.

I am selling this for the cost of shipping it out."

Hello! Hope you guys are doing well!

I have some ramas up for sale today. All 3 ramas are new and sealed.

I am looking to donate some cash from this sale to a local cat rescuer, can view her instagram at [.@fioloh](https://www.instagram.com/fioloh/?hl=en). She has been helping many stray cats/dogs (mainly cats) find homes, seek medical help (including surgeries) as well as helping to foster. I found her work really meaningful (especially because I like cats). Hence, I'll state 2 prices (just $10 difference), if you would like to help, you can opt to purchase the slightly more expensive price, it's perfectly okay if you don't want to. The donation will be publicly recorded at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asY5BAWSZ_pmxUy2jxmaSa1eHDddTiLQlEhGi1niuyw/edit#gid=1722981492), under tehbingg. (I hope this is allowed by the mods, otherwise please let me know, I'll be willing to remove.) Prior donations from previous sales have been made (can be seen in the spreadsheet).

I can provide more photos of the ramas upon request:)

This would not be FCFS as I would like to prioritize the donation prices to help a little more.

Hey guys, I am freeing up some space for the new projects

All prices include PayPal fees, invoice only. As usual please comment before DM, no chat.

**Worldwide shipping,** will be calculated on request, please DM for that. For artisans around $10, for GMK set should be around $25. For keyboard it should be $40-50, If a keyboard buyer is in the USA I suggest using a more reliable and quicker service, should be around $80

Please note that mail services are still somewhat unpredictable, so shipping might take a long time. Apologies in advance.

&#x200B;

**1.** **Fully built Percent Studio Canoe Gen1 polycarbonate**

[Detailed pics and condition](https://imgur.com/a/oL0UsZ8)

* Built with an aftermarket PCB and an FR4 plate from [Mechlovin](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/gxtgio/gb_mechlovin_kanu_canoe_v1_compatible_pcb_plates/). Fully tuned H1s (Deskeys films, lubed with 203g2, TX 60g springs lubed with TX oil) and C3 stabs. Used Kester solder. 
* PCB has support for VIA and many layouts (split backspace, split spacebar etc, see [their post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/gxtgio/gb_mechlovin_kanu_canoe_v1_compatible_pcb_plates/))
* I did enamel infills for the front and back engravings. Front is yellow (matches GMK Serika perfectly), back is dark gray with a subtle golden pearl (see pictures)

Other Parts (extras): 

* Original PCB with Bluetooth, there is a battery lead soldered on with a connector. There are 2 spare batteries as well. Didn't use it with BT, never flashed it.
* Custom cut carbon fiber plate for the original PCB. 
* Original Alu plate
* Aluminum weight in black color (purchased separately)
* Original Box and stickers. 

Condition: 

* I accidentally touched a spot on the back weight (near 0) with a solvent, it's shinier than other surfaces. Noticeable under certain angles, see pictures
* Polycarbonate texture is a little different around infills after wiping, noticeable under certain angles, see pictures.
* Otherwise the case is pretty much perfect, might be light signs of use, but no nicks or scuffs. 
* Original PCB: it has been soldered and desoldered once, there is one lifted pad on the backside, fixed with a wire, see pictures.
* Mechloving PCB: built once, never desoldered.

&#x200B;

Only sold as a bundle, except the alu weight — I'll entertain the idea of selling separately, but bundle will take priority. 

I can desolder the switches for you (Hakko FR-301) but they will still be a part of the bundle.

Feel free to reach out for more details and/or pictures.

|A-Stock GeonWorks F1-8X (WKL Gray) condition: 10/10|aluminum leaf spring plate Fave87 C-type PCB Mill-Maxed with Mill-Max 7305 sockets. The keyboard was assembled by a professional keyboard atelier in Korea. Both the stabilizers and the switches are very well tuned. I sell it with NovelKeys Creams lubed with 205 and filmed with 0,15 mm TX films. Stabilizers were lubed initially with 205 on the housing and wires but it kinda wore off, so I added a fair amount of Dielectric grease to the wires and it removed any rattle. The Keyboard is insane acoustically, it is poppy and it'll sound insane with any switch Imo, the plate adds flex and brings a soft-typing experience, it's an incredible experience overall. I Received the keyboard, used it for 1 week at most, and left it in the initial GeonWorks Bag ever since. it's in pristine condition. Only selling it with Switches and Stabilisers and it comes with a HotSwap PCB. it also comes with extra bumpons, Geon stickers, extra vitton gasket and screws. *Keycap set not for sale*|1095 euros [Typing test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNm3HYBkmwk)|

Hey y'all, wanted to make a sale post for this Godspeed75 I recently bought from the extras drop on TKC. The front of the board was just too high for my personal liking and am thus looking to sell it off at cost + materials used to build it (or trade). It's built with L+F 62g Tangies (205g0 and 0.15mm TX Films), and the stabs are lubed XHT BDZ. The board is pretty much in perfect condition, the only flaws are small surface scratches on the frosted polycarbonate, which is a common feature of frosted polycarbonate. They practically not visible unless held against very harsh light at a specific angle on the back of the keyboard. One of the screws also doesn't tighten fully for some reason, but unscrews with no problem. It does not affect functionality in any way.

My price breakdown = $460USD for the board + 85USD for the L+F switches + 25USD for the lubed stabs. I am open to negotiating so shoot your shot. Please reply to the post before **private messaging** . I will not reply otherwise, and all chats will be ignored. To avoid any scammers ofc.

I am looking for **$570USD SHIPPED** within Canada/USA. The only trades I am interested in are GMK sets but specifically (in the following order in terms of preference):

1. GMK Olivia ++ Dark Base + hihihi enter + 100USD shipped (I value the two at 270USD + 200USD respectively).
2. GMK Bingsu Base + 220USD shipped (I value the Bingsu base at 350USD)
3. GMK Camping R2 Base + Novelties + 280 USD shipped (I value the two at 290USD)

Thanks for your time :)"

Hi everyone,

[Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/SzjkbXX)

Selling a RAMA Thermal that I purchased on r/mm. Should have trusted my instincts and stuck with at least 65% layouts.

Description:

-Previous owner graded the exterior of the case as 9.5/10 which I would agree with.

-Comes with 3 PCBs: Original solder built with 68g bobagums lubed with Tribosys 2304 and durock v2 stabilizers, a new WT-60A, and a new hotswap pcb. The original solder PCB has an LED issue with the 7 key, but otherwise functions perfectly.

-Comes with 3 plates: Beam plate has some scratches from use but I couldn’t really notice once the keycaps were on. Also comes with a Halt plate that appears to be new and a custom POM plate from Ponoko that has been tested to fit Gateron Ink switches properly.

-Tools pictured for build and RAMA cable also included.

Asking 700 plus shipping for the bundle listed below.

Not FCFS, priority given to local sale in Phila area. Trade interests include unbuilt VEGA or Think6.5 v2, possibly some GMK sets like Bingsu, Ursa, Nautilus Nightmares, Calm Depths.

Only shipping CONUS, please comment before PM, thanks!"

There are small scratches on the weight (pictured in the last photo).  Used for three days and couldn't get used to not having arrow keys.  **Asking $1,100 shipped to the CONUS via Paypal Invoice or $800 for just the board without the keycaps**

Selling my U80-A which I got late 2020. I could not find a single flaw or scratch on the case, and this comes with an additional fresh PCB since the one I receive initially was scuffed but usable (right arrow-key doesn't work).

Kinda over GMK sets honestly, ABS sounds super mediocre and shines. The Polaris blew my socks off so I'm trying to get more boards of that quality or better. 

All prices include shipping to CONUS, and more pictures/details can be provided.  

#Stuff I want to sell 
* ~~~87x BSUN translucent holy pandas. Built with BSUN transparent panda housings, Halo true stems, and 62g springs, and have not been modified in any way outside of that. I can also lube them for a little more.~~ 
**~~$68 OBO or trades for stock linears~~**
* TX 75g 16mm springs. 100x, and they have been lubed with 105 oil. **$10 without tracking**

*** 
#Stuff I want to trade (all GMK sets have been used for a week at most and have no shine)
* GMK Ursa base
* GMK Metaverse R2 base 
* ~~GMK Noel base~~ 
* GMK Olivia++ light and spacebars. Base has never been mounted, only various 2u spacebars have been used. *Hard* trade
* Scuffed PC Uni660. Fully wireless, split, 660 layout in PC, built with 62g L/F Creams. PC is cracked in like 6 places and one of the case screw holes doesn't work, but it sounds excellent with burger mount and the stainless steel weights. 
* Orange alps 60% build. Orange alps have been ultrasonically cleaned, paper modded, spring swapped with 40g Sprit springs (can replace with original springs), and currently in a plastic case w/ foam. Built on a steel plate on a Voyager60 pcb, and flashed with VIA. Comes with a full set of ultrasonically cleaned AEK2 keycaps, as well as a set of M0116 keycaps. Alps are definitely the best tactile I have ever used, but I'm kinda getting over tactiles in general tbh. 
* Ikkakuuju Lola

*** 
#Stuff I want to trade for (PP on either side as required)  
* KAT Milkshake! Looking for Katakana/Weirdo/Normal alphas, Mods, and Specialties. OR Specialties on its own. 
* High end boards! Not looking for anything in particular, my only requirement is that it's 60-65 form factor, not really interested in anything bigger or smaller. Stuff like 512, Moontower, Vega, Constellation, Polaris PC, etc, and I'd happily n:1 for nice boards"

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-60 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct. You can write to me with a similar price I offer, however if this is not my offering price, there is much lower chance I will sell item right away or at all. Especially if price is fixed
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay, but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, ask :)*"

Will ship in their original labeled bags.~~ **Sold for $150**

Since it's been so long, I'm not sure what the names of these GID bots are. Also, since these caps are one of the first caps that Bro made before using the ID system, they don't come with ID cards. As far as I can guess, these are what I think the caps are from photos online and what caps I can remember I collected.

I'd prefer to sell this locally/for pickup in the Bay Area, zip code 95014. Otherwise, buyer is responsible for fees and shipping. So this was my dream board when I was still into caps, but immediately after building it, I realized it wasn't this super awesome experience I was hoping for. Not saying that the board isn't great. Rama makes a lot of high quality items. Maybe it's the switches or whatever the case may be, I just don't have the time to look into how I could perfect it.

Extra details (if you're curious):

I fell in love with polycarbonate in the \~8months of delay on the M60, so I'm putting it up for sale for someone who will love beautiful brass and hihihi. It’s hotswap.

PnC is a great set that I doubt will ever run again (it's now transitioned to lite), just not what we were promised. So this is a great item for someone who now KNOWS what they're getting into.

The cable is USB-C to USB-C made by me. I matched the colors pretty darn well to PnC from the renders, so it would be perfect for PnC lite. I tested it upon making it and have not used it since.

The holy pandas I lubed with 3203 very lightly on the sides of the stems/housings. The springs were ping-y so I used 205g0 on them lightly with a paintbrush. Slight tactility decrease but huge improvement in sound, and the transition into the bump is seamless. Just trying to recoup costs because \~it turns out I don't like tactiles\~ and these were $1 per switch in GB.

TKC Finale Deskmat: brand new, got it for GMK Dracula. GMK Dracula is still AWOL, and I have too many deskmats.

Hi everyone!

For sale is my all-silver FLX Virgo, built with FR4 Plate and (self-) lubed and filmed Holy Pandas. It comes in the original box with an aluminium plate and some spare hardware that came with it. Stabilizers are gold plated (can't remember the brand, but they were pretty expensive).

It is in very good condition, no scratches or any other damages. The one thing that you should know is that all Virgos came with unprotected brass weights, which get a patina over time even when taken care of very well. I personally even like that, but not everyone does so keep that in mind. 

Price: 1600€ (excl. shipping)

The OG Cherry Keycaps +  GMK OG Spacebars are not included, but I'd be willing to sell it along with the board if there's interest."

|Think6.5 V1 Frosted Poly Hotswap|Has GMK retooled stabs (may want to swap or retune, not my best job). Flashed with VIA. Used pretty lightly for a few months. Includes regular brass badge and polycarbonate badge (from giveaway). One thing to note is that the PCB USB-C connection isn't perfect. Moving the board will sometimes lead to the board reconnecting, which can be of an annoyance.  [Sound test with inks](https://soundcloud.com/junhyukee/think65-gateron-inks)|$520 shipped OBO|
|HHKB Pro 2|Has Hasu Controller, Stock 45g domes, Stock blank caps, lubed with 3204, Deskeys #3 silencing rings + 1 x-ring due to running out, lined with sorbothane.  Does not include stock controller. Also comes with the stock non-accent esc/ctrl keys. One of my favorite boards, but unfortunately it hasn't been used recently. Added bump-ons, has 3d printed usb port covers. One note, some of the screw housings for the pcb screws have been stripped (3-4). The screws go in, but don't tighten all the way. This doesn't affect the experience, but the board isn't perfect! [Sound test](https://soundcloud.com/junhyukee/hhkb)|$220 shipped OBO|
|Leopold FC660C|Hasu controller, stock domes, stock caps (aside from the 2 artisans), silence-x rings. One of the screws was stripped when I was modding it, so there are some scuffs on the pcb(?). Was my work board, but haven't used it in over a year due to the pandemic. Does not come with any of the missing keycaps, or original accessories (what you see is what you get)|$220 shipped OBO|
|Topre Domes (stock HHKB)|Had an extra set just in case I lost any, but since I'm offloading my topre boards, no more need for these!|$25 shipped OBO|

The KBD67MKII V2 Black PC Hotswap Bundle is perfect for anyone who wants a good quality entry level keyboard. Comes with the hotswap PCB and 3 different types of plates (the FR4 and POM plate don't have standoffs, which is totally fine). Although it is pricier than other entry level keyboards like the NK65ee or the KBD67Lite, the quality of this keyboard is far superior to the 2 keyboards. I am selling this bundled with GMK Cafe base, and will be shipped in the KBD67Lite carrying case and coiled cable. It's pretty much everything you need to build a keyboard :)

All prices include shipping (priced based on the market); not splitting bundle! Comment before PM please (no chats). Thanks!

|A-Stock GeonWorks F1-8X (WKL Gray)                              condition: 9,5/10|Plate : aluminum leaf spring  PCB: Fave87 C-type Mill-Maxed with Mill-Max 7305 sockets. The keyboard was assembled by a professional keyboard atelier in Korea. Both the stabilizers and the switches are very well tuned.                             I sell it with NovelKeys Creams lubed with 205 and filmed with 0,15 mm TX films. Stabilizers were lubed initially with 205 on the housing and wires but it kinda wore off, so I added a fair amount of Dielectric grease to the wires and it removed any rattle. The Keyboard is insane acoustically, it is poppy and it'll sound insane with any switch Imo, the plate adds flex and brings a soft-typing experience, it's an incredible experience. I Received the keyboard, used it for 1 week at most, and left it in the initial GeonWorks Bag ever since. it's in pristine condition. Only selling it with Switches and Stabilisers and it comes with a HotSwap PCB. it also comes with extra bumpons, Geon stickers, extra vitton gasket and screws. *Keycap set not for sale*|1150 euros ; [Typing test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNm3HYBkmwk)|

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-60 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct. You can write to me with a similar price I offer, however if this is not my offering price, there is much lower chance I will sell item right away or at all. Especially if price is fixed
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay, but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, ask :)*"

TypeMachina x TGR Jane v1.5 WKL Black, Black Aluminum Plate, Brass Plate, 2 PCBs | Used for about a month or two and decided the sound signature isn't for me. There are two scuffs on the inside of the case. One of the scuffs affects the exterior and shows in-between the two halves of the case on the right side of the board. When I received the board, one of the PCBs was missing a transistor(not sure what this it's called?) causing the left alt key to not work. I rerouted it to a different switch hole and it worked fine. PCBs will be desoldered before shipping.

Hello, I am looking to sell a Tofu Acrylic with kiwi switches and a GMK Laser R2 Cyberdeck. The tofu acrylic was my first ever keeb build and I am looking to sell it off to make some more space for my future salvation keyboard to replace it. I have listed the specs of my keeb below. As for the GMK cyberdeck, it just took a bit longer than I thought to get to me and I no longer need it.

~~Tofu Keyboard: $150 Shipped~~ **(SOLD FOR $150)**

GMK Laser Cyberdeck R2: **$170 Shipped**

Keyboard Specs:

* Tofu 60% Acrylic case
* Cannonkeys Instant60 Hotswap PCB
* C3 Kiwi Switches w/ Tribosys 3203 and TX Films
* Durock stabilizers w/ Krytox 205G0 and Dielectric Grease
* Carbon Fiber Plate
* Keycaps not included!

Oh and if you can somehow prove that you're new to keyboards I can take like 10 bucks off of the SA caps, or if it's yer first aritsan I can take 10 bucks off of that too, please be honest though... I'm just gonna trust you guys.

[Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/SzjkbXX)

Selling a RAMA Thermal that I purchased on r/mm. Should have trusted my instincts and stuck with at least 65% layouts.

Description:

-Previous owner graded the exterior of the case as 9.5/10 which I would agree with.

-Comes with 3 PCBs: Original solder built with 68g bobagums lubed with Tribosys 2304 and durock v2 stabilizers, a new WT-60A, and a new hotswap pcb. The original solder PCB has an LED issue with the 7 key, but otherwise functions perfectly.

-Comes with 3 plates: Beam plate has some scratches from use but I couldn’t really notice once the keycaps were on. Also comes with a Halt plate that appears to be new and a custom POM plate from Ponoko that has been tested to fit Gateron Ink switches properly.

-Tools pictured for build and RAMA cable also included.

Asking 700 plus shipping for the bundle listed below.

Not FCFS, priority given to local sale in Phila area. Trade interests include unbuilt VEGA or Think6.5 v2, possibly some GMK sets like Bingsu, Ursa, Nautilus Nightmares, Calm Depths.

Only shipping CONUS, please comment before PM, thanks!"

Timestamp: [https://imgur.com/a/QAWuj9R](https://imgur.com/a/QAWuj9R)

Hey, MM

Today I am selling my barely used drop alt high profile with GMK Laser and a matching aviator cable. I thought I would use this keyboard more than I did and for the past couple of months, it has just been sitting on a shelf. My priority will be the bundle with the keyboard and the cable. I would also rather sell the keyboard as a whole piece, ie. not selling just the keycaps or something. But I am open to offers on just the keyboard, or just keycaps. 

The keyboard is a Drop Alt High Profile in black, with Stupidfish1 case and plate foam, lubed GMK plate mount stabs, Glorious Pandas that are lubed with Krytox 205g0 and filmed with Deskeys films, and of course the holy keycap set GMK Laser with little to no shine. I am looking to get **$325** for the full keyboard but I am open to offers.

I am also selling a matching aviator cable that matches the GMK Laser set. I am looking to get **$70** for this but it can be a bundle with the Drop Alt for $**350**

Feel free to pm me with your offers, questions, and let me know if this price is too high because I have been out of touch with the community for a bit. Thanks for reading!

~~Welcome to my post! I will warn you, a lot of this stuff is pretty dusty, as it was sitting in boxes on my shelves for weeks/months. Especially the cases. Anyway, lets begin.~~

~~Hi! I'm hoping to maybe keep a lot of this as a kit, but willing to separate it. The tofu65 is a little scuffed up, however if you plan to use this build with a hot swap PCB, it's really pointless to try to fix it. I tried my hardest to avoid scraping it up while taking switches out, but it didn't help. The top is just super close to the switches for some reason, so I couldn't avoid it :(There are also a few light scuffs on the bottom, but they aren't nearly as bad as the top. With caps, you don't notice any scuffs.~~

# Tofu65 Kit:

Hi all - looking to sell this XDA Godspeed set. I bought this from another user on here and I just couldn’t get used to the profile. Mounted once, super light use from me, not sure about previous owner. I cleaned only the keys I mounted as best as I could, which were the alphas, Milky Way, and 2 mitonauts. I’d prefer to sell it as a bundle. 

**Prices include shipping and PayPal fee. Please let me know if anything looks unfair.**

**BUNDLE | $150 ($140 local pickup 17601)**

**Includes: Solar Alphas, Apollo Base Icons, Apollo Milky Way, Mitonauts**

I’m also open to trades; some GMK/ePBT sets I’m looking for are Bento, Ramen Shop, Laser, Metropolis (I know R2 is running but I’m impatient), Kon Momo, and Olivia light. Light use/shine ok. Some boards I’m looking for could be any entry level 60% or 65% PC/alum hotswap. I can always pay the difference.

Please comment then PM. Thank you for looking and have a great day!"

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-60 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct. You can write to me with a similar price I offer, however if this is not my offering price, there is much lower chance I will sell item right away or at all. Especially if price is fixed
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay, but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, ask :)*"

Sup Kings and Queens, 

I have a couple of things sitting at home that deserve better than me. Turns out, I keep going back to my Polaris time and again. 

~~**Blurple Voice65 - $650**~~ **SOLD FOR $635**
> ~~*Solder version. NOT HOTSWAP. Built with nicely lubed Vint MX Blacks bought here from another user, with dampeners and all installed, and some excellent stab work if I do say so myself. I think the board feels great as is, but with a bit more break-in, its probably a top lad in the making. Normally I'd offer to desolder the thing if you really wanted but realistically I just straight up do not have the time pls forgive. Comes with extra solder PCB, and alu plate. Comes with original box and stuff ofc. There is a tiny nick on the left edge towards the bottom. Pic included.*~~


~~**GMK Olivia++ Light Base - $310**~~ **SOLD FOR ASKING**

> ~~*I put them on a board for like a week and realized it wasn't really a good match. Not really any significant signs of use or shine. Comes in original box. I mean, its Olivia, what more can I type?*~~

A couple of notes:

Sale is **not FCFS.** I like to sell to people who have some rep or are nice to talk to. Prices are inclusive of shipping via UPS (to US only) and PayPal G&S fees. I'm open to reasonable offers. I'll ship the items once everything is sold.

Not really looking for trades unless you're getting rid of a nice Alpinist or Max Bill Auto. But really, money is better. 

As always, please leave a pm here before messaging me, I'll get back to you as fast as I can. 

Thanks luv."

TypeMachina x TGR Jane v1.5 WKL Black, Black Aluminum Plate, Brass Plate, 2 PCBs | Used for about a month or two and decided the sound signature isn't for me. There are two scuffs on the inside of the case. One of the scuffs affects the exterior and shows in-between the two halves of the case on the right side of the board. When I received the board, one of the PCBs was missing a transistor(not sure what this it's called?) causing the left alt key to not work. I rerouted it to a different switch hole and it worked fine. PCBs will be desoldered before shipping.

GMK Darling + Novelties - The Keycaps Have never been mounted or used, I only took off the wrapping to look at them, and the seal is still on for the novelties. - Price $350 + shipping -Sold

GMK Olivia ++ Light - Used these keycaps for 2 months. I have not seen any shining on them, they still look as good to me as the day I got them. - Price $210 + shipping -Sold

GMK Bleach - Never used and still sealed - Price $200 + shipping -Sold

NK65 Milkshake Edition - Used for two weeks. In good condition, nothing wrong with it, I just decided that the board did not go well with my pc setup theme. - Price - $190 + shipping -Sold

NK65 Smoked + alpaca switches - Used for two months and still in very good condition. I lubed alpaca switches with Kytox 205g0 and also filmed them with deskey film. I also lubed the plate mount stablizers with Kytox 205g0 and bandaid mod it. - Price - $160 + shipping -Sold

KBDPad MKII + Kuro Shiro Numpad Keycaps + Black Inks - Basically brand new condition. Bought this a while ago and can't really remember when I got it. I literally only ever used it once before and besides that it has been sitting on my bookshelf.  The black inks switches and stabilizers have both been lubed with Kytox 205g0. - Price - $120 + shipping - Sold"

1. ~~Alpine 65 in navy blue with brass plate -~~ **~~$600~~** *Sold for 570*

~~BNIB and never built. If you need some stabs to go with it, let me know and we can work something out since I have some on hand~~.

&#x200B;

2.  ~~GMK Camping R2 Base + novelties -~~ **~~$350~~** ~~(not splitting)~~ *Sold for asking*

~~never mounted and never used, novelties are still sealed but the base set has been opened for picture purposes, selling for slightly less than I purchased for on the aftermarket.~~

Both Planck and MT3 set have been used for a total of a day or two. Just can't get the hang of 40% ortho, so I'm going to stick with my Preonic for now.

**Planck: $150 + shipping (from Canada)**  
**MT3 Black on White Ortho: $50 + shipping (from Canada)**

Buy together and I'll pay for shipping within Canada or CONUS (caps won't ship in original box, but Planck will).

In terms of trades, I'm interested in neutral/dark cherry profile sets: ePBT, GMK, etc. White on black, ePBT Heavy Industry, ePBT Grayscale are a few sets I would consider for trade.

Cheers."

I can ship it only on Monday, **so it's not fcfs**, but at the end of the Weekend I'm gonna (most probably) just take the best offer. I am not going below 400e (which still includes shipping) because I need money for something else and I wouldn't sell it otherwise.

set is NOT used at all, it is just opened. Deskmat was used for a week and it has no signs of use.

EU only!

Some folks from US and Australia asked me to sell, and so far the answer is no just because of shipping costs and wait time.

Only selling the whole set right now."

considered gmk japanese modern desko? why wait for gmk when you can have the original today!

wtt Realforce 87u 55g (lubed with 205g0, silenced with deskeys #3) including jis hiragana caps, ATOK cluster and the impossible to find RGB topre cluster. Includes a second red Ctrl key for 86u compatibility, plus the uncoloured mod keys. Can even throw in some novatouch sliders for artisan accents. 

I can also mod them with deskeys domes if preferred, just let me know which ones you want I have access to them all.

wttf interesting mx 60%/Alice/TKL offers (I like polycarb if that helps). Prefer a 1:1 trade or top up on your end, worst I can say is no. I've got the board valued at $500usd, since plenty have asked. 

You won't see these caps again I promise you that, took a lot of time and money to get these bad boys!

Timestamp: [https://imgur.com/a/QAWuj9R](https://imgur.com/a/QAWuj9R)

Hey, MM

Today I am selling my barely used drop alt high profile with GMK Laser and a matching aviator cable. I thought I would use this keyboard more than I did and for the past couple of months, it has just been sitting on a shelf. My priority will be the bundle with the keyboard and the cable. I would also rather sell the keyboard as a whole piece, ie. not selling just the keycaps or something. 

The keyboard is a Drop Alt High Profile in black, with Stupidfish1 case and plate foam, lubed GMK plate mount stabs, Glorious Pandas that are lubed with Krytox 205g0 and filmed with Deskeys films, and of course the holy keycap set GMK Laser with little to no shine. I am looking to get **$325** for the full keyboard but I am open to offers.

I am also selling a matching aviator cable that matches the GMK Laser set. I am looking to get **$70** for this but it can be a bundle with the Drop Alt for $**350**

Feel free to pm me with your offers, questions, and let me know if this price is too high because I have been out of touch with the community for a bit. Thanks for reading!

Please comment before you pm :)"

I am once again asking you to purchase my things. Went a little crazier than usual the past month and realizing I don't have space for everything I bought and also have a financial situation which needs attending to.**>>> Not FCFS! <<<** *Preference goes local bundle > shipped bundle > local > shipped. Highly prefer bundles. Local to Los Angeles, 90006.* Prices local are for pickup, may charge a few bucks of gas for distant meetups. Please PM me if you have any questions.

*I forgot to take the Hyperglides off the table before I took the timestamp but they're not for sale, sorry about that.*

*Also, still looking for CRP Arabic with WKL kit. Yes, I do not have money to spend. Yes, I still want Arabic any way. Can't buy it without the WKL kit though.*

Norbatouch | $650 local, $700 shipped | Bought off [this nice person](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/mkwoc1/cabc_h_cm_novatouch_norbatouch_case_gmk/). Novatouch with KBDfans Silence X rings, Super Lube blend on stems and housing in anodized tactical black Norbatouch. I've always wanted to try a Norbatouch and it didn't disappoint but I don't have the space for this and can't justify keeping it. Selling for what I paid for it. Will come with all original packaging, accessories, plastic Novatouch case, and stock Novatouch keycaps. In like new condition but can provide additional photos upon request. **Add Susuwatari for $100.**
Klippe | $265 local, $295 shipped | Bought off [this nice person](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/mkyghi/usmah_klippe_t_r4_pc_ewhite_tray_mount_pcbs/). PC Klippe T R4 from 1upkeyboards with Instant60 Tsangan and Noxary 5mm PC plate. Additional photos of [machining marks and scuffs on Klippe here](https://imgur.com/a/ksBFmTn) and [Noxary plate here](https://imgur.com/a/0aO6JYr). Meant as a display piece but don't have space for it and also not really into WK 60% any more. Price is for case, PCB, and plate bundled. Will part out if buyers are found for all three items.
GMK Oblivion | ~~$250 local, $275 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Git base, purchased like new from somebody else on here. [Additional photos here.](https://imgur.com/a/6kdpJD3) Little to no shine all over, mounted for 2-3 months but no longer into GMK. Will ship in JTK trays.
GMK White on Black | ~~$90 local, $100 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Bought this locally off someone bundled with another board I bought. Unsure of what round this is but it's pretty shiny. Good beater or backup set more than anything.
MT3 Susuwatari | $100 local, $115 shipped | Base kit, purchased like new from someone else here to go on the Norbatouch but no longer needed since I'm departing with the Norba any way. **Priority goes to the person buying the Norbatouch.**
Salvun ICU keycap | $70 local or shipped | Bought this to go with GMK WoB but no longer needed since I'm selling.
90x Everglide Water Kings | ~~$50 local, $55 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Stock. Have not been mounted except for three which were mounted in a hotswap board to test feel. Selling for what I paid for them.
70x FFFs | $45 local, $55 shipped | Lubed with 205g0, 18x are filmed Deskey films but I received them mixed and so I'm unsure which ones are fimed.
Laser aviator cable | ~~$35 local, $45 shipped~~ **Sold!** | **The one with the blue heatshrinks.** Bought to go with ePBT Sushi and I thought it went really well together since it has blue connectors and is a lighter shade than other Laser-themed cables.
Laser YC-8 cable | ~~$45 local, $55 shipped~~ **Sold!** | **The one with the purple heatshrinks.** Bought from u/ThePrinkus, one of the nicer cables I've had the pleasure of trying. I paired this with the Laser R1 set and this shade works really well but just going another direction.
C3 translucent pink stabilizers | ~~$10 local or add-on shipped~~ **Sold!** | Thought I sold these in a previous post but found them hiding underneath some other stuff. Never used. Comes with 3 2u wires, 1 6.25u wire, **no 7u wire**, housings, screws, and washers.
KBParadise MX V80 keycaps | **Free local pickup, free shipped in bundle** | [These ones.](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=2141) I bought these a *loooooooong* time ago when I was first getting into the hobby several years ago and they got lost in my parents' garage.

I ordered these back in September 2020 hoping they would actually honor their lead time.. 5 months later than advertised, here I am selling off the set since by now I already received GMK sets, which I ordered shortly before or bought off of here...

Anyway, I’m selling all three sets as a bundle.

160 EUR shipped to the EU
UK is more expensive to ship to (15 euros more with DHL)

Yes, kbdfans restocked this set. No, kbdfans did not sell this set cheaper than I priced it at (due to tax and handling fees) and it is out of stock now already anyway.

I'm not looking to flip this set, I just got on the Laser hype train and then regretted it. Therefore, I'm looking to let the set go for £100 + £25 for the import fees I had to pay + shipping. It's not the ideal price as I'd have liked to sell at base price, but I would hate myself if I sold this set to a flipper so it's a partial anti-flip deterrent as well as partially for waiting an entire year for the set to come.

I know there's nothing I can do about it but if you do get this set from me, please don't flip it and use it well. I just want to do my part for the community!

I'm one of the (apparently many) people that was disappointed that this kit turned out more Orange Creamscicle than pastel peaches, so I've never touched the keys, they're BNIB (just took off the shrinkwrap to look at the keys, and then put it away :/)

In light of the designer running this kit a second time with (hopefully) lighter colors, I'm posting this at **$200 shipped** (via USPS) for those that want Peaches n Cream right now and/or like the more saturated tones of the OG version.

Hi!

Have a couple things today that I'd either like to ~~trade for a~~ **~~Singa Unikorn r2.1~~** ~~in~~ **~~E-White~~**~~, or~~ sell. Only looking to ship within CONUS currently. Please see below:

&#x200B;

**~~Geonworks F1-8X (Early Production Anodization) in Navy/Blue-Grey:~~**

* ~~Excellent condition with no scratches, dings, or signs of wear whatsoever. This board was actually commissioned by the owner I bought it from and was built in Korea by KeyDot Keyboard Custom Factory. This is the exact board featured in this~~ [~~sound test~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lzCN8pfaE8)~~.~~
* ~~Built on the stock aluminum leaf spring plate with Cherry Retooled Blacks, lubed with 205g0, spring swapped with 60g TX springs and filmed with TX switch films.~~
   * ~~Can desolder the build (w/ Hakko FR301) as well if you'd prefer~~
* ~~Will include original semi-rigid carrying case, dust bag, and all other accessories (extra feet, extra Viton gasket)~~
* ~~I LOVE this board but I actually got another one in, in WKL configuration. I mention that this is an ""early production anodization"" and you can really see the difference~~ [~~here~~](https://imgur.com/a/lYfBKkf) ~~when compared to my newer, later-production run unit. The color looks deeper and richer on the early ano and is softer to the touch, if that makes sense. It's really nice - but again, WKL came along haha.~~
* ~~The keycaps pictured are for visual purposes only, not included~~

>**~~Trade toward a Singa Unikorn r2.1 in E-White~~** ~~(packaged with Vega) or~~ **~~$1000 shipped OBO.~~** ~~Open to offers.~~ **SOLD**

&#x200B;

**~~ai03 Vega in E-White:~~**

* ~~Excellent condition with no scratches, dings, or signs of wear. Was built by me with love and handled with care during light use.~~
* ~~Currently solder-built on a polycarbonate plate with Vintage Cherry Blacks (from 1992, I believe?) lubed with 205g0 and 105 on the springs. Filmed with resized Thicc Films and spring swapped with 67g TX springs. Durock v2 stabs lubed with 205g0 on the housings and Shin-Etsu grease on the wires (little-known method but very effective!). Plate foam installed.~~
* ~~Will also include 2~~ **~~brand new, unused~~** ~~plates (1 aluminum solder and 1 polycarb hotswap) as well as 2~~ **~~brand new, unused~~** ~~PCBs (1 solder and 1 hotswap). Extra gaskets too.~~
* ~~Original box, accessories and case foam.~~
* ~~The keycaps pictured are for visual purposes only, not included~~

>**~~Trade toward a Singa Unikorn r2.1 in E-White ONLY~~** ~~(packaged with F1-8X)~~**~~.~~** ~~Not for sale at the moment.~~ **NO LONGER AVAILABLE** (since the F1-8X sold on its own)

&#x200B;

**~~MiTo GMK Laser r2 - Base kit and Novelties:~~**

* ~~Both brand new in box and sealed~~
* ~~Yes, Drop will release extras sometime soon, no need to comment.~~

>**~~$340 OBO shipped for both kits~~**~~, not splitting currently.~~ SOLD

MISSING 6.25u SPACE BAR, IT WILL ONLY COME WITH THE WHITE 7u SPACE BAR. I melted the 6.25 trying my hand at fixing the warpage. I can include it if you'd like to try to fix but it is unusable in its current state and I dont think it will ever look normal again. The rest of the set looks good and has been used for about 3 months on and off.

668,/r/mechmarket/comments/mnmud9/ustnhtgr_910_ce_wpaypal/,1617990973.0,[US-TN][H]TGR 910 CE [W]Paypal,"Up for your consideration today is my [910 CE](https://i.imgur.com/d0U2Nob.jpg)

Built with 62g stickered RRE blacks, lubed with 3204 and victorinox oil on springs. Clipped/lubed/bandaided GMK screw in stabs.  The board is currently built with a POM plate, but I have the original brass plate as well as an extra purple top half. Board has the RGB kit and acrylic diffuser installed, but the diffuser was never actually used, it's been in the box since I got the board but installed it for safer shipping.

The board also has 910 inserts made by me installed on both tops.  The gray top has a [trans pink](https://i.imgur.com/hWl6RDZ.jpg) insert, and the purple top has a whitish insert that will shine through whatever color the led behind it is set to, but also [glows green](https://i.imgur.com/lo89jZy.mp4) when the backlight is turned off or if charged with a light.  I can remove these if desired, they're press fit and fairly difficult to install/remove.

If you're unfamiliar with RRE blacks, they're vintage clones from the early 90s.  I believe the housings and stems to be all POM, but could be incorrect on that as there isn't much info on them.  All I know is that they're my favorite linear switch I've used.  I've got two leftover switches from the donor board that I'll include as well in case anything gets funky with any on the board, but all have been working perfectly for the past 3 years since I originally built it.  The POM switch and plate combo is wonderful.

As for defects on the board:

\-[there is a small scuff](https://i.imgur.com/aeqFxsv.jpg) from manufacturing on the bottom of the board to the right of the hole in this photo.  It's very hard to capture in photos, and is only visible at certain angles/lighting.  It looks like 3-4 little dots/streaks.

\-[a streak on the right side of the purple top from manufacturing](https://i.imgur.com/lBPzYnL.jpg)

\-[a smol dot on the front face of the gray top](https://i.imgur.com/gh2Rl7L.jpg)(look directly under the shift key to see it)

\-[some tarnish on the weight](https://i.imgur.com/ydbvOGt.jpg) as well as a small checkmark shaped scratch top-center of the weight.

\-[some tarnish on the plate](https://i.imgur.com/pHp5HTh.jpg)

\-[led burns inside the case](https://i.imgur.com/b4tBRoL.jpg) from the underglow

\-Purple Top

Comes with hotswap PCB, FR4 Plate, Brass Plate, Plate Foam, Case Foam and 5 lubed Smokey Durock V2 stabs. 

Small issue with weight screw holes, but doesn't affect use. It's up on KBDfans rn, but price is basically KBDfans pricing + 40 for the lubed durock v2s and the extra fr4 plate with cheaper shipping. Should be a decent deal I guess.

Custom steel 68-key keyboard. One-off 1.5mm steel plates, Millmaxed with 0305, socketed Elite-C, lubed/clipped plate-mount stabs, PCB foam per key. This thing is solid and feels like a tank, but still has a tiny flex when you type on it, due to where the rubber feet are located. I've used this board to test switches, so there are some scuffs on the steel where the switches sit, but they are not visible when being used. There is a 1m USB-C cable plugged into the Elite-C that is used to plug it in.

Get that roomy 68-key feel without waiting for an Ikki68.

This board has excellent base kit compatibility with keycap sets.

The cost to build was $207 without shipping, $260 with shipping:

- plates. 121 (20 ship)
- PCB. 15 (10 ship)
- diodes. 3.
- elite-c. 18 (4 ship)
- millmax 0305. 14 (8 ship)
- stabs. 25 (11 ship)
- standoffs. 7
- steel screws. 4

I'm asking for $200 plus shipping. Prefer CONUS because of the weight.

Please comment before PM. Chats not accepted. 

Keycaps or switches are not included, but I could be convinced to sell the GMK Coral set with it. PM me your offers.

Corne Cherry v3.0.1 with fr4 top/bottom plates. Translucent Black Oled covers, Blue Oleds, RGB Leds. Two non-socketed standard promicros. TRRS Cable.  

These cornes have a problem with the promicro that affects the master/slave recognition.  
 * The **slave half won't work with the default firmware** but will work compiling the firmware with `#define SPLIT_USB_DETECT`.  
 * The slave will have a small delay of a second or so to boot when plugged.  

So if you already know or want to deal with a custom QMK firmware (like many people do with these boards) it becomes a fully functional keeb.

INTEREST CHECK for more niche items to be sold soon, but now I am NOT SELLING THESE. Write ""Interest in x, please add timestamp and provide the price in the post"", I will provide that and be selling that item for 2 weeks.

* XD60 XD64 3.0 PCB (desoldered) (comp with alps and mx switches);
* 60x Gateron OG tangies (desoldered);

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered to PM. For those who are new here on reddit, ***PM*** is more like email conversation, when chat is like messenger conversation.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-60 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct. You can write to me with a similar price I offer, however if this is not my offering price, there is much lower chance I will sell item right away or at all. Especially if price is fixed
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay, but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, ask :)*"

Hey Y’all,
      I am looking to sell some stuff because I need to buy new tires for the car. I have a violet volt 80 with lubed c3 switches, the Bluetooth battery, foam that came from percent studios, and gazzew boba 62g U4T’s (they are stock sorry). The board is Bluetooth and hot swap. The only thing missing is the badge that goes next to the spacebar. I have a base kit of GMK Metaverse. Mounted only once but didn’t like how it looked on my mode 80 celestial. And finally I have seventy creamsicle clones that I call “Key Limes”. I’ve had creamsicles before and these are basically the same in noise and feel. They were lubed with Krytox 205g0, spring oiled with 105, replaced with Durock 63.5 springs and filmed with deskey films. The housing is just the c3 kiwis which are essentially the same as tangerine (to the best of my knowledge) with nk cream stem. Mounted on a hotswap tester once to get a feel for how they sound. 
Looking to sell for the prices listed below, or OBO. I will take priority over bundled offers. Please write “PM” before you message.

Selling off a lot of my hoarded clacking gear since I've since found my endgame in the *Natec Roach* rubber dome.

Just kiddin', I have two HHKB Pro JP (one of which is Type-S), and those're the only two keyboards I use. In fact, every single item I'm selling today has been UNUSED, and is in NEW condition. Granted, some items have briefly left their box for taking pictures, but nothing I'm offering here has been touched for more than a minute or two (apart of course from time spent assembling in the Preonic's case).

Following are timestamps of the individual items along with my asking price and a short description for each of them.



First off, ***KEYBOARDS and KEY CAP SET***:

KBParadise V60 Type R with Cherry MX Clear switches | new, unused, in original packaging | Only taken out of its box to check if the LEDs were all working properly, and to take a picture. This is the limited edition version of the regular KBParadise V60, that has LEDs at the switches, as well as on the sides of the keyboard. Check out this video for a showcase of it in full glory [here](https://youtu.be/MclO0cLKOj4?t=427). | [timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/DJFXVQI) | €150 (does not include shipping cost)
~~Drop + OLKB Preonic Keyboard MX Kit Rev 3 (latest)~~ | ~~pre-assembled, new, unused~~ | ~~This keyboard has not been used after assembly. Anodized orange CNC-aluminum case. It has been installed with Bronze (clicky) Kaihua Kailh Speed Switches. I can optionally throw in a set of Cherry MX Blue switches that can be popped into the board without soldering, as the Preonic has a hot-swap PCB.~~ | ~~[timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/uuMnAyC)~~ | ~~€190 (does not include shipping cost)~~ sold!

Happy belated Easter and passover, friends.

I've made several bad -- or good, depending on how you look at it -- decisions on the market the past few weeks and it's once again time to let go of some stuff I'm not using. **>>> Not FCFS! <<<** *Preference goes local bundle > shipped bundle > local > shipped. Local to Los Angeles, 90006.* Prices local are for pickup, may charge a few bucks of gas for distant meetups. Please PM me if you have any questions. Comment before PM, chats are disabled. Thanks for reading, have a great rest of your week!

**Looking for CRP Arabic. Willing to trade or buy straight up. Please include timestamps if you send me an offer. Thanks!**

Item | Price | Notes

Polaris | $700 shipped, $650 local | HHKB layout Polaris in black, built with 67g Tangies (205g0, Deskey films) and orange C3 stabs (V1, 205g0, dieletric) on brass with case and plate foam. Bought local already built by previous owner, I have not opened the board up myself. Great board, one of my favorites I've ever owned, but I'm back on TKL for good. Will come with one desoldered PCB, [Hype's full FR4 plate](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/lyhwmq/bulk_fr4_plates_for_vega_thinkv2_space65_d65/), another full FR4 plate, one POM WKL plate cut by [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/), and 24x gaskets from u/ThePanduuh. More information on the gaskets can be found in [their original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/mir2lq/uspah_artisans_brutal60_switches_polaris/). **Only splitting board and extras if buyers are found for everything. Priority goes to buyer with extras. GMK Oblivion (git base) not included but open to bundling.**
D60 | ~~$325 shipped, $300 local~~ **Sold!** | Bought this while I was looking for another board and ended up finding the Polaris, so this has been sitting. Will come with DZ60RGB-WKL, FR4 plate, and plate foam installed in case, without switches, but with cream C3 stabs (V2, 205g0, dielectric) pictured. Will also come with default black alu plate, case foam, and unused spacebar foam, all packaged in original KBDfans box.
MGA Standard | $300 shipped, $280 local | Black, USB-C, alu plate, and MGA foam. Bought new from Sneakbox while trying out the Alice layout but just have too many keyboards and don't wanna have it sit so just looking to sell for what I paid for it. Still new, unopened in original packaging.
Pixljar x TKC ""Keybjort"" Deskmat | $40 shipped, $20 local | Bought new from The Key Company, used for four months. My favorite deskmat I've owned but sticking with neutral color mats for the foreeseable future. Still in good condition but with one small mark on the left side and a water stain on the right side. Will come in original TKC sleeve and in Novelkeys deskmat-sized box if shipped."

~~**ai03 Vega**~~

~~Used for a few months. Truly a lovely board to type on. The anodization is well done and feels/looks great. No exterior blemishes that I can note, looks as good as the day I got it. There are some general fingerprints and dirt on random locations of the board, but no actual defects / damage.~~

~~Includes:~~

* ~~Original packaging + accessories + tools + pcb shims~~
* ~~Original case foam + plate foam~~
* ~~**1x hotswap PCB** with 205g0 Lubed C3 x TKC Bushido Stabs~~
* ~~Original aluminum plate + standoffs~~
* ~~Hotswap layout black FR4 plate (made by yours truly <3)~~
* ~~Hotswap layout white POM plate (not made by yours truly </3)~~

~~Does NOT include:~~

* ~~Keycaps~~
* ~~Switches (unless you want to bundle in the dogikons that are already on the board)~~

~~**$700 shipped/insured.** Based on other sold listing prices + the inclusion of 3x plates + the lubed c3 stabs. Kinda hard to price this thing since everyone wants a Vega but no one sells them lol.~~

**SOLD FOR ASKING***

~~**KAT Milkshake Bundle**~~

~~Used for 2 months. Lost interest in KAT profile so there's no point in keeping them around. No defects as far as I can tell. Some minor signs of usage (such as dirt/oil that comes off with a quick water+soap or denture cleaner rinse).~~

~~Kits:~~

* ~~Katakana kit~~
* ~~Modifiers Kit~~
* ~~Fruits kit~~

~~Disclaimer:~~

* ~~For the most part, only the keys that are shown in the JTK tray + the loose bag were used. Almost all of the keys that are in the original KAT trays are unused completely.~~
* ~~**Not looking to split the kits.**~~
* ~~JTK tray not included in price, but can bundle if you would like :)~~

~~**$400 shipped/insured** in original trays. Can lower price if shipped in bags. No one really lets go of their KAT milkshake sets so it was a bit hard to price this too lol.~~

TypeMachina x TGR Jane v1.5 WKL Black, Black Aluminum Plate, Brass Plate, 2 PCBs | Used for about a month or two and decided the sound signature isn't for me. There are two scuffs on the inside of the case. One of the scuffs affects the exterior and shows in-between the two halves of the case on the right side of the board. When I received the board, one of the PCBs was missing a transistor(not sure what this it's called?) causing the left alt key to not work. I rerouted it to a different switch hole and it worked fine.

Clearing out my collection of keyboards and keycaps. These are some of the favourites in my collection that I have not wanted to let go, but no point them collecting dust and unused. Better they find a new, loving home!

Price in USD.

Excludes shipping from Metro Vancouver, BC. For keycaps, they would probably be \~$10 CONUS without trays. For the Novatouch and Norbauer, that could vary quite a bit as these are quite hefty. Let me know if you are in the Metro Vancouver region and we can do a local sale.

**SOLD** **~~CoolerMaster Novatouch (silenced, lubed, and damped) - $350 + shipping~~**

~~This one was my grail keyboard for a long time. Full MX keycap compatibility, with that topre feel. Modded for that wonderful feel and thock. Silenced with KBDfans Silence X rings, superlube blend on stems and housing. These are long out of production, and is quite the end game setup if you are in to topre and MX keycaps customization.~~

~~Comes with original cable, keycap puller, manual, packaging.~~

**SOLD** **~~Norbauer Novatouch Housing in Anodized Tactical Black - $380 + shipping~~**

~~Amazing to go with the CoolerMaster Novatouch. I believe these are also compatible with CoolerMaster's other TKL boards, but I've never tried. Very hefty, fully CNC milled aluminium case. Together with the Novatouch, is an absolute stunner of a build.~~

~~Comes with original packaging, feet, allen keys, screws, etc.~~

**GMK Metropolis R1: Base, Signs Novelty, Blocks Spacebar Kit - $360 + shipping**

Beautiful keycap set, with stunning colours and that sharp GMK legend and keycap quality. These were used once, and then forgotten at the back of a cabinet as I was worried about shining them over them. Funny how that works out. (No, there is no shine on them. I hardly used them!)

Comes with original trays and packaging. I can repackage these into ziploc bags to save on shipping as well.

**DSA Think Different: Base Set, Standard Modifiers, Additional Modifiers, Numpad, Blanks - $150 + shipping**

This is a wonderful DSA with thick PBT, and Mac legends. I find PMK keycaps sound wonderfully thocky on many boards that is quite different from others. Lots of coverage here with the additional modifiers and blanks, as well as the flexibilty of the DSA profile. Should work with almost any layout.

Shipped in ziploc bags.

|Epomaker GK68XS|BNIB; was sent out to me as a replacement for my old one that got replaced under warranty. Selling at a loss because it's clearly in stock and I want someone new to the community to try a nice prebuilt. Comes with Cherry Black switches, grey-white keycaps, and an aluminum base, which is a pretty premium feel for <$200. If you're curious, link of it (currently in stock for $189 before shipping) is [here](https://epomaker.com/collections/mini-64/products/epomaker-gk68xs?variant=31813865865289).|$160 ($150 barebones)|
|~~ThicThock Marshmallows x90~~ **SOLD**|~~Lubed with Krytox 205g0 (bag lube 105g0 on the springs) and filmed with Deskey films. Not all 90 are pictured because I forgot I had them in a KBD67 lite, so yes about half were mounted once, and I can send you an imgur photo with all 90 if you want.~~|~~$105~~|
|~~GMK Noel~~ **SOLD**|~~BNIB, just the base kit. Not really looking to sell (hence the high price), mostly want to trade for other GMK sets I've been longing for.~~|~~$300 $350, GMK Rudy, GMK Mizu, GMK Oblivion (preferably Git), GMK Dualshot, GMK Olive, maybe others??~~|

~~Keycaps are preferred BNIB and listed in order of preference but I'm open to used sets; if you want to PM and ask about whether I'd be down for this set or that set I'm sure I might've forgotten about or not known about some. Regardless of whether they're used or BNIB, I will be asking for pictures per the~~ r/mechmarket ~~timestamp rules.~~

~~Thanks everyone! Hope you find something you like.~~

~~EDIT: After realizing $300 is a joke of a price compared to what~~ r/mm ~~has been selling at I'm going to hike up the price. If you've already PM'ed me you can opt out, but if you still want Noel it is going to be FCFS and I will not be doing bidding/auctioning/OBO/anything of that sort. I will be waiting for 24 hours for any trade offers to come through, and if not then it'll go to the first person in queue.~~"

Hi there everyone, I have a RAMA M60-A in the Moon color up for grabs! The board was purchased on the market about a month ago the board is in amazing condition, there are some small marks next the the screws on the back of the board and some very slight scratches next to the USB-C port which are not from me.

It's been typed on for about two weeks but I've had a couple of financial issue come up and could use the money!

The board can either come barebones with the original box or I can include some L+F Alpacas (enough to fill the board) with lubed Durock V1 stabs and it will include the internal dampener as well as the RAMA 60% feet which were replaced by me! I am not parting out the Alpacas and GMK Phosphorus will not be included so please don't ask..

Selling my Percent Studio Canoe Gen 2 in the Svart (black) colorway. I purchased it in the group buy and have really loved using it so far and it's in great condition, but I need to sell it due to some unexpected expenses. 

Built with NK Creams (Lubed w/ 205g0) and C^3 stabilizers in a matching cream color. Comes with normal gray center accent plate as well as a yellow accent plate (originally bought to match with GMK Lunar but should look good with plenty of other sets). The keycaps in the pictures were just a placeholder while waiting for the GMK sets I ordered and won't be included unless requested.

* ~~[IBM 3101 Beamspring](https://imgur.com/a/W3VRHlr) ~~1650$~~ 1500$ Nothing much to say here, just needs to be converted. Has some blemishes on the case including a big scratch on the front lip. Manufacturing date goes back to 1984. Internals are pretty much brand new. Has some surface rust on the plates, nothing to be worried about. I didn’t do anything about it because I didn’t want to alternate the zinc coating on them and wanted to leave it to the discretion of the futur owner. Would be easy to remove or seal it to make sure it doesn’t progress though. Pcb and foam is in pristine condition and the switches feel perfect. Would maybe consider a trade toward high end boards.~~ SOLD 


* ~~Prototypist Black WKL J-02 1050$
Built with L+F Thic Thoc Marshmallows switches spring swapped with 80g TX springs on a carbon fibre plate. Lubed with 205g0 and vpf1514 for the springs. Stabs are C3 Equalz and are lubed with 205g0. Gaskets were installed properly with care and precision. Board sounds and feels great to type on. Comes with original accessories. Can unsolder it if wanted. Price would be modified accordingly. Used lightly at the office for a couple weeks, board is in pristine condition, like new.~~ SOLD



* ~~Novelkeys EE Purple 140$
Second owner, used for a couple of weeks while waiting on a board. No cracks on the case and plate looks pretty good also. Stabs have been lubed and modded by previous owner. He did a pretty good job with them.~~ Pending



* Grey Tofu60 210$
Built with lubed T1’s on a brass plate and dz60 pcb using the arrow cluster layout. Lubed with 3203 and springs are lubed with vpf1514. Plate has seen a couple of builds so it’s scuffed and has some visible patina but doesn’t affect its utility. Has cherry stabs and a 7u durock stab on the spacebar. Lubed with dielectric grease. Case has seen about 2 weeks of use so doesn’t have dings or scratches. Nothing wrong with the board, I just moved on. 



* ~~SKCM brown alps 210$ 
These were unsoldered from an IBM 5140, id say the switches are about a 7.5/10 prior to any cleaning so they’d probably be pretty good if cleaned correctly.~~ SOLD

There are two scuffs on the inside of the case. One of the scuffs affects the exterior and shows in-between the two halves of the case on the right side of the board. When I received the board, one of the PCBs was missing a transistor(not sure what this it's called?) causing the left alt key to not work. I rerouted it to a different switch hole and it worked fine. PCBs will be desoldered before shipping. | Trades | Available

This will be a doozy, sorry in advance.

Comment before pm, NO CHAT, prices are shipped within the US, I will work with Canadian buyers but shipping there is usually more expensive for both of us. Bundles take priority. Pm to buy at asking price w/ paypal email takes priority.

Nightcaps/ETF Fugthulhu - Summer Daze - $100

Tealios v2 65x, lubed, soldered in, then desoldered and ultrasonic cleaned, some might still be there I didn't look at all of them - $55

Gateron Ink V2, 65x lubed 205g0 65g tx long filmed with tx iirc and cherry picked, desoldered (right bag), about 55x extra that have some (maybe 15) lubed/filmed/spring swapped and some stock (left bag). there is about 120 switches total. - $80 (cost of parts)

Keyboard:

~~Brutal60 Burgundy previously was A stock. bought from mm, had some small dings. one on the top (pictured) and one that's on the underside of the top/top of the bottom (also pictured). the second is less noticeable than the first when assembled. built with AN-C pcb, durock v1 smokey lubed with 205g0, gateron yellows lubed with 3204 iirc, 7u fr4 cannonkeys plate. will ship in the cannonkeys bag.  - $270 shipped~~  Sold desoldered without stabs for $250 shipped

~~Artisan Box:~~

~~This was the first prototype I made. the cutouts are big, the Topre/TMX holes are great, the lid doesn't sit perfectly but it's a solid chunk of aluminum that cost too much and I don't use it at all. separate album on it here:~~ [~~https://imgur.com/a/X4ZZ7aU~~](https://imgur.com/a/X4ZZ7aU)

~~Asking $100~~  sold for asking

Polaris Plates + Gaskets: ~~6~~ ~~5~~ ~~4~~ 3 SETS TOTAL - $60 each

**The kits will be sold as such: 1x BLACK POM WKL Full plate, 12x very soft gaskets, 12x soft gaskets. All will be shipped priority mail. I am not splitting parts up.**

I ordered POM plate for my personal build, and had some gaskets cut because the plate/gaskets that came with my board did not fit my preference (half brass, gasketed the plate not the board). I drew a gasket that was as close in dimension to OEM as I could get, and found a thickness that was closest to OEM (OEM is custom thickness). The end result is not too far off. Here are size examples compared to OEM Polaris gaskets: [https://imgur.com/a/BTrjGJs](https://imgur.com/a/BTrjGJs) I had 2 different types of Poron gasket material cut. One is called ""very soft"" one is called ""soft."" 3M rear adhesive.

Plates are cut via ponoko using Ai03's WKL FULL file and fit cherry switches and creams the best. **I WOULD NOT USE INKS IN THESE PLATES**, they are just too loose. Your plate will collapse.

You can test the firmness of the gaskets compared to stock and make a decision for yourself what you would like to use. I personally found the very soft gasket to be closer to the OEM Polaris gasket. I have not had the chance to build with this setup.

If you made it this far, thank you."

All you need is switches and keycaps, along with some soldering. These are great to practice on! Prices are OBO, trying to recoup costs since ENIG + blue pcb color increased prices a lot. The PCBs can be millmaxed upon request.

|1x Kit with Blue Durock V2|$80 + shipping|

This is a DIY Kit, requiring soldering of through hole components as well as switches. Build guide available [here](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c533d33348cd92b886e544d/t/5d90e24fbd027f6ecf7cfb2a/1569776210721/DISCIPAD+BUILD+GUIDE.pdf), courtesy of the designer CFTKB. I've got a total of 8 kits available, they're all mostly the same with the exception of included stabilizers. These kits are priced a bit higher due to the included add-ons (Durock v2's, foam, fr4 plate) and the PCB/back plate/mounting plate color which increased manufacturing costs on JLC.

All MCU's have been flashed with a bootloader and preloaded with VIA compatibility. Components are labeled. Flux is highly recommended for the USB C port. All kits include PCB, backplate, blue foam from u/stupidfish1 and an FR4 plate that I designed and tested.

***Trades:***

I'm looking for \*GMK Firefly, GMK DMG R2, GMK Olive, a white HHKB Pro 2 board, and a white FC660C.\*

I can make up a difference with Paypal, but I'm hoping to knock some of the price off with these kits. I'd also be interested in some obscure switches/interesting trades. If you think you have something cool, I'd be down to chat about it."

[Geekhack thread](https://web.archive.org/web/20180703134842/https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=83442.0). One of the first custom keyboards that came with hotswap sockets. I am selling a Silver V1 (low profile) with a red plate. Layout B (which is rather unconventional). 

It's actually quite a nice low-profile board. Almost not bezel to it. Here a [few photos with SA keycaps](https://imgur.com/a/p3Nmm) but it also looks quite good with GMK. Stabs need to be relubed.

Price: $160

~~Only opened the parts box to check for a part that I want for my other M65-B. The box with the board I didn't open (though one of the seal stickers does not stick).~~

Hello! Hope you guys are doing well!

I have some ramas up for sale today including the mizus. For the RAMA Mizu, the Navy GID version has been opened and mounted, but basically unmounted right after without use. The other 3 RAMAs (White Mizu, both Pono) are completely new and sealed.

I am looking to donate some cash from this sale to a local cat rescuer, can view her instagram at [.@fioloh](https://www.instagram.com/fioloh/?hl=en). She has been helping many stray cats/dogs (mainly cats) find homes, seek medical help (including surgeries) as well as helping to foster. I found her work really meaningful (especially because I like cats). Hence, I'll state 2 prices (just $10 difference), if you would like to help, you can opt to purchase the slightly more expensive price, it's perfectly okay if you don't want to. The donation will be publicly recorded at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asY5BAWSZ_pmxUy2jxmaSa1eHDddTiLQlEhGi1niuyw/edit#gid=1722981492), under tehbingg. (I hope this is allowed by the mods, otherwise please let me know, I'll be willing to remove.) Prior donations from previous sales have been made (can be seen in the spreadsheet).

I can provide more photos of the navy rama upon request:)

This would not be FCFS as I would like to prioritize the donation prices to help a little more.

YOK red linears - $35 shipped

~~FEI Matcha - $25 shipped~~ SOLD

*Condition*

GMK Olivia is in pristine condition except the outside cover, which is pretty fragile and has some creases. Used once, you'll find there is no shine whatsoever from the closeup photos. 2/3 of spacebar kit is sealed. Switches have never been tampered with. 

*Potential Trade options* 

While I'm leaning towards being paid, I would definitely consider a white/silver/black/grey Space65 for the Olivia. Feel free to amuse me with other offers. 

Switches can be traded for 70 U4T Thocky Boba switches. 

Will only reply to those who PM first. Mostly first come, first serve, though I may prioritize those with more transactions under their belt. If I don't reply quickly, it is likely I am sleeping sorry. Thank you."
