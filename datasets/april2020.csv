Hi everyone, you may remember this post from a few days (a week ago?): https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/g7iec5/usca_h_gmk_metropolis_w_gmk_8008_keycaps_trade/

Unfortunately the previous trade fell through so I am once again looking for a set of GMK 8008. The Metropolis set is in perfect condition, as it was only used on my gf's keyboard for about 5 minutes before she decided she didn't like the color-way.

I am ideally looking for a base for base even trade, ideally in the US (due to global shipping uncertainty). If you have the accents as well, we can strike up a deal or something :)

Thanks for looking!"

Hey people,

After almost a year not selling anything, I'm finally ready to get rid of everything I feel that I don't need anymore. Last year I bought my first house and started renovation everything from the inside it's almost ready and I rather have some nice furniture then 100 keyboard and keysets :) If you feel like any prices are not justified in the market just let me know I got all my prices from either what I paid for it or from other posts on mech market. 


### shipping

I will try to ship everything by Saturday, so I can have some time to pack everything and don't have to leave the house multiple times this week. Everything will be shipped with tracking and insurance, inside Europe that is between 13-25 euro. I'm quite flexible with shipping and don't mind doing 50/50 on bigger packages.

Rather want me to hold it for a while longer, I don't mind.


**Not FCFS, I prioritize bundles and EU Shipping**

**_All prices are with PP fees included_**

Hi everyone!

Hope you are all staying safe and healthy.

To get things started I'm looking for a ***Satisfaction 75 PCB*** and ***GMK Miami Nights.***

If you have either of these I would love to trade for them or I'm willing to throw lots of PayPal at you :)

Below is what I'm looking to sell today...

&#x200B;

**~~GMK 8008~~** **+ ~~Accents~~** \- ~~set was used for maybe 5 hours total typing. Its in great condition.~~ 

~~Base: $240~~

~~Accents : $65~~

~~Bundle: $300~~

&#x200B;

**~~Duck Eagle v2~~** ~~- I had this board custom anodized a blue color and it came out great honestly. This was anodized, not cerakoted, so it cost me a pretty penny to have it customized. Only selling because I have a black v3 inbound soon and don't need a duplicate (even though this is my favorite board I've used before). It will come unbuilt with a brand new, never used, DP60 pcb and a carbon fiber plate. You can see in the images the pcb still has the extra pieces on it from the manu. (If you would prefer a completed build, I have a DP60 with lubed v1 zilents on a sts plate for a few more $. Very nice sounding :)). There is a small dent on the bottom corner of the right board which was sustained from a previous owner. After a little bit you don't even really notice it anymore because the custom blue color of the case is encapsulating. $400.~~

Please let me know if you are located outside of the USA when you message me.

**Once again, I'm really looking for a** ***Satisfaction 75 pcb*** **and would pay top dollar for it. Please PM me if you happen to have one.**

Stay safe everyone and be healthy!

If you have any questions about anything please don't hesitate to ask.

Have a great day!!!!"

Good morning fellow enthusiasts! Looking to clear some of my collection that is just sitting aside. **Shipping to CONUS only** due to recent issues with international shipping. Please drop a comment then PM me with your PayPal address for the fastest possible transactions. Will likely ship out on Monday or Tuesday. *Priority to trades and multiple item purchases so* **not** *FCFS!* Will let this post marinate for potential trades until maybe 1pm PST before selling!

**~~2. SwitchCouture Acrylic Alice in Matte Black for $320 including shipping or trades~~ SOLD**

The “Malice” is from the recent Switch Couture GB built with 62g Zealios V2 lubed with 3203 and orange C3 stabs. Comes with the keycaps already installed on the board (JTK BRED + Hiney OG Spacekeys space bars). Uses Project Alice PCB so you’ll need to provide a Mini USB on your own. Not original owner but the board has seen around a month of use. In good condition but missing one bumpon in one corner (might want to look to buy better bumpons on amazon because these aren’t too sticky). It’s my first acrylic board and my first Alice board and it sounds freaking amazing, but I can not adjust to the layout so looking to pass it on. Currently flashed to [this layout on QMK.](https://imgur.com/a/mlZZXvv)

**~~3. GMK Wavez (Base + Novelties + Spacebars + Deskmat) for $300 including shipping or trades~~ SOLD**

Big fat Wavez coming in with everything you might need for a dope-looking setup. Shipped in bags, and the keycaps were only on a board for display and typed on for a few minutes when build was completed. In great condition, but note the defect on the accent Escape key in the album above. Prefer not to split kits.

**~~4. WT60-D PCB from Mekanisk for $80 including shipping~~ SOLD**

I know, seems expensive for a PCB, right? This Wilba PCB is listed under Mekanisk’s website for $60, but the shipping is freaking 25 bucks so I’m just selling it under what I paid since I no longer need it. Opened to inspect and it works fine."

Bundles will be discounted.

Note that in lieu of the pandemic, shipping through UPS or Aramex which are insured and tracked properly are **highly recommended**. This would be around 25-30$. Your other option would be Singapore Post, much cheaper but not insured fully + limited tracking.

The internal weight from Rama is installed. Included in the listing is a Seq-2 replacement solderable PCB, which is fully compatible with this board. Overall in very good condition, there are some minor defects on the case that I tried to take photos of. There is a scratch on the plate in the bottom row (see timestamp picture), and also various blemishes/micro scratches on the (pretty sensitive) brass backplate (see timestamp).The last blemish that I could find was a tiny dent on the edge, see [here](https://imgur.com/a/u9muR6W).

There are some very minor scratches/abrasions on the PVD weight. I captured these the best I could in the photos. The board is in great shape overall and has had minimal use.

I had to push the PCB into place as described on the [Rama Support Website](https://rama.works/m60a-keys-not-registering), but once it was pushed in all of the keys registered.

I also have two extra PCBs, [one hotswap and one solderable PCB](https://ramaworks.store/products/m60-a-pcb-seq2-extra). I will bundle one PCB for an additional $50 or both for $75.

Hi everyone, hope you all are staying safe. I have a set of GMK Metropolis up for adoption. I bought it for my girlfriend's keyboard, mounted it, and she didn't end up liking it so, it was removed off the board after 2 minutes of typing. Essentially, brand new!

I am really looking for GMK 8008 and am willing to add cash on top of the Metropolis set, but I am open to other offers of keycaps. I'm still kinda new to the scene, so idk all the sets that are out there. Lastly, I could also take Paypal, but I'd prioritize trades first.

First sale post on r/mechmarket so let me know if I am missing any information.

EDIT: Please comment before PM!

68 key transparent acrylic keyboard - NK creams switches soldered on. The NK cream switches are nice and smooth. I love the way the light comes through the bottom and side of keyboard. The light doesnt go through keycaps. The colors can be adjusted - multi colors and different effects as well.

Comes with black/grey keycaps shown in pictures. The ""O"" button was fixed by previous owner, works perfectly. 

The only issue is the space button stabilizer - the left stem doesn't go fully in but the right one does. Not sure how this happened but I was told it is fixable, Im new to keyboards, if I could fix it myself I would I just don't know how. The space button still works though, just the stabilizer needs work. Comes with removable USB cord, it's not USB-C . Asking $149 plus $10 USA shipping - 25% of asking price goes to charity.

~~Got a few things for sale today.~~

~~Realforce Rgb - To start off, I lost the V key, so it doesn't have a V key. Fortunatly this thing has mx mount so you can put a gmk set or whatever you want on it. I included a picture of it with sky modo on it however that keycap set does not come with it. I used this on and off for the past month with  a gmk set on it and liked it but I have decided to only have 1 Torpe board which is going to be my fc660c.~~

~~It has been lubed with 3204 on the sliders although it probably could go with a little more lube, I did it very lightly. It also has deskeys thin silencing rings and a medium thickness one for the spacebar. The spacebar was lubed with either 205g0 or de grease. I can't remember.~~

**~~Want $200 Shipped Conus~~** **Sold payment pending**

&#x200B;

Artisans - **Ill sell em all for $30 Shippe**d. One is a coz caps, one is a keylabs, two are from velocifire, the fidget spinner I got off drop, can't remember who made it, maybe hammer.

~~Hello fellow quarantiners of~~ [~~r/mechmarket~~](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/)~~, I am selling my SQUARE 80% kit. Asking for £500 + shipping. Priority to UK first, will extend to EU residents too. Not looking to ship internationally at the current moment, apologies.~~

~~You may see the board in its full glory built with GMK Minimal in the glamour shots, or view the keyboard breakdown. It is an E-White board with black accents. Inside is a heavy PVD black brass weight. If you love monochrome, this is the board for you! I bought 2 PBCs to extend the longevity of the board. It is a standard ANSI layout with standard bottom row (6.25u Space). One of the PCBs has been built on but is cleaned and like-new. I have left the white LED indicators in that PCB.~~

[~~Pics of Keyboard Components~~](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1f_kBUosV5WTe2s5JlrrdBAzay6ODpyPb)

~~This board has barely been used as I just did not enjoy the 80% layout personally. I unfortunately scratched the top case when building because I clipped some diode legs and one got under the board as I was building it. I have pictured the scratch below in as natural lighting as possible. The scratch is located above the arrow cluster. It is fairly unnoticeable in normal lighting unless you get quite close to the board. It is only a hairline scratch and only damaged the E-White coating I believe. I have reflected this defect in the price but am open for further negotiation.~~

Hey everyone, I'm starting to downsize my ""collection"" (aka I bought too many boards in too little time), and am hoping to pass the boards onto someone who will show them some love.

&#x200B;

First up is this Switch Couture stacked acrylic Alice clone in Matte Black - referred to as Malice. I have the frosted bottom plate to allow under-glow to glow through as well as the matte black bottom to swap out if wanted.

&#x200B;

It is currently built with Dark Green 67g Tangerine v2's (the UHMWPE version). I can de-solder and send it or include it all. Up to you!

&#x200B;

Also rocking GMK Calm Depths at the moment with a matching artisan that are optionally up to you to buy.

&#x200B;

Because this has a few options it will not be FCFS but instead be open to offers, with preference to entire bundles.

&#x200B;

|~~Matte Black w/ Frosted bottom Acrylic Alice (Malice)  + Alice PCB (Project Keyboard)~~|$220.00 SOLD|
|:-|:-|
|~~...Above + Tangerine 67g Switches (stock) (already mounted/soldered - will be de-soldered and fresh ""extra"" PCB supplied on the base level 220 kit)~~|$250.00 SOLD|
|~~...Both Above + GMK Calm Depths (Base Kit)~~|$380.00 SOLD|
|~~...All of the Above + Frumpzkeys Torag  Aurora Borealis~~|$400.00 SOLD|

**~~Add the extra (NEW) PCB to any of the kits that keep the current build together for an additional $30~~****.** SOLD

~~It may be tomorrow by the time I respond, so until I mark them sold feel free to send a PM (only PM's plz, not that weird chat thing).~~ Wow, I'm never opening a listing and going to bed again, RIP my inbox. I'll be in touch with everyone asap.

If you choose to go with the ""unbuild it before shipping it"" route, I could build it with whatever you'd like (either in stock or with switches you send me) as well for an additional charge. I have 205g0, 3203, 3204, and 105 to use on switches/stabs/whatever.

&#x200B;

**NOTE: CONUS, I got you on shipping. International, sorry but with the way things are I don't feel comfortable sending anything international at the moment. I've had shipping notices sitting for the last week waiting to get picked up overseas, so unfortunately keeping this CONUS. Possible ""other-US""'s for an agreed upon shipping charge.**"

&#x200B;

Decided to buy an hhkb, so I'm selling my mx board. I would say it's potential endgame as far as mx goes, with lubed + spring swapped matcha fei swithces (63.5g gold spritz), clipped + bandaid modded stabs, and gmk wavez. Willing to sell with or without keycaps. As an added bonus, I will include a set of  outemu sky blue tactile switches if you want to *switch* things up a bit.

&#x200B;

As for the condition, I've had the board for about 6 months or so, and I generally clean it once every month or so. I will also clean it up before shipping it out as well. I think the keycaps look more shiny in the picture than they are in real life but they do have a bit of shine, as is typical for any gmk set with more than 2 weeks of use.

&#x200B;

~~The asking price is~~ **~~$200~~** ~~for the board + switches, keycaps separately are~~ **~~$210~~**~~. I can include the Wavez deskmat as well, if you're interested. Prices are OBO, so feel free to make an offer.~~

great condition, would say 9/10, GMK screw in stabilizers, lubed, clipped, bandaid modded, has dampening foam inside case, brass weight, can include original stabs that came with the kit for free, keycaps not included

Main thing is that three of the case screws on the bottom are stripped, meaning that you can’t open the case, you might be able to find a way to open it, but I haven’t, there are some risks to having a hotswap board without being able to access it, check comments

Looking for ~~350~~ ~~275 + shipping~~ **decided to keep**

~~Optional: Zealios v2 62g (+60)~~ **decided to keep**

USB C 5.5 ft coiled blue and yellow with carbon techflex cable with 7” coil (+20, there is a slight tear in he techflex but isn’t very visible)

~~Extra hotswap PCB (+20, flashed with wrong firmware, wasn’t able to fix it but I’m sure someone else probably could)~~  **SOLD**

Stabs that came with the kit (free)

PM if you’re interested in any of these items by themselves.

For potential trade is a Kuro Koyu along with an M6-b. The Koyu has a hotswap PCB with screw-in stabiziliers and is bandaid modded by the original seller, all unchanged from when I purchased it. Additionally it also has the internal weight. The board is currently using Gateron Black Inks (v1) lubed with 205g0 and filmed. I'm not looking to include the GMK Minimal keycaps at this time.

The M6-b which I acquired separately is in pretty good condition aside from a couple miniscule scratches that may be visible in the photo. It has no switches on it but I can include a few Alpacas I have. At this time I'm only interested in treating the Koyu + M6-b as a set, and would only choose to sell this after purchasing something else first since it's my primary board and I still enjoy using it.

Edit: I've had several people PMing me to ask about buying this board. As stated, I'm not really interested in selling it without having another lined up, and the cost is going to be quite high (given black and white are the most popular colors, think Milk prices as a baseline) as is given market rates, how infrequently these are sold, and the fact that it has a weight and switches. Feel free to try and blow my mind with an offer, but again, I'll probably post it as a sale if and when I'm ready.

~~Also available is an assembled Romeo in a black P3D case. It currently has the 1.25/1u keys on the left side for the extra functionality (layout options on the site~~ [~~here~~](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c533d33348cd92b886e544d/1584659084907-9MIO1WET97YD9CJ2KAJT/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kK60W-ob1oA2Fm-j4E_9NQB7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0kD6Ec8Uq9YczfrzwR7e2Mh5VMMOxnTbph8FXiclivDQnof69TlCeE0rAhj6HUpXkw/layouts.JPG?format=1000w)~~). There are Alpaca linears on the board which I bought from someone else on here (which are supposed to be lubed with 205g0 and springs oiled). Using ZugGear screw-in stabilizers (put a little bit of 205g0 on through the housing after the fact, but it seemed pretty fine stock). The caps key is set for a staggered caps lock and the board is on the default layout which still needs updating.~~

~~I'm asking $185 OBO shipped CONUS for this; mainly recouping costs of all the parts with a little extra for other projects.~~ Sold for $150

Right now I'm interested in higher end polycarbonate boards such as the E6.5 or 268.2 (I'm aware of the GB coming up but seeing what's out there), or other high-end 65-75% boards. I should say I'm interested in passing in the Think 6.5, but not as much as the others due to the integrated plate which I'm trying to get away from. Same interest goes for the Satisfaction 75, depending on a variety of factors. Unbuilt/solderable builds desired as well as any extras like PCBs. I'd actually prefer to buy outright rather than trade, but I'm willing to work something out depending on interest.

Again, no rush, just seeing what's out there."

Heya, unfortunately need to let go of the following boards.

My photos might not be a good representation of the actual board, so I've linked some good ones in the last column. You can also find some pics in my previous posts.

Could provide additional photos upon request.

Priced in USD, but can be arranged for local Canadian buyers to equivalent CAD through e-transfer.

Prioritizing NA buyers, simply cuz shipping cost to EU and ASIA is absurd atm.

SOLD

~~Hello fellow quarantiners of~~ r/mechmarket\~\~, I am selling my SQUARE 80% kit. I am asking for £500 + shipping. Priority to UK first, will extend to EU residents too. Not looking to ship internationally at the current moment, apologies.\~\~

~~You may see the board in its full glory built with GMK Minimal in the glamour shots, or view the keyboard breakdown. It is an E-White board with black accents. Inside is a heavy PVD black brass weight. If you love monochrome, this is the board for you! I bought 2 PBCs to extend the longevity of the board. It is a standard ANSI layout with standard bottom row (6.25u Space). One of the PCBs has been built on but is cleaned and like-new. I have left the white LED indicators in that PCB.~~

[~~Pics of Keyboard Components~~](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1f_kBUosV5WTe2s5JlrrdBAzay6ODpyPb)

~~This board has barely been used as I just did not enjoy the 80% layout personally. I unfortunately scratched the top case when building because I clipped some diode legs and one got under the board as I was building it. I have pictured the scratch below in as natural lighting as possible. The scratch is located above the arrow cluster. It is fairly unnoticeable in normal lighting unless you get quite close to the board. It is only a hairline scratch and only damaged the E-White coating I believe. I have reflected this defect in the price but am open for further negotiation.~~

Will throw in for free the yellow USB-C cable you see at the top with this purchase, matches Serika quite well just straight braid, no coil or aviator or anything.

TX60 Antique Brass: recently bought this here, but unfortunately need the spare cash due to COVID-19. Beautiful board. Build is Milky top Gateron yellows stem swapped with UHMWPE stems and lubed lightly with 205g0. External shows absolutely no signs of wear, 10/10 condition. Inside has some machining wear but nothing out of the ordinary and not visible whatsoever when closed. Wanting what I paid, $550 shipped CONUS but shoot me some offers as I really do need some spare cash atm. Pretty much universal 60% PCB compat so if you don’t like the build easy to put a new one in there.

Hi everyone! Hope you are all doing well and in good spirits.

I recently purchased a Satisfaction75 but I need a PCB/Plate/Encoder/OLED for it. If you have any of these, please let me know as I'd love to purchase them from you.

Also looking to purchase GMK Terminal and a TX66 if anyone has one yet. 

~~I have 2 HB85's so I will be selling one of them and keeping the other. I love both colors so I'm not upset keeping either one :)~~

~~One is red with black inset, the other is silver with gray inset. Switches are 78g zilents and also have cold white leds installed for a nice backlighting effect. Also installed shelf liner for a very dampened sound. These are really unique boards and honestly amazing to type on which is why I purchased 2. But with the Satisfaction 75 I no longer need 2 of these. Both are in excellent condition and fully functional. Please note that one of them is the STT layout and the other is AOP. It will also come with the gray suede/felt? sleeve that they shipped with. Looking to get 600 since this is what I paid.~~

~~Duck Lightsaver v3 - black top and and bottom in excellent condition as well. Tried to take photos of the corners to show there are no scuffs or dents. This board has 62g zealios installed. Also I have an extra SS plate that looks fine on the top but has some scuffs on the underside (but you won't see it when its installed) and an extra PCB that has never been used. Fully functional and all LEDs are working as expected. Looking to get 600 with the the extra pcb and plate included. If you don’t want the extra pcb/plate I can sell without it for less.~~

If you have any questions feel free to PM me. Also, if you are located outside of the CONUS, please let me know that as well.

Stay Safe and be well!"

Hey guys,

Letting a few more things go to fund some GBs coming up and some that are shipping out soon. Sad to see Mizu go but I’m going to have wayy too many Blue sets around. Some things I’ve listed as trade/bundle for now as I need to hit up some people who’ve expressed interest in the past first if I’m selling outright. Would definitely like to see what trades are out there before selling. If I mark something pending especially for Mizu, can safely assume it's probably sold already. Bundles I'll definitely give a discount for each item combined (free shipping essentially for each additional item). 

**Listed price includes Paypal fees and USPS First Class shipping (Priority for Bundles/Base Kit). Will give priority as: Trades/Bundles > People with a history of wanting the thing > FCFS**

Hi guys, I'm selling a keyboard for a friend.

~~Gray KBD8X MKII from the original GB. Specs:~~

* ~~A-stock, WKL. Top and bottom are pristine with no defects, the board was barely used.~~
* ~~Brass plate, built with layout in the pictures (stepped capslock)~~
* ~~Holy Trash Pandas lubed with 3204.~~
* ~~GMK stabs lubed with dielectric grease, no rattle.~~
* ~~Mute foam installed~~
* ~~Brass weight (Disclosure: There are a few defects on the weight that came from the factory, KBDfans struggled with the brass parts if you were following the GB. Zoom into timestamps to see them and a bit hard to capture.)~~
* ~~Will ship in original packaging~~
* **~~DOES NOT COME WITH KEYCAPS~~**~~, so don't ask about them.~~

~~Looking to get $620 shipped for this board~~ **~~or best offer~~**~~. I can try to negotiate a different price but I don't see it being drastically different as it is not my board.~~

**Sold for asking,** still interested in the boards below. 

Trades:

* Silver Duck Jetfire (kit preferred)
* Silver Duck Orion V3 (kit preferred)

Will pay outright for these boards if price is right.

Thank you for reading and stay safe!"

&#x200B;

I bought the board as b-stock and cerakoted in Snow White (not bright white but a bit off-white). For reference the keycaps in timestamp are epbt 9009.

&#x200B;

There's a little mark above arrow cluster as shown, but I barely notice it. The weight only has 3 screws instead of 4 as one of the screw hole is not threaded. However, the weight still sits very secure. Other than that, the board looks great.

&#x200B;

Built with full brass plate, pre-tooled GMK screw-in stabilizers. Switches are cherry retooled blacks, lubed with 205g0, stems swapped to UHMWPE stems, 55g tx springs, clear filmed. I'll also include an extra pcb.

&#x200B;

Trades I'm looking for (+/- Paypal)

* Custom boards (linears, tkl > 75% > alice > 60%)
* Keysets (GMK, Cherry dye-sub)

All items are priced with shipping to CONUS. I may consider international but it's generally such a hassle and you will have to add a lot more.

&#x200B;

|Item|Info|Price|Status|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Monstargear Alu XO V2 Black|This is from the ""B-stock"" drop but has absolutely no cosmetic defects. Monstargear just decided to sell all of their leftover stock at B-stock prices. Just built and decided that TKL is too big for me. Used for only two days. Oblivion and Bender artisan not included. Prefer to sell with the krytox 205g0 lubed gateron yellows currently installed. Will come with all accessories that came in the box (switch puller, keycap puller, lube, stabs, USB-C cable, lube, etc.)|NLFS|No longer for sale, for now. Sorry!|
|Mizu Base + Novelties|Very lightly used on a 65%, so many keys were never put on, especially the novelties. Are completely like new. Would prefer to sell together unless I can confirm sales for both separately. EDIT: u/arcitan is willing to only cop novelties if anyone else wants to grab just the base kit|$350 for both|SOLD for ask to u/Dark_Rice_Rising|
|Enjoy PBT Sky Dolch|Still available for $80 + shipping on The Key Company, which you can find here. Barely used, and also only used on a 65% so most keys have never been touched.|$75|SOLD for ask to u/FisforFAKE|
|FC660M with MX Browns|Bought early this year and used it quite a bit, but everything is still in perfect condition and looks like new.|$80|SOLD for ask to u/heyiya|
|Summit Cables|Both are USB to Mini B. I only want to sell one of them and keep the other, so it's only one entry for them. Black and white is a 3 foot cable with 5 inch coil, and the other one (forgot the color but it's like a green teal color) I believe is a 4 foot cable with a 6 inch coil.|$50 for BW, $60 for aqua/teal/green|SOLD BW for ask to u/H3NT4I|

&#x200B;

Open to offers and trades. For trades, I'm interested in the XO Olivia RAMA caps, GMK Modern Dolch, Fjells, RAMA Thermal (I know they haven't shipped yet), TGR 910 (of course I would add on my part), and other keyboards smaller than TKL, but feel free to offer other things."

Hey everyone,

Looking to do some spring cleaning on items that are collecting dust within my closet, and I am no longer using anymore. 

~~**GMK Originative Cyrillic - $250 shipped [Pic](https://imgur.com/a/Em68unh)**~~ SOLD

~~**Can do $230 shipped without the tray!**~~

~~-Lightly used and only ever mounted twice. Bought this set, and then didn’t end up using it or the keyboard it was on very much.~~

~~GMK Red Samurai 65% Kit - $80 + shipping** [Pic](https://imgur.com/a/4nTBz7A)~~ SOLD

~~- Only used one time on keyboard for very short period, and then decided I did not like it as much as I thought I would (if are you buying the Clueboard I will through in this set for $50 with the keyboard).~~

**Clueboard v4.5 - $250 + shipping** [Pics](https://imgur.com/a/cnirVbf)

-	This has lubed and spring swapped MX Clears to make them Ergo Clears. The stem and housing is lubed with 3204, but I did not touch the legs to preserve tactility. The springs are lubed with GPL 105 and are Sprit 63.5g. It is using GMK Pretool(the good ones) stabilizers, and I lubed them with 205g0. The space bar does have a MX Zilent as I do this in all my keyboards because I hate the sound of them. If you want me to resolder it with an Ergo Clear let me know. 
-	[Sound test](https://voca.ro/hkVFsPM1hoQ)

**NIZ Plum x87 2019 - $110 + shipping** [Pic](https://imgur.com/a/arhZHNH)

-	Used this as a my work keyboard for a little while, and it was pleasant to type on. It has the 35g domes, and I have lubed the sliders with Tribosys 3204. I never used the stock keycaps on it so they are brand new. Moving on to a FC660C so no longer will be using this. Enjoyed it thoroughly when I was using it as well. 
-	[Sound test](https://voca.ro/ocq9if21KXp)

As well for a final note I’m looking to try some SA keycaps, but not necessarily go full out on them. Looking to try Maxxkey for example, and not something on the higher end like Signature Plastics kits. Let me know what you have!

Hope everyone is enjoying their Wednesday, and thank you for stopping by. Please comment before PM! Thanks everyone!"

Hello! Just finished my new KBD75v2 build and looking to top it off with some new GMK Pulse keycaps! Also clearing out things I no longer need or use. **All prices include shipping to CONUS**. International shipping can be discussed.

I really want GMK pulse - Ideally base kit + novelties, but I'll take just the base kit too. I'm willing to trade anything or any combination of things listed below for GMK pulse and balance out with Paypal as necessary.

Not really interested in artisan trades unless it's something in a pulse colorway.

Bought off MechMarket 2 years ago and I cannot get used to SA profile. All included keys pictured [here]( https://i.imgur.com/W1TK2qb.jpg) (old timestamp).
**Ducky One** | **$80** |  Cherry MX brown switches, PBT side print keycaps. Will ship in original box with micro USB cable and red accent keycaps that it came with.
**GMK Ocean Dolch** | As part of a trade for GMK pulse **ONLY** (Will sell separately if I get GMK Pulse another way)| This set has been on a keyboard that I use daily for a while now. There is shine on the more used alphas, the thumb positions on the spacebar (in a flipped spacebar orientation), and the enter key. **THE KBD75 THE KEYCAPS ARE ON IS NOT FOR SALE/TRADE!** I just wasn't going to remove all the keycaps to take a timestamp

SHIPPING CONUS ONLY SORRY FORGOT TO MENTION

PRICES ARE SHIPPED BUT DONT INCLUDE PAYPAL FEES!

Hello mechmarket! Trying to rid the collection of things I don't have a use for Mainly looking for paypal, but trades are always welcome.

Please look at all the photos as the lighting when I was taking photos is crap so some photos have flash on to help.

WANTS: A keyboard with the Alice layout, really been wanting to try one for a while now, this is my #1

Someone with enough knowledge to convert any of the vintage keyboards I have, if DIY / programming is your jam, HMU!! I have some very unique boards I need adapted and will make it worth your while!!

Colorful GMK sets

Aluminum case 96 key keyboard or TKL

**HAVES:**

**Og cherry doubleshots beige 1800 set - $70 shipped - sold**

Layout as shown, selling keycaps only. A bit dusty from sitting on a top shelf in the basement, but otherwise almost no shine. Keycap set only\*

**Cherry pos keyboard $50 shipped**

Needs a new cable to be wired in, switches are mx brown, has full pbt keycap set but a few of the clear covers on the function keys are missing. Board is overall in very good condition otherwise, doesn't appear to have gotten much use at all.

**Black at101w - $60 shipped**

Black alps in good condition, this board also doesn't appear to have been used much. This board really is a looker compared to the beige version!

**2x 911 dispatch keeb - $70 shipped each one sold** 

Boards seem to be made in early 2000s but the mx blacks are extremely smooth, not sure if this is because theyre vints or because they look to have seen a LOT of constant operation (which for blacks about the best thing for them)

One of the keyboard’s caps have been so extensively used they are WEARING through and you can see other parts of the doubleshot mold, switches are surprisingly clean and extremely smooth on this one.

The other ones caps are totally fine and its switches are also very smooth, but not as smooth as the one that clearly got a metric buttload of use.

Despite condition being very different, price is same for either board, the reasoning behind this is the very heavily used one’s switches are much smoother and more desirable, but its caps are slightly damaged. The other one looks to be hardly ever used, the backplate is pristine. This ones cap set is better but switches are less smooth than the well used one.

Almost new nec blue oval board: $80 shipped Same board as the other one but this one is not yellowed at all and has extremely little use on the switches. Practically NOS which is extremely hard to find for this already slightly uncommon board.

NOS NMB black clicky space invader split spacebar full size keyboard $150 shipped OBO This version of this board is significantly harder to find, as it has a split spacebar and windows button. Dip switches on the back control the split space, keyboard came to me covered in plastic and appears to be NOS. Got it and used it for a week before deciding to pass it on. This thing is a real gem.

**Bag of weird vintage cherry clone linears - $30 shipped - sold** 

Came from a old chicony board I used for a project. Intermediately weighted linears, not terribly smooth but I never cleaned or did anything with them besides trying them for about a minute right when I got the board. I don't see any branding on them, and despite the weighting being the same across the board, the sliders are atleast 3 different colors. Not sure what use someone will have with these but hopefully someone can make something interesting with them!

**Off brand beige bold cherry like doubleshots (MX mount) - $25 shipped without tray** (tray isn't really even a tray but a piece of the keyboard these came from lol) Layout as shown.

**Wyse keyset - $40 shipped**

Layout as shown, no yellowing. Pretty unique off shade of grey to my eyes.

**2x bags of 100x wyse vints - $80 shipped each both sold.**

**Vint. Blacks from wyse pack #3 - 98x asking $75 shipped - sold**

Desolered from 1986 wyse keyboards, pretty smooth already but if youre buying vints you would be doing yourself a disservice not lubing them!

**71x orange alps (8/10 condition) - $55 shipped** May have one or two broken keycap stems inside, can be easily removed by taking switch apart. Desoldered from an apple keyboard

**62x amber alps from a apple computer $75 shipped - sold**

**90 blue alps desoldered from chicony keyboard + a few blue alps parts (6.5/10) - $80 shipped** These definitely need to be cleaned in an ultrasonic as they were kinda scratchy when I tried them, click leaves still seem very crisp though. A cleaning and some light lubrication and theyll feel amazing again. - sold

**117 white alps desoldered from omnikey 102 (8/10) Asking $100 shipped** obo Neatly desoldered from a board that looked like it didn't get much use to begin with.

**82 green alps desoldered from zenith keyboard (6/10 condition) - $40** Not the greatest condition, but once you ultrasonic and lube them theyll be good as new - sold

**Brand new alps mount beige 1800 layout keycap set - Asking $30 shipped** I am no expert but I think theyre pad printed, nice sharp legends, came off of a NOS board I harvested for switches. No yellowing at all. Unused. Will be shipped in a bag. sold 

EDIT:  [https://imgur.com/a/eVPBzY9](https://imgur.com/a/eVPBzY9)  layout as shown sorry

&#x200B;

**Bag of black RRE vintage cherry clones - free with purchase of anything else.** Desoldered from vintage wyse board, these are clones, and were less pleasant than normal mx blacks to type on, but maybe someone wants to make a frankenswitch? gone 

**Vintage keytronic keyboard assembly from a terminal computer. $50 shipped** I am building an arcade cab out of a old dumb terminal, and this was the keyboard inside it. Keytronic tall switches, beautiful thick doubleshot caps. Id love to see someone make something with this! - traded 

**NMB Linear white space invader terminal board - Asking $60 shipped** \- Amazingly this keyboard does function mostly (some keys don't output any code and others are more or less macro keys that register as a combination of keys pressed. Keyboard is pretty crusty but switches are still very very smooth. Nice apple reminissant font on the keycaps, overall very good build quality. Numpad enter is missing, and numpad delete has a missing slider. Slider from numpad enter could be transplanted on for one working one. Numpad delete keycap included.

**NMB RT101 with white lubed linear space invaders and green pbt dyesubs - Asking $100 shipped** This board is pretty unique in that the legends on the keycaps are in a dark green, and a unique thin font too. I ultrasonic’d the switch tops and keycaps, and then tried to lube the sliders with superlube, and I am not sure if I overlubed the switches or if i just don't really like space invaders. (honestly think I just don't like space invaders as the clicky version was also too heavy for me) Lubing them made them VERY smooth and VERY thocky, but also seems to made them slightly heavier too. I used it for about a week after cleaning and lubing and it is very fun to type on, but my weak little child fingers need lighter switches. Case of the keyboard is kinda yellowed, I was planning on retrobriting it but I will leave that to whoever buys it now. - sold

**Pixelpower monstrosity: Asking $100 shipped.** This thicc boy was used for inserting graphics over live video, think broadcast environment. Uses cherry mx browns. Whole board is very clean and well kept. Huge metal backplate, tested working over ps/2. Dark blue plastic for the case and matching keycaps.

**Northgate Omnikey 102 - asking $150 shipped - traded** 

Was bought NOS by my friend who sold it to me, almost no dirt at all as Ive kept it clean. NOS white alps are dank.

I have GMK Dots, opened for photos. Typed on for.. uh.. 5 minutes. I swapped to my other board right away because I didn't feel that WOW factor. The actual blue of the caps is just slightly too close to the blue of my board so I didn't end up liking it as much as I thought I would. The gray dots also feels out of place, IMO. Set looks beautiful and aesthetic, but not my preference.

BTW, extras going on sale tomorrow on zFrontier. If you wanna try your luck with that, feel free! The NK sale for these dots was pretty rough. My one friend was up on time and missed it. He was able to acquire another set from someone else already, though.

A bit of a rare bird for y’all today.  This is a dark grey Tina A case, in true HHKB layout, with teal weight. This is for the case only - no build is included.

I put metal HHKB stickers on it because I liked the look, but they will easily come off if that's not your thing.

Comes with leather carrying case.

Notice: One of the six case screws is stripped but it has had no effect in performance.  Can easily use a larger size screw or use locktite.

I’m asking ~~$150~~ SOLD, including both PayPal fees and shipping within the US.

Things I’m looking for if you happen to have them (+\- as appropriate):

-	sparkle loft pulse reactor artisan
-	other pulse/1976/9009 themed artisan
-	two rama “X” artisans (gmk)
-	60% or 65% PC case
-	40% build maybe
-	mt3 or KAT keyset
-	keebwerk nano
-	unbuilt discipline kit
-	always looking for nice pens too

Before you continue reading, there is currently a GB running for the Rukia that ends on the 17th [here](https://www.mintautumn.com/store/p1/Polycarbonate_Rukia.html#/). Go support the designer directly, this listing is for those that don't want to wait.

In terms of trades, I am only interested in R2 CRP Tulip + WKL childkit, R2 CRP Desko + WKL Childkit, nothing else. In terms of boards, I am only interested in other high-end POLYCARBONATE boards only in any form factor that is EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN a 60%, nothing else. No artisans.

***All prices include shipping insurance and required signature. I am only shipping within CONUS, I will not ship to, sell to or trade with anyone that is international. Please don't PM me with an offer lower that the asking price as the price is already less than what I paid for, if nothing sells then oh well... I guess i get to keep an awesome board.***

Please comment before PM, priority goes to bundles. Priority also goes to those who don't waste my time and PM with their PayPal email ready for an invoice.

Hello! Selling some stuff to fund a new build. All prices include shipping to CONUS. PM me for international shipping and we can discuss. 

For trades, I really want GMK pulse. If you want to trade your GMK set for my SA set let me know! Ideally I need the base kit + novelties, but would take the base alone. Willing to balance out with Paypal as necessary.

If you want to trade another artisan for the Fugu, it would need to be something in a pulse colorway.

Hello!

Any issues with my prices or you want to shoot a diff offer Im open to it just message me, I can be swayed (very easily sometimes). Not looking for any trades or anything like that right now.

Everything will be shipped tomorrow **(Friday)** unless something crazy happens then it will be shipped on **Monday**.  I will let you know! Im in NY so things are a little crazy right now. **I WILL MESSAGE YOU WITH TRACKING WHEN AVAILABLE/ANY OTHER UPDATE** you don't have to keep messaging me.

**CONUS Only**. Might do Canada. If you are international and you message me I will consider shipping to you if no one in the states reaches out to me for said item by end of the day. By reaching out i mean through messages and not chat! If you have no gotten a response from me this is why.

Let me know if you want more pictures or something?

**Comment before PM please. No chats...I WILL ignore you.**

Not FCFS. Priority to those I have sold to before

**\*side note\* if you are one of the people that have messaged me before and ended up playing games with me when it came time for payment I will not sell to you. This goes for anyone in the future as well. \[I will not put any item on hold\]**

Rama M60-A SEQ 2 Milk Hotswap: TRADED FOR THINK 6.5 PC Hotswap

The time has come and I KNOW... it’s high. I would rather trade for a Think 6.5, will also consider any polycarb boards %60 or above (no HHKB) and also any TKLs polycarb or not and prefer Hotswap. If it’s under/over price I can throw cash on PayPal or trader can. If you think you have a worthy trade just throw me a pm all I can say is no. 

With regards to the board itself, it’s beautiful. I purchased it when Rama put up extras, I assembled it took some pictures took the switches and caps off and it’s just been sitting boxed up. I planned on using it, but it was my first HHKB and it is not my style at all. I will include clipped and lubed GMK screw-in stabs as well if buyer/trader would like. Another thing I would like to add is I originally sold the boards backweight (silver for gold) and the only flaw is the left side of the weight which I tried to show in the pictures. I purchased it like this from someone on mechmarket. 

Keyforge Sakura Mulder: $40 shipped

Love Keyforge but I never use this because I dislike pink.

* It's also just a bit rough around the [hole](https://i.imgur.com/4VA2Rtb.jpg) for the USB.

* Finally, there are a few small [grooves](https://i.imgur.com/LBLDWdJ.jpg) along the edge of the case here that are hard to see, but that you can feel if you run your finger over it.

I'm also open to any other GMK set that you think would match with my board [love tkl](https://i.imgur.com/Dl6Z6Qn.jpg). I'm pretty set on GMK DMG though.

My primary focus is to get GMK DMG. I would be open to $300 Paypal, but priority goes to anyone who has GMK DMG."

Hi! I bought this board from another user who won the cerakote raffle from keycult, which raffled 5 No. 1/60s. 
I recently bought another board so I’d like to sell this one to offset the load.

Here’s the link to the album: [more pics](https://imgur.com/a/2SYNIhz)

The only flaw, as stated in the keycult raffle, is a cerakote flaw which you can see on the left side of the board in the first pic. It’s a discoloration of the bottom piece of the board. Also, there are two tiny specks on the top left from the cerakote as well. Personally, the flaws never bothered me, especially in non-harsh lighting conditions. It can definitely be recerakoted. Other than that, it’s a beautiful board with no scratches or dents. 

The board will come with 205g0 lubed gat ink V2s, alu plate, and gmk stabs. I have a pom half plate and fr4 half plate coming (might take a while) so you if you buy the board, I’ll send these to you if you handle shipping later on.

Hi all, thank you for reading in advance!

Today I am looking to sell or trade my GMK Jamon as I don't find myself using it all that much. Has no shine, as all keys still have texture from the looks of it. Very minimal usage. The banderole still has the shrinkwrap on it.

Hello! Selling some stuff to fund a new build. All prices include shipping to CONUS. PM me for international shipping and we can discuss. 

For trades, I really want GMK pulse. If you want to trade your GMK set for my SA set let me know! Ideally I need the base kit + novelties, but would take the base alone. Willing to balance out with Paypal as necessary.

If you want to trade another artisan for the Fugu, it would need to be something in a pulse colorway.

Hello!

Will try to ship everything on **Wednesday**, but if I cant it will def go out **Friday**. I will let you know! Im in NY so things are a little crazy right now. **I WILL MESSAGE YOU WITH TRACKING WHEN AVAILABLE/ANY OTHER UPDATE** you don't have to keep messaging me.

Any issues with my prices or you want to shoot a diff offer Im open to it just message me, I can be swayed. Not looking for any trades or anything like that right now.

**CONUS Only**. Might do Canada. If you are international and you message me I will consider shipping to you if no one in the states reaches out to me for said item by end of the day. By reaching out i mean through messages and not chat! If you have no gotten a response from me this is why.

Let me know if you want more pictures or something?

**Comment before PM please. No chats...I WILL ignore you.**

**\*side note\*** if you are one of the people that have messaged me before and ended up playing games with me when it came time for payment I **will not** sell to you. This goes for anyone in the future as well.

Good Afternoon /r/mechmarket 

2 Things up for sale today:

**MHKB E-Series**

~~I am the original owner after purchasing this from Evan and his small Group buy last year.  I bought this board in all teal, and just recently traded someone switch plates to give it the 2 tone look.  As you can see in the photos, there is a small ""ding"" in the bottom left corner of the switch plate that is visible on my build.  It's slightly noticeable but I stopped being a perfectionist in this hobby a while ago and I just like having the 2 tone look on the board.  There is also a VERY TINY ding on the back side near the USB Port, I tried my best to capture it, and if you look at the photo it is to the left of the USB port when looking at the 8th photo in the album.  Also there is naturally some scrapes from swapping out the switches on the switch plate, but you'll never see them when the board is put together.~~

~~The board comes with the case, hotswap PCB, (all sockets are good and working correctly and all 3 indicator LEDS function correctly too.) and lubed, clipped screw-in genuine GMK stabilizers.  It's a nice board, it's got good weight to it and it's served me well, but I'm selling to fund some new PC upgrades for my gaming rig.~~

~~I'm asking $340 O.B.O. shipped CONUS with PP Fees Included.~~

**SA Hyperfuse R2**

~~What's included in the set minus the 6U spacebar:  (See below)~~

~~https://www.originativeco.com/products/sa-hyperfuse~~

~~Picked up this set a few months ago and I barely use it.  It's been sitting on one of my boards but I realize that I'm not a huge SA fan anymore and these should go to someone who will use them.  There is light shine but this set is already smooth and shiny to begin with.  It's in near perfect condition otherwise.~~

~~When I bought the set, it didn't include the stock spacebars.  Only a 6.25U from what appears to be either SA Doom or SA Grand Budapest.  Either way it wasn't a perfect match, so I went ahead and ordered a 6.25U and 7U in the correct Grey color from PMK.  The 6.25U has been mounted and used, but the 7U is still BNIB.~~

~~I'm asking $195 O.B.O. shipped with PP Fees included CONUS.~~. SOLD FOR $180

**WANT**

I'm also looking to separately purchase JTK Debut (PoW) if you have it.

Unfortunately, I have been out of work for the past two weeks and need some money.  I built this a week ago and used it once or twice. The keyboard works fine, however, the spacebar doesn't always return properly I've tried lubing the stabs more and tightening/loosening the screws on the stabs. The board will also come with 9x extra T1 tactile switches not lubed.

### ~~NEC PC-8801 Blue Alps Keyboard~~ sold

- Very clean 8801 with Blue Alps (grey switchplate). Old 15-pin connector.
- Haven't verified functionality but keys all feel great, opened to check switchplate and slider, feel 9/10, only some slight dust on the bottom of the switch, nothing in the top housing.
- Case and keycaps (katakana dye-sub pbt alphas, doubleshot abs alphas) are unyellowed
- Caps appear to be relatively unused without much shine. Original texture seems to be all there. 
- Original coil/cable in good condition and clean as well.
- Plate has some chipped spots. Gave it a wipe down. I have a plate in better condition that I could include as a spare if desired.

~~Price: $240 shipped (via surface mail)~~

- Can build pro micro hasu adb adapter for $15 (required to use, board uses adb)
- Includes original box and adb cable. I can also include spare parts as needed.
- Will create typing video for interested buyer

### ~~Toshiba J3100GL spare keyboard~~ sold

A spare part for the Japan-exclusive version of the T3100 ""laptop"" computer, a bit different from the one I had last time as this one was marked for the GL variant. This is the last one of these that I have, haven't been able to find any more. These use Alps Common Mount Low Profile (SKFM/SKFN), but still have OG Alps doubleshots with lots of Hiragana sublegends (and some printed front legends as well!). The color scheme is a white text on very light grey, with slightly darker grey mods - like a lower contrast Oblivion/MoDo. 

- Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/z3sAS3u (please ignore the lack of spacebar in these detailed pictures, I've found it and will be including it)
- [The KLE layout for the GT version.](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/8a06796d2c16c3ac42eb5387351cc586) I haven't drawn one up for this version yet.
- Alps SKFL, PCB Mount. PCB cloth cover missing. However, plastic cover + original Alps manufacturer sticker remains on the back.
- OEM profile Alps-made thick doubleshot keycaps with Hiragana sublegends.

Price: ~~$80 shipped (via airmail)~~

### Keycaps

##### Apple AEK II JP Keycaps

- Apple Alps dye-subbed keycaps with JP sublegends, in extremely good condition. Spacebar is non-yellowed but has a bit of shine. Spacebar comparison to NOS: https://imgur.com/a/4sgFqzb

Price: $100

##### Apple IIGS Keycaps

Price: $20

##### NEC PC8801 Keycaps

- doubleshot grey on beige, grey mods

### WANT

##### ~~Nexus alps sliders~~

- I know these have a bunch of issues, but I want to try some with Alps linears since there isn't a clickleaf to crush. I'd like to get around 100 if possible. Or if you have any news of a second round with fixes then please tell me. I only need the sliders since I'll be modifying original alps housings for them.

Hello! Selling some stuff to fund a new build. All prices include shipping to CONUS. PM me for international shipping and we can discuss. 

For trades, I really want GMK pulse. If you want to trade your GMK set for my SA set let me know! Ideally I need the base kit + novelties, but would take the base alone. Willing to balance out with Paypal as necessary.

If you want to trade another artisan for the Fugu, it would need to be something in a pulse colorway.

I got 2 more bare bones (no caps, no switches, no stabs) keyboards up for sale today: [时间戳记](https://i.imgur.com/rji83f2.jpg)

Item | Info | Price
---|---|----
~~Massdrop CTRL~~ | ~~Low-Profile~~ | ~~115 USD (price includes shipping)~~ Sold
~~GMMK 60%~~ | ~~Has full per key rgb~~ | ~~35 USD (price does NOT include shipping)~~ Sold

Let me know if prices are wack. 

If you want both for some reason it'll be 150USD (I'll throw in a set of stabs for free too).

Lubed plate mount stabs can be included for +10USD

I also have enough gateron clears lubed with 3203 (x60) to bundle with the gmmk for +10USD.

I can sell the switches separate if you want em for 10USD but you cover shipping costs.

I am willing to trade the boards for mono-legend japanese keycaps. Some examples: [This](https://novelkeys.xyz/products/gmk-wob-hiragana?variant=29012088815709), [This](https://www.deskhero.ca/collections/group-buys-upcoming/products/gmk-masterpiece?contact%5Btags%5D=prospect%2C+newsletter&form_type=customer#footer_newsletter_static-footer-1). I am open to offers. I am also willing to buy straight up.

If you have any questions please post them in the comments or pm me.
