To make it easier for buyers:

\- Shipping prices in eu generally are 4-15 euros (depends on various reasons (if it untracked or tracked), how big is the package)

**PLEASE READ. FAQ:**

* *Should I leave comment before PMing?*
   * YES. Please COMMENT before ***PMing*** me, without comment ***PMs*** will be ignored. Chat is ignored or refered/linked to PM. For those who are new here on reddit (as I was myself when started to make posts here) ***PM*** is more like email conversation, while chat is like messenger conversation thus for trade PM is needed.
* *You are from EU, are you shipping to U.S. / Canada?*
   * Sending to U.S. is possible BUT will be more expensive and it is your as buyer responsibility to pay that. I don't trust cheap shippings for such long distances during pandemic so use proxies for fedex and dhl to sent to usa. Feel free to pm me, even if I show no price to U.S./CANADA. To make it easier I usually include shipping and pp fees on more expensive items. All customers chose more expensive shipping option which get you the item from 2 to 7 days (which is usually 30-80 euro depending on item weight and size). If you really want, I can try sent with cheaper one (2-3 months), but it will be at your own risk (which is usually from 15-35 euro depending on weight (till 2kg, from 2kg it gets exponentially expensive too)).
* *How is shipping during pandemic generally from your own experience?*
   * EU shipping is not as fast as before due to pandemic - from my experience now it takes 2-3 weeks to receive (untracked), but this is eta - everything falls down to shipping company eventually. Overseas shipping is more expensive thus the one I recommend (FEDEX/DHL) generally, in most cases, tend to be much faster. I recently added an option to choose slow shipping option, but I don't recommend it for expensive items (its like USPS) - choose this for those at your own risk.
* *Are prices correct?*
   * All prices are correct.
* *How are you selling?*
   * My rule of selling fcfs: communication first of who first wrote, but if there is no further communication after pming from the person (any reply/explanation in a few hours) or doubtful excuses and there is a second person who wants same product and is ready to pay - product get the one who pays. Also, if you are quite sure you want chosen item, it would be great if you provide your mail, so I could sent invoice faster without needing to wait for message.
* *Are you holding the item?*
   * No. Unless you are very serious and partially pay (with no refund), but generally no.
   * Why? I am usually not holding item for anybody if not paid, because from my own experience 99.99% persons who asked to wait didn't buy the item. If you are unsure about item just write that and move on (the item may or not be sold later on, but I won't feel uncomfortable if it will) :)
* *If you have any questions, write something like* **""I have a question, pm""** *and ask it* **PM** *not here .* **All other comments** *which are not refering to PM on post* ***mostly*** *are* **IGNORED** *(or with an instances if commenter is mod) and if they happens to be threadcapping (something like: ""lower the price"" ""because I want to sell my own set and threadcap your post so your would be ignored"") or toxic - reported. Thank you for your understanding <3*"

**PLEASE READ:** 
I have for sale a B-STOCK monstargear K80 in burgundy built with boba U4T switches and durock V2 stabs (keycaps not included). **Looking for a local sale in Toronto only, but will open up shipping if it doesn't sell.** Additionally, the gaskets monstargear provide are very thin and have been heavily compressed by the screws, as shown in the photos due to the thinsulate dampener (board still sounds and feels good tho). You can always remove the gasket strips and opt to sandwich mount it instead. 

**And lastly please note as this is a b-stock board there are a few issues:** 

1. The bottom case color is slightly darker than the top case (shown in photos)

2. Anodization/paint scuff behind the top case (also shown in photos and is obviously not seen at all when assembled)

**What's included:** 

- Original box and accessories - the braided USB-C cable isn't included.

- 1x soldered PCB
 
- 1x FR4 plate (installed)

- 1x Alu plate

- Some leftover gasket strips

- Thinsulate acoustic dampener

- Durock V2 lubed w/ 205g0

- Lubed and filmed boba U4T's 
  - tribosys 3203 and deskey films. I lubed the boba's using gazzew's recommended lubing technique which can be found [here](https://youtu.be/hVZuiK3BgoY?t=109)

**Asking $415 CAD** (price for just the board itself with the extra gasket and plate will already cost you $380USD without duties)

**SOLD SOLD SOLD**

People still PMing me clearly didn’t read the post…

This is a barely used base kit of GMK Darling, **however** a couple of keys are missing. The **7u spacebar, 2u numpad ""+"", the non-accent numpad enter, and non-accent up arrow** are all missing. Please see the timestamp to understand what is included. The set is in good condition and shouldn't have any shine (I included pics in the timestamp, but it was difficult to capture). 

If you want to compare it to what was included in the original base kit, here's a picture of the [GB render](https://imgur.com/a/teVrpDZ).

Due to the missing keys, the list price is **$350 shipped CONUS**. The keycaps will be shipped in bags (no OG packaging).

I'm clearing out some things I don't need anymore to help fund a trip to see someone special.

I had a lot of trouble pricing all of these since I couldn't find any recent sales for any of them. For that reason, I want to make it clear: **I'm open to offers on all items, even if it's far below asking price**. You can send them to me at any time, but I'll probably wait until this listing's been up for a few days before I start considering offers below list price so if you don't hear back from me straight away, don't worry.  Obviously, FCFS at the asking price :)

I'm willing to ship all items internationally. In regards to Wise/bank transfers, I don't have much rep on mechmarket, but I've been active since 2013 on GH/DT with countless (hundreds) sales/trades done. Plenty of people in the community can vouch for me.

**For the NCR set and the Packard Bell, please make sure to inspect the condition albums and writeups fully. They're both used items and have some damages, which I've tried my best to fully document. Especially in the case of OG dyesub sales, this isn't something you often get; usually sets like this will be listed vaguely as ""used"".**

**When I made the listing there was an error in the DSA Granite bundle, I'd forgot to include a kit in the photo galleries. To be clear: Each DSA Granite bundle contains 6 kits and 3 extra spacebars: Elven tongue, common kit, icon modifiers, text modifiers, windows kit, bonus pack, 2x 7u spacebars and 1x 6.25u spacebar.**

Hey MM!

I've recently acquired a bunch of endgame boards and need to clear out some of my lesser used boards. Please read carefully and let me know if you have any specific questions!

**NOT FCFS**

**NO SPLITS**

**Not currently interested in trades**

**Shipping preference is CONUS > INTL** \- I'm happy to ship anywhere so long as buyer covers shipping costs and import taxes. **NOTE TO AUSTRALIA**: USPS is currently not shipping via any service so the only options I have are UPS or FedEx, both of which are very pricey (\~$100-200USD for a board).

Items are **Available** unless **~~crossed out~~**

**Please do NOT use the new chat feature!!** Chat is the thing on the BOTTOM-right. I'm mainly on mobile and chat doesn't work on mobile so please use the old messaging system on the TOP-right!

* **Percent Canoe** Black with grey plate and weight. Build with lubed 62g Zealios and GMK Screw-Ins. Very good condition. **390€** 

* **Fox Orange TKL** Purple with sky blue alu plate. Build with 67G lubed Zealios and GMK Screw-Ins. Condition is very good but the tolerances were too tight on this board. This results in the underside of the PCB, or the legs of the switches, hitting the case causing weird behaviour. So something isolating has to be put inbetween resulting in the case not closing 100%. So theres a tiny gap between the upper and lower case. This problem is very common on this board and a design flaw. **320€**

***Both Extensions + Latin Alphas sold for $60***

---------------------
~~Gothic 70:
Built with 205g0 lubed and filmed alpacas, soldered. Springs swapped to Gateron Yellow springs. Stabs are a variety of durock and everglide stabilizers, all holee modded and lubed with 205g0. One of the middle plates has a broken part that I mended with super glue, thankfully you can't see it unless you really focus with the frosted acrylic on top. Tape modded with electrical tape on the back to give it that ""marble-ly"" sound. There is the included foam installed between the pcb and plate. There are aluminum rubber feet installed to give the board some angle.
There are some things that I tried wiring on the back of the board but I think all of it was useless since I think all of the issues came from the humidity in the air messing with the pcb. 
I would love to salvage my spring swapped alpacas but I really can't be bothered de-soldering this entire board anymore.
*Looking for $190 shipped, OBO, for the board within the CONUS*~~
*Sold for $160 offer*

-------------------------------------
GMK Laser:

I mostly used the gaijin alphas, and I'm pretty sure the cyberdeck alphas are basically untouched. I might've mounted it onto a board once to take some pictures.

These will come shipped in bags since the flimsy original GMK packaging fell apart right when I opened it. There is some slight shine on the keycaps that I rest my hands on(e.g. wasd, spacebar). Scuffed video attempting to show the shine in timestamp album.

~~*Looking for $170 shipped, OBO. I am willing to part them if there is no more interest in this set.*~~

*Looking for $60 shipped for just the Gaijin set*

Hi Guys, looking to sell my set of GMK Red Samurai keycaps, as you can see from the photos they are barely used. Less than a day's typing total so absolutely no shine (they do need to be dusted, and I will clean them properly prior to sending).

I love this Keycap set, think it looks great especially with black / wood keyboards but sadly this hasn't been used as I thought the novelty set had 2u keys but it didnt. So sadly selling this as it isn't compatible with my form factor. Wish I had stuck to 2.25u left shift...but live and learn.

Both for £120 (OBO), happy to sell the novelties alone but not the TKL set without the novelties."

Also would trade n:1 for a cool top mount board, don't really have any thing in mind but something like a QXP would be cool, any layout is fine as long as it's not a 40. Also Im local to 95131

Today I have for sale:

**E6-V2 R1 Founders Edition # 29/33**

My first custom keyboard and one of my favorites due to its clean look. Some people think its too gamer-y but its hard to argue that black and red weren't meant for one another.

Comes with:

Currently built with Cherry Reds. Would love to sell with limited Typehype Rama and JTK Red on Black caps. Has 4 name tags in total, all unsigned: black, red, blue and brass. Includes extra brass plate, and unused PCB. Extra Brass Weight denoting the number. Also will include second brass center piece. Original Box. Will include TX Bag instead of OG box if buyer wishes if sold at or around asking. Asking $800 + Shipping Keycaps extra.

**E7-V1 SE - 1 of 30**

My latest purchase. Excuse the mix of caps on it at the moment. This was waiting for GMK Masterpiece.

Comes with:

Currently built with Holy Pandas. Will come with extra limited edition brass weight. Extra unused PCB and white aluminum plate as well. Original Box as well. Will include TX Bag if sold at or around asking. Asking $800.00 + Shipping SOLD

**GMK Vaporwave + RAMA**

Minimal use, no shine. Was thrown on my board and then never used. Comes with RAMA. Can ship with tray or in bags. $400 + Shipping

Looking to sell these puppies to fund a basement gym. Not really super up to date on prices so if I'm super off base feel free to make a reasonable offer. Worse thing I say is no.

Canadian buyers preferred. Open to negotiation, especially if buying more then one board. Open to trades, but actively pursuing cash."

Saturn 60 Supernova: Board is built with Tealios 67g. Barely been used after being built as I have more than one of these boards, so the board is like brand new. 

$340 Shipped CONUS

NOTE: if you want the Keycaps pictured as well (GMK WOB) I can include the set for an extra $80 onto the price, but will not be separating.

&#x200B;

Yuikkp Prototype: this was a prototype board i commissioned from Yuikkp in the community. the board has a chip in the back (came that way) and comes in a cool ""Thunderberry"" Color. its a nice heavy board. I will include a KBDfans67 Solderable PCB with it as well. I am hoping this can be a first build board for someone who wants a nice board to try soldering on at an affordable price. NOTE DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE ARE NOT SOLDERING (the case and plate are one piece so the only way to attach the PCB is by soldering.)

First listing here, trying to downsize my keyboard collection step by step that grew ridiculously over the course of the pandemic and focusing on quality > quantity instead for myself.

I can ship anywhere to CONUS, never shipped anything worldwide before but we can probably work something out if you're elsewhere. I'm also local to 92802 so local pickup is also an option. What you see is what you get, prices listed are just my own general rough estimate but honestly I'm pretty open to negotiating or hearing offers since I primarily just want to downsize my collection. Comment before PMing so I know you're not a scammer.

|*KBD67 Lite R2*|This keyboard was purchased off of another user off of r/mm earlier this month. I had been looking for a new board to use with my laptop for work but upon actually receiving it, I didn't really see myself using it as a daily driver.  I took it apart mainly to re-apply more Krytox 205g0 to the stabs, then proceeded to put the undermentioned Oblivion set on it to put it on my shelf as a display board. *The board itself is a standard KBD67 Lite R2 in smoke black, with l&f'd Durock Amber T1 tactiles. The stabs are screw-in Durock V1/2s(? unsure) lubed with Krytox 205g0, and the spacebar is band-aid/holee modded.* Regarding the set, I'm ideally trying to sell this as a bundle with the Oblivion set and will prioritize offers for both but I'm open to selling them individually if I must.|**~~$200 OBO~~** ~~(board only)~~ SOLD|
|*GMK Oblivion V2, Git Base Kit*|This set is from the original GB that ran back in 2019, and I only got around to opening/using it on a Lin Whale 75 last year. The set has seen some regular use, with expected shine on the alphas & numrow, but as I have contamination OCD and always wash my hands before typing on any of my keyboards, the set has been well-taken care of and IMO the shine does not look uneven/gross at all. You will get the entire base kit as well as some extra modifiers, and they will come in aftermarket trays. Ideally looking to sell this bundled with the KBD67 and will prioritize offers for both but like before, open to selling individually.|**~~$300 OBO~~**~~, or see above~~ SOLD|
|*KBDFans 5° E-White 60%*|I've had this board since May. It's built with a b-stock aluminum E-White 5*°* case from KBDfans and a brass plate, with l&f soldered Gateron Black Ink V2s and lubed (Krytox & Dielectric Grease) /clipped/band-aid modded genuine plate mounted Cherry stabs. There is some cosmetic wear on the edges case and signs of early patina(?) on the brass plate. Keep in mind the switches on this board are north-facing, so while I wouldn't recommend using Cherry keycaps on this board because of switch interference it looks & sounds great nonetheless with other profiles (SA, KAT, MT3, OEM, etc.)|**~~$250 OBO~~** SOLD|

---------------------
Gothic 70:
Built with 205g0 lubed and filmed alpacas, soldered. Springs swapped to Gateron Yellow springs. Stabs are a variety of durock and everglide stabilizers, all holee modded and lubed with 205g0. One of the middle plates has a broken part that I mended with super glue, thankfully you can't see it unless you really focus with the frosted acrylic on top. Tape modded with electrical tape on the back to give it that ""marble-ly"" sound. There is the included foam installed between the pcb and plate. There are aluminum rubber feet installed to give the board some angle.

There are some things that I tried wiring on the back of the board but I think all of it was useless since I think all of the issues came from the humidity in the air messing with the pcb. 

I would love to salvage my spring swapped alpacas but I really can't be bothered de-soldering this entire board anymore.

*Looking for $190 shipped, OBO, for the board within the CONUS*

-------------------------------------
GMK Laser:

I mostly used the gaijin alphas, and I'm pretty sure the cyberdeck alphas are basically untouched. I might've mounted it onto a board once to take some pictures.

These will come shipped in bags since the flimsy original GMK packaging fell apart right when I opened it. There is some slight shine on the keycaps that I rest my hands on(e.g. wasd, spacebar). Scuffed video attempting to show the shine in timestamp album.

*Looking for $170 shipped within CONUS for now. I am not willing to part them either.*

Hello! :)

I am selling some of my keycaps and e-white Think6.5 v2, as I had to slow down with the amount of stuff I've bought.

GMK Kaiju + Novelties - 270 euro - still sealed, never opened / used

The Think6.5 v2 2u is in perfect condition ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/j9f64j2)), I've millmaxed it myself and used it for few days. The plate currently has the corner gaskets attached, with 4 extra new gaskets in the box and 8 of the disassembled ones -> I found this setup optimal as it provides great sound with some flexibility.

Comes with: Millmaxed 2u pcb, plate and case foams, FR4 plate, white weight and badge and original screwdriver.

Price for the Think6.5 v2 - 560 euro  


Both the keycaps and the Think6.5 v2 are being sold basically at cost after shipping, import fees, handling fees + millmaxing.

Shipping of the keycaps is included for EU. Shipping for the Think6.5 v2 - Should be around 20-25 euro with 3 day DHL shipping

Hello, /mm!

I've got some new stuff coming in so it's time to get rid of my older stuff and make some space. Anything in the time stamp not listed below is no longer available.

Prices do include shipping. ***At this time, I will only ship within the United States.***

**I will not ship internationally, and all DMs asking me to do so will be ignored.**
 
No chats, please! Comment before DM.

Haves:

NK65 Aluminum Edition - $230 - Silver case. Built with L&amp;F Moyu Black switches, no keycaps. Comes with case and stock coiled cable. 

~~Ergodox EZ - $130 - this one does not have the lights (shine or otherwise). Comes with tent kit and keycaps pictured. I am missing the X and one of the blank keys. Comes with stock cherry reds. I didn't really use this all that much, I couldn't get used to the layout.~~ sold

~~Infinikey Aether Base - $130 - This set has seen heavy use and is showing some shine, see photos. The spacebar is slightly warped which was common with these sets.~~

~~Infinikey Islander Base and Novelties - $200 - Islander base has seen some decent use, most novelties untouched. See pictures of base. ***I AM NOT SPLITTING THE NOVELTIES.*** DMs asking for just the novelties will be ignored.~~ both IFK sets no longer available 

Ducky Year of the Rat Edition - $500 obo - Price on this is high I'm not sure I want to sell it, but I really don't use it and it sits in its box. Number 1132/2020. Comes with the signed card by Bounce and everything pictured. I did use it for a few weeks - just long enough to decide 60% really is just not for me.

WANTS:

~~A 7V. Please sell me your 7V. Hoping to stay around $800 for the board but please shoot me your offers. If you have an unbuilt unit or even just an unused PCB, that’s even better.~~ purchased

Hey MM,

Today I'm letting go of my grail. This is a beautiful board that I picked up from Novelkeys when the extras ran a few months back. I wouldn't want to get rid of it, but irl needs take priority.

It comes built with L+F Zaku switches on the PC flex plate, so it's quite bouncy and sounds incredible. The PCB has been tape modded and I added polyfill in the case. The result is an incredibly clean and clacky sound. The F row has some L+F Aquakings 67g switches as I ran out of Zakus, but that sounds awesome too.

Asking for **$950 shipped**. Keycaps not included, but we can talk (it's GMK Plum, I just have my corn keycaps on there right now.). Has two slight scuffs on the top left and a very slight scuff on the bottom right .which I'll show in the timestamp and some slight scratches on the stainless steel back, but they're minor and the board is in excellent condition. Never really used it often, but it was in rotation here and there. Comes with an extra aluminum plate. If you have any trades with boards that are within the same range, let me know.

Sound Test for your viewing pleasure :

Anything leaf spring mount

Hi, mechmarket. I have an oddity to sell; 75% gasket mount w/ shiny stainless steel bottom. I used it for a while, it's nice. Pretty heavy. Rotary encoder is convenient, I used it for volume and play/pause. Nothing wrong with it, I just like smaller boards now.

E-white top, steel lower, gasket mount w/ poron strips, rotary encoder, CF plates and fancy clear coat pcb. Has VIA support. PCB had some fitment issues with the spacebar so I widened the holes a little bit. Worked fine after that, but you might want to use the new PCB for Tsangan layouts. I have number 19 of 20.

Finish is fine. Top is clean white, no damage. Bottom is nice and shiny. There's some definitely some light fuzz if you shine a light or view it at an oblique angle though. Comes with two PCBs, two daughterboards, one set kinda used; two CF plates for ANSI and Tsangan layouts; rotary encoder; black encoder wheel; and ships in original box & all.

>[https://streamable.com/61dovq](https://streamable.com/61dovq)  
>  
>Personal opinion--the recording sounds a little bit more ""high  pitched"" than it does in real life. ePBT keycaps also sound somewhat  thinner than GMK or thick PBT sets like Drop Artifact/Hammerworks. YMMV  depending on setup; your build will likely sound a bit deeper and more  clacky than this.

I'm selling three less-expensive keycaps sets I really don't use, and some switches, mainly odd frankenswitches, as well.  I'm always buying new switches and trying new combinations.  I might as well clear out some space and let some things go, if anyone is interested.  Almost everything has been lubed with care and moderation.

I've priced the switches at what I think are fair prices for unlubed switches.  So, properly-lubed switches at that price should be a bargain.  (Wish I could get all those hours spent lubing back!)  I'd just rather clean out some space in my switch bins, rather than stack bins of switches to the ceiling, lol.

# Keycaps:

**JTK Toxic**:  Cherry profile.  Minimal use, no shine.  Sounds deeper and nicer, to me, than GMK.  A little less coverage than GMK Toxic, but a lot cheaper, and will still cover most everything 60% and up.  **$90 shipped OBO.**  Here's the coverage:

[JTK Toxic](https://imgur.com/a/pwydZoz)

**MDA Big Bone Ortho**:  Minimal use, no imperfections.  The thickest keycaps I've seen, probably allowed by the wide profile.  Think I paid around $100 for this, but don't even remember where I got it from anymore.  It came and went, and I can't even find  am image of the kitting on the Net.  **$80 shipped OBO.**    Here's a photo of all the keycaps (there are quite a few), so you can check if it has what you need.

[Big Bone Ortho Photo](https://imgur.com/a/qfxP6Bx)

**Domikey Purple SA**:  Very nice quality, but I can't deal with SA.  A few minutes worth of use.  All kits included, with a lot of coverage, including even split spacebars.  **$80 shipped OBO.**  Here's the kitting, plus a photo of the keyset on my Melody65:

Looking to sell/trade these today, trying to clear up some space.  I'll trade both boards for Alter novelties.

I'm also looking for:

GMK Alter deskmat, sleeve; BNIB preferred. 

GMK Darling

Maybe some Lat artisans but I don't really know what I like yet

Other trades welcome as well but I'm not really looking for more boards at the moment. If you do though I'm only really interested in 60/65%. Sealed keysets are cool too.

Comment before PM, don't use the chat please! Thank you for looking!

Hello, back with another post! It's my birthday tomorrow, and I'm selling items for a special price to help make some other peoples' days a bit better, especially if they're looking to buy keyboard stuff.

Only shipping to USA addresses at the moment. **The only trade offer I'm taking is anything involving WoB R0/R5.** All prices include **USPS Priority Mail** shipping costs unless otherwise stated. Please feel free to offer if it means that these things get out of my hands and into yours.

**KEYCAPS PICTURED ON ANY BOARD I LIST IN THIS POST ARE NOT FOR SALE UNLESS EXPLICITLY STATED OTHERWISE**

I cannot do local meetups for lower prices anymore due to a dramatic change in work schedule. I only have about 2 hours between me waking up for the day and my local post office closing (which also doesn't happen to have one of those self-serve drop-off boxes large enough for keyboard stuff), and that's being generous. Everything will have to be shipped out.

Item|Details|Price|Available
:--|:--|:--|:--
Duck Orion v3 | silver WKL, currently built with 65g MX Clears on stainless steel plate with an h87a PCB. **KEYCAPS NOT INCLUDED.** also includes aluminum full and FR-4 half plate as well as two original PCBs. Case has defects that aren't that visible during normal use. the two original PCBs were soldered/desoldered by previous owner, and all I've done is confirm that they were in the box when I originally bought the board. I can't speak to the quality of the desolder job on either PCB as I haven't looked at them closely. **Price WAY LOWER than what I paid originally**. I'm pretty sure this is under retail value for everything considering that the board is built. | ~~$600 shipped~~ | **SOLD**
o-ring mount Tofu | green case, built with Holy Pandas on aluminum. This is slightly different than any other ""o-ring mount"" Tofu you might see listed because this uses a merro60 PCB, which simply has [large enough holes](https://i.imgur.com/a6zco37.jpeg) to not require removing the standoffs from the Tofu at all. board is dank, but maybe someone else will enjoy this more than me as it's been sitting in a drawer ever since it was built. **NOT SELLING THE PCB ALONE.** Please don't tell me that I can just get a DZ60 to replace it because that'd just require de-soldering the whole thing; that's mildly disrespectful. | ~~$175 shipped~~ | **SOLD**
Raeds x140 | lubed with GS2 and spring-swapped to TX 70g 16mm. These are pretty cool switches but I'm no longer using these in any builds. a large majority (around 100) have been previously soldered and cleanly desoldered using an SS-02. I'm willing to break up into two batches of 70 switches if for some reason you're really not interested in the full lot | $130 shipped for entire quantity, $65 shipped for 70 switches | yes!
Minicom IV WoB alphas | harvested from a Minicom IV TTY device. These have a bit of shine on them, but if you're in the market for these, that shouldn't be a problem at all. Keep in mind that F and J have neither the homing bars nor scoops on them. I'll try to find the 8u spacebar that came with it, but I can't make any guarantees. | $100 shipped or trade+PayPal for WoB R0/R5 | **SALE PENDING**
Pink Haze Bukkakey | by Bad n' Booj. **price is below what I paid retail** | $40 shipped | yes!
Pika Lucky Cat | by Ko Caps. sold as FCFS when originally released. **price is below what I paid retail** | ~~$40 shipped First Class~~ | **SOLD**
Beggy Phuck | by Rejeck Kaps. I'm not sure why I entered for this one, I didn't even get GMK Greg. **price is below what I paid retail** | $40 shipped First Class | yes!

**PLEASE INCLUDE AN OFFER OR SOMETHING WITH YOUR PM IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY MY ASKING PRICE. IT SIMPLY WASTES MY TIME AND YOURS IF YOU ONLY TELL ME THAT YOU WANT THE ITEM.**

Priority for responding to offers will be as follows:

 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing all items for asking price (will give discount for purchasing all items listed here because holy moly that means you have money)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any bundle of either keyboard + artisan for asking price (will give discount accordingly)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing either keyboard for asking price
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any bundle of artisans for asking price (will give discount accordingly)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any one item for asking price

Outside of the listed conditions, I'll check based on when you comment **and** PM. The PM is absolutely necessary for the sale of these items. Since I've had this happen before, if there are two people interested in the same item, but one is willing to pay no questions asked while the other has questions or wants to see more pics, I'm 100% selling to the person who will pay no questions asked. Requests for additional pictures will also take longer than you think, so please consider that when trying to secure an item.

Please understand that if you as a buyer and I agree on a price and you back out of the purchase right after I send the invoice, I will refuse to sell anything to you in the future (yes, that includes if you offer me something like $300 on something that I'm selling for much less). 

 **Do not use the chat function**, I honestly don't know how you are taken to the chat function when the bot's verification post gives you a link to PM sellers. I will ignore you and you won't be in consideration for anything until you send me a PM. I will also ignore you if you do not comment before sending a PM.

If I don't respond, it's likely because I'm just busy doing other things. I will get to all messages accompanying comments in a timely manner. Thanks for checking out the post."

Hello, /mm!

I've got some new stuff coming in so it's time to get rid of my older stuff and make some space.

Prices do include shipping via USPS. FedEx/UPS will be an additional upcharge at buyer's expense. ***At this time, I will only ship within the United States.***

**I will not ship internationally, and all DMs asking me to do so will be ignored.**
 
No chats, please! Comment before DM.

Haves:

~~NK65 Milkshake Edition - $200 - This board was used consistently for about four months. My work bag scuffed the case (see pictures) but the board itself is in excellent condition. Comes stock with the milkshake switches and keycaps.~~ sold

NK65 Aluminum Edition - $230 - Silver case. Built with L&amp;F Moyu Black switches, no keycaps. Comes with case and stock coiled cable. 

Ergodox EZ - $130 - this one does not have the lights (shine or otherwise). Comes with tent kit and keycaps pictured. I am missing the X and one of the blank keys. Comes with stock cherry reds. I didn't really use this all that much, I couldn't get used to the layout.

~~Keychron K8 - $50 - Comes with stock Gateron Red switches. Aluminum case, RGB, but not hotswap. It does not come with keycaps and has seen heavy use.~~ sold

Infinikey Aether Base - $130 - This set has seen heavy use and is showing some shine, see photos. The spacebar is slightly warped which was common with these sets.

Infinikey Islander Base and Novelties - $200 - Islander base has seen some decent use, most novelties untouched. See pictures of base. ***I AM NOT SPLITTING THE NOVELTIES.*** DMs asking for just the novelties will be ignored.

Ducky Year of the Rat Edition - $500 obo - Price on this is high I'm not sure I want to sell it, but I really don't use it and it sits in its box. Number 1132/2020. Comes with the signed card by Bounce and everything pictured. I did use it for a few weeks - just long enough to decide 60% really is just not for me.

WANTS:

Paypal, but I would be open to purchasing the following as well:

~~GMK Frost Witch Base + Novelty Kit~~

I am selling my lightly used prime\_e. It has lubed and filmed glorious pandas, lubed lightly with 205g0 and filmed with tx .15mm clear films. It is also using the pe foam mod. I'm asking for $200 shipped, but can negotiate. Local offers get priority. I can desolder switches if necessary.

Corsair Keycaps, and red leds are salvaged from an old corsair board

Sold--GMK Keyluminatti ships in a bag, purple caps have been mounted, everything else is never used or mounted. --Sold 

Millmax sockets were ordered for the prime\_e board, but I decided against using them. Can either be used as a service, or sold as a set.

Switches:

107x Cherry MX Red, salvaged from an old corsair gaming board, stock and lightly used.

67x Lubed and Filmed Gateron Yellows, broken in and lubed with a mix of silicone oil and silicone grease, comparable to krytox 205g0 and filmed with deskeys films.

80x Random blue switches from a old gaming board, I need to get rid of these they take up too much room.

10x Durock koalas 67g

I can provide more information, or sound test of board if requested.

I will give discounts for bundling items, bundles get priority.

QXP 60 HHKB - Bought on here a while back, it is a gray / blue color and is serial #66. It is built with Kailh Burnt Oranges, Durock Stabs and can be sold with or without the NK Blue & Purple on White Keyset. It is built with an AN-C PCB. There is a tiny anodizing flaw on the corner of the board next to the USB port and some tarnishing on the brass (very common on these). I'm looking to get **$390 with the keycaps or $340 without Shipped**.

KUL87 w/ MX Blacks and a Tai Hao Keyset. I custom painted this as you can see in the photos. It is a color shift purple / green with a design painted on the back (The word bubble is just vinyl but the design is painted on). There are some paint blemishes but overall it is in great condition, please see the photos of the bottom to see what I am referring to. For this keyboard I am looking to get ~~$50 shipped~~ SOLD

I am selling my SM keyboards TKL. It is transparent purple and teal with a copper plate. It has a Hineybush 87a PCB and is finished off with Kailh Box Blacks. It has GMK stabilizers, but keep in mind the spacebar stabilizer should probably be replaced. It works fine but it a bit sluggish and quite noisy currently. The tabs holding the bar in place broke so I had to replace them with a dab of hot glue as pictured. A new stabilizer would fix this issue. If you have any questions feel free to ask. ~~$120 shipped~~ SOLD

The wrist rests were all made by me and are priced as follows:

TKL Teal / Purple Holographic: 14.00"" Excellent condition, no blemish's on the top, some blemishes on the bottom, feet come pre mounted. Looking to get **$30 shipped**

60% Supreme Glitter Blurple: 11.75"" Excellent condition, no blemish's on the top, with some defects and sanded edges on the bottom. Will come with feet that are not attached. Looking to get **$25 shipped**

60% Red Poker: 11.75"" Excellent Condition, no visible blemishes. Will come with feet that are not attached. Looking for **$35 shipped**

~~**KBD19x** - Please read! I purchased this board off MM with the impression that this board did not have any flaws. It was my mistake for not gathering more information prior to making this purchase. This board has one screw hole without any thread at all. The screw was slid in and taped on the board (pic 2 on the timestamp). The PCB works but the only a handful of the LEDs worked. I did my research to try to fix the issues but ultimately gave up and pursued other projects. This board works and can be a fun project to restore. I just don't have the patience for it and will rather take a loss to recover some funds. Comes with silver case, acrylic sandwich layer, solder PCB, and clip on stabs included.

Hello again r/mm

Looking to sell on my bingsu set as it doesn't match up with my e-white board as I imagined.

I spent a small fortune on this set but, I'm not here to extort anyone and would love this set to go to someone who hasn't had the chance of using some gmk before.

[One thing to note is the coloured esc key has some scratches on the side, barely noticeable when in-use but feel wouldn't feel right to not include that information.](https://imgur.com/a/mgIEVsl)

**~~Asking price is £157.50 (including postage fees). Priority going UK -> EU -> Rest of the World~~**

**SOLD FOR ASKING.**

Have a nice day.

Ps. Would trade the set for any Rubrehose BBW if offered."

Prices include CONUS shipping.

~~GMK Nines (scuffed and lightly shined) - 75~~

**Please read and see condition inside photo album first.**

>An unfortunate accident with superglue occurred and some got on this set. See the photo album for caps affected. Most landed on the sides and the few that landed on the top are very small. The largest noticeable blob of glue is on the "" key. The 1.75u rshift is the most messed up cap. I made a bad judgement call and tried to remove the glue on that one using a spoon. I should've at least tried on a less noticeable location first. Set is still pretty usable. If you have a 60/tkl and use the full sized rshift the worst you'll have is the "" key. Other than the scuffed 1.75u rshift the rest should hardly be visible when viewed from a normal typing angle.

~~Holy Gsus x84 + Holy Panda x3 (all lubed) - 94~~

~~Tealios 67g x90 (70 lubed. 20 unlubed) - 60~~

[~~Timestamp~~](https://imgur.com/a/eGRoE6w)

**~~Update:  I have someone who wants to buy the case and keyset, and someone who just wants the keyset.  I know it's only been half-a-day, but, if nobody ends up wanting everything for $500, I'll sell to two people if everything gets sold that way.  So, I'll sell the case and keycaps to someone if I have someone else who wants the plate/PCB/switches/stabs, and I'll sell the keycaps separate from the case and internals if I have buyers for both.  So, if just the PCB/plate/switches stabs assembly interests you, or if just the fully-built KB without the keycaps interests you, PM me and we can work something out.~~**

~~Just bought a Mr. Suit, plus Bingsu on the aftermarket, so I should probably let something go in order to offset some of the money spent.~~

~~For sale is an Aquamarine Klippe, with a Cannonkeys Instant60 PCB, a brass plate, lubed Holy Panda switches, and lubed Durock stabs.  The Aquamarine is darker than I've seen in other photos, but it's actually a great match for GMK Metropolis.  The photo in the timestamp is an accurate representation of how the keycaps match the case.~~

~~The keyboard and keyset have seen moderate use, and it has never been gamed on, just used for typing.  The keyset has a mild amount of shine, but it's evenly distributed, so I haven't even really been aware of it, but examined it before selling and wanted to mention it.  The case is pretty much flawless.~~

~~I'd prefer to try to sell it altogether, since it's a really amazing match.  I'm going to break down my pricing of the individual components, to be transparent, but that doesn't mean I want to part out the pieces.  (I did this once before, and someone really bitched at me because I wouldn't part something out, even though I stated that I was selling altogether).~~

~~Here's the breakdown:  Klippe case $140, Instant60 PCB $45, brass plate $35, lubed (Tribosys 3204) holy pandas $45, Durock stabs $10, Metropolis $215.~~

~~That's $230 for the case, PCB, brass plate, and stabs.  $45 for nicely-lubed switches.  $215 for the keyset.~~

~~That comes out to $490, and shipping will probably be $20 to $25 I suppose.  I'll cover most of the shipping and sell everything for~~ **~~$500 shipped~~**~~.  I think that's pretty fair.~~

~~There's also some shelf-liner underneath the PCB.~~

~~Also, Metropolis comes with the extra little kit that was added to the base kit, so it has some extra keycaps that you don't get in the R2 base, like cyan arrow keys.~~

~~CONUS only, please.  Any questions, just ask.~~

~~Comment before PM, please~~"

Hi Mechmarket, I have some stuff that I want to either sell straight out or potentially trade for other stuff, mainly looking for non gasket mount boards since I’m quite bored with gasket mount at the moment. Prices are all OBO and including shipping to NA as always and can be changed if deemed out of line. Mainly looking for sales/trade in NA.

2. Jis Hhkb (rails are slightly lube by me following Taeha’s vods, didn’t really get into topres so letting it go) asking for $150
3. HHKB Pro 2 controller (Bought it from another user here and it works but only if you are using an hhkb pro 2, i borrowed my friend’s pro 2 to confirm that it does. Compatible with VIA). Asking for $40 but can be bundled with the Jis
4. Gmk Godspeed Columbia (Base + Novelties. Decided to keep Belafonte instead so selling this one, barely used by me for an hour while typing emails) Asking for $170 shipped.

Mainly looking for top mount boards and no lower than a 60% but feel free to pm me about anything that you are willing to trade.

Looking to sell/trade these two boards and the SA Mizu keyset. I haven't done anything with them other than open to check contents.

Willing to trade these boards for other things as well. I'm currently looking for:

GMK Alter Novelties, deskmat, sleeve; BNIB preferred. Will trade the Space65 for the novelties set if you have BNIB

GMK Olivia Light base; BNIB, minimal use preferred

ePBT Kon Momo

Maybe some Lat artisans but I don't really know what I like yet

Other trades welcome as well but I'm not really looking for more boards at the moment. If you do though I'm only really interested in 60/65% at the moment. Sealed keysets are cool too.

Hey MM,

Today I'm letting go of my grail. This is a beautiful board that I picked up from Novelkeys when the extras ran a few months back. I wouldn't want to get rid of it, but irl needs take priority.

It comes built with L+F Zaku switches on the PC flex plate, so it's quite bouncy and sounds incredible. The PCB has been tape modded and I added polyfill in the case. The result is an incredibly clean and clacky sound. The F row has some L+F Aquakings 67g switches as I ran out of Zakus, but that sounds awesome too.

Asking for **$950 shipped**. Keycaps not included, but we can talk (it's GMK Plum). Has two slight scuffs on the top left which I'll show in the timestamp and some slight scratches on the stainless steel back, but they're minor and the board is in excellent condition. Never really used it often, but it was in rotation here and there. Comes with an extra aluminum plate. If you have any trades with boards that are within the same range, let me know.

Sound Test for your viewing pleasure :

Keycaps are basically new. Only touched to put onto a keyboard one time as well as to put into the JTK trays. Decided to remove the keycaps after looking at it on the board and went with JTK Vostok instead. Never opened or used any of the Novelties.

Desk Mat was used for a few days. Looks almost new.

**SOLD** **~~Ramaworks U80-A Seq 1~~** ~~- Milk, hotswap: Purchased a few months back from another user on~~ r/mm ~~and used as a daily for about a week. Case is in excellent condition - has one small scuff on the right side that I've tried to capture in the album. This is a scuff on the finish and can't be cleaned/wiped off/etc. The weight and plate show some light scratches - the plate more smudged from hot swapping/stab tuning - but nothing major or visible when built. Comes built with tuned Everglide stabs, moon weight, PCB+plate, mute mount, Rama internal dampener, and original Rama box. No other accessories included.~~

**SOLD** **~~ai03 Vega~~** ~~- E-white, millmaxed for hotswap: Board is in overall almost perfect cosmetic condition, just some fingerprint smudges on the weight (which is almost unavoidable.) PCB has been millmaxed with 7305 sockets for standard caps, split backspace, and tsangan 7U spacebar/bottom row and comes built with tuned Durock v2 stabs, extra gaskets (gaskets are installed on case) and hardware, and a KBDfans case (no original box). Only issue is that two of the case screws on the right side have been stripped. I tried wrapping some plumbers tape around to get the threads to take and while they didn't bite, they've stayed in place and there is no effect on the final build. Feel free to PM me with any specific questions. I previously had this board built with blue velvets and the sound was :chefs-kiss:~~

**~~Ramaworks Kara Seq 1~~** ~~- Iced: BNIB from Seq 1. Comes with original boxes and all original accessories.~~

**KAT BOW:** Purchased directly from Divinikey, mounted once and typed lightly on for about a week. No signs of wear. Ships in original box.

Hello! :)

I am selling some of my keycaps and e-white Think6.5 v2, as I had to slow down with the amount of stuff I've bought. All of the listed keycaps are still sealed, brand new in box, never used.

GMK Kaiju + Novelties - 270 euro

~~GMK Hennessey - 170 euro~~ \- sold

The keycaps are basically at cost now after VAT + handling fees + shipping so I won't really go lower.

The Think6.5 v2 2u is in perfect condition ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/j9f64j2)), I've millmaxed it myself and used it for few days. The plate currently has the corner gaskets attached, with 4 extra new gaskets in the box and 8 of the disassembled ones -> I found this setup optimal as it provides great sound with some flexibility.

Comes with: Millmaxed 2u pcb, plate and case foams, FR4 plate, white weight and badge and original screwdriver.

Price for the Think6.5 v2 - 560 euro

Shipping of the keycaps is included for EU. Shipping for the Think6.5 v2 - Should be around 20-25 euro with 3 day DHL shipping

Feel free to ask any questions and please post a comment with 'pm' before sending a private message. Please do not use chat - you can just click the 'Send user a PM' from a comment by the mechmarket bot :)

Hey r/mechmarket I've got some things I'm looking to sell today.

At this point I am **not** looking to split the botanical base kit and the spacebars. both kits have been used for less than an hour, mounted them on a board and then wasn't crazy about how they looked. Will ship in bag.

I would also heavily prefer conus only. Shipping for artisans is $5 and shipping for GMK set is $10.

Could not find any shine on any the keycaps and if there is, it is very minimal. Also have the pink and beige rubber Rama caps.|$340 shipped or trade for  GMK Frost Witch|
|KAT Artic|Bought from NovelKeys. Used for about 2 weeks. No shine. Only used the alphas and mods. Spacebars are still BNIB.|$180 shipped or trade for GMK  Frost Witch + Paypal|

Hey MM!

I'm clearing out some space for new GBs and boards. Please read carefully and feel free to reach out with any specific questions or photo requests.

**~~Ramaworks U80-A~~** ~~- Milk, hotswap: Purchased a few months back from another user on~~ r/mm ~~and used as a daily for about a week. Case is in excellent condition - has one small scuff on the right side that I've tried to capture in the album. This is a scuff on the finish and can't be cleaned/wiped off/etc. The weight and plate show some light scratches - the plate more smudged from hot swapping/stab tuning - but nothing major or visible when built. Comes built with tuned Everglide stabs, weight, PCB+plate, mute mount, Rama internal dampener, and original Rama box. No other accessories included.~~

TRADED **~~Eniigma Vertigo~~** ~~- Byzantine Purple/E-White, solder: Dropping the price a little bit -~~ [~~see my previous post for more details~~](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/pmyx4z/usca_h_eniigma_vertigo_byzantine_purpleewhite/)~~. Essentially 2 of the 4 included PCBs (including the built PCB) have broken diodes that can be fixed if hotwired. The other 2 PCBs have been tested and are fully functional. Includes 4 total PCBs (2 fully functional, 2 with broken diodes), full alu plate, and a build on alu half plate with stem swapped milky yellows. Again,~~ [~~see my previous post for full details~~](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/pmyx4z/usca_h_eniigma_vertigo_byzantine_purpleewhite/)~~. Comes with original Eniigma case.~~

~~PENDING~~ **~~Ramaworks Kara Seq 1~~** ~~- Iced: BNIB from Seq 1. Comes with original boxes and all original accessories.~~

SOLD FOR ASKING **~~KAT 9009:~~** ~~Purchased directly from KBDfans, mounted once and type on for less than an hour. Comes with full kit including spacebars. Ships in original boxes.~~

**KAT BOW:** Purchased directly from Divinikey, mounted once and typed lightly on for about a week. No signs of wear. Ships in original box.

**WASD Code TKL** \- Black: Beater board with Cherry MX Clears

I'm not gonna lie keyboard people, I have no clue why some seem to be selling for $800 and this one sold for $360 but I would love to pay like $300-400 for a keyboard. I love the Tofu but I think I would rather have a slightly more expensive keyboard to hopefully stave me from wanting other ~$150-200 keyboards. I would love an ID80 v2 or a ID80 Crystal, not the smokey variant. I meant to put this in my title but I'm running low on brain fuel.

[Timestamps](https://imgur.com/a/rTY3gc7)

[August 5 Timestamps, I ended up getting too distracted to make a post.](https://imgur.com/a/GcqgVVc)

* **Tofu 65:** Gateron Black Inks v2 (lubed + filmed), Polycarbonate plate, KBD67 rev2 PCB, C3 N9 Grey stabilizers. Can include Bento clones for $30. The Tofu65 is the keyboard with the GMK Laser key caps in the timestamp. **$210 Shipped**


* **Tofu 60:** The keyboard is in excellent conditions and I can't see any cosmetic defects, dents, scratches or cracks in the casing. The keyboard sounds great to me and I really love it but I found myself really missing arrow keys and got a Tofu65. | DZ60RGB v2 Hotswap, PC Plate & Foam Has 205g0 + 105 on Spring Lubed Black Inks + Durock v2 205g0 Lubed Stabs Pictured keycaps are also included, they were like $28 on Amazon - nothing fancy but I actually like them. They also sound much better than the GMK Lasers and Infinikey BoW key caps. Has one Glorious Panda switch, stock and unlubed. **$250 Shipped**

* **NK65 Clear NK65 EE Clear | Gateron Aliaz Silent | Infinikey BoW Keycaps** [Original Seller's Description]: I have a love/hate relationship with the NK65. I think its a great price and feels good, but I've used multiple versions of it and it has a lot of problems. For this board in particular, the top right mounting post has cracked and been removed. There is a cracked plate mounting point in top right (~~[~~see image~~](https://i.imgur.com/lAKKCqd.jpg)~~). The ESC key hotswap socket popped off and I had to re-solder it myself and I added some hot glue to further reinforce it. There are also some small scratches on the plate from the switch puller; these can't be seen when switches are in the keyboard. 

I built this board to get close to my beloved HHKB. But it's still an MX board so it's more like typing on a tactile keyboard while someone yells *Topre!* from another room. Here is a [**sound test**](https://youtu.be/fFwWND8tQYY). I still love the way it sounds/feels. Adhesive foam has been added to the underside of the plate, and the stock stabs have been modded with dialectric grease and electric tape. The Aliaz switches have been lightly lubed with 3204, the ones that had bad housing wobble have been filmed (so not all of them), and those terrible springs have been swapped with 60g springs from retired Cherry blues. Note: the spacebar switch has a 70g spring. I don't really recommend taking this keyboard apart, it's good to go right out of the box.**$150 Shipped**

* **Blue Coiled Cable**: I'm not sure what material this is but it isn't techflex or paracord. It feels smooth and I absolutely love how vivid the blue color is but I bought this coiled cable and now I'm just rolling with it I guess. Plus if I ever get a macropad I would probably need a matching white cable and I feel like finding a white cable should be extremely easy. **$30 Shipped or $20 w/ Keyboard**

Free Cool Gray 65% Keebmat with keyboard purchase. It's like new and has never actually been used. It's a bit longer than my 65% keyboard and I didn't really like how it looked.

I would absolutely love a macropad since I got my first artisans from Blue Bomber Fox and I love them. I desperately want a macropad that can fit 5 to 8 artisans with a rotary encoder. There was also a really cool looking acrylic macropad (or maybe it was a numpad that could be configured to be a macropad) that had a slider and a rotary encoder but I can't remember what it's called, hopefully somebody knows."

For sale is this MGA Standard bundle complete with a backup pcb and other accessories. Due to unexpected expenses, I will be dropping the price to help get this sold. 


Ancient Curse DMG is trade only — see below. 


*WTS — CONUS ONLY:*


1. A-Stock Silver MGA Standard Bundle — **~~$390~~ ~~$380 shipped~~**


FULL BUNDLE: **$350 SHIPPED**


1X PCB + 1X PLATE: **$290 SHIPPED**


BUNDLE INCLUDES:


 - 1x A-Stock silver case (USB-C) (no marks or ano imperfections) 


 - 2x Sneakbox hotswap USB-C PCBs


 - 1x Silver Sneakbox knob + encoder


 - 1x Black GMMK Pro knob


 - 1x Sneakbox POM plate


 - 1x Sneakbox FR4 plate


 - 1x set of case/PCB foam


 - All hardware including all screws, unsoldered LEDs, and a set of 7305 sockets for split backspace/rshift positions


 - Optional: Brass plate — +$35


This board and all the accessories were purchased new during the in-stock summer sale and used in my weekly rotation until about a week ago. 


Please see album for photos of condition and pcb tests. From what I can see, the case has no marks aside from some slight dirt in a couple of the screw holes. The FR4 and POM plates both have typical minor scratches from pulling switches. 

Both pcbs were tested with switches in to confirm the sockets are functioning. Switches were placed into both caps lock positions and tweezers were used to test the unsoldered split backspace and rshift. 

Will also include 16x 7305 millmax sockets free of charge for filling out the split positions on both pcbs. 

PM is open for any questions!

Hey MM!

I'm clearing out some space for new GBs and boards. Please read carefully and feel free to reach out with any specific questions or photo requests.

**~~Ramaworks U80-A~~** ~~- Milk, hotswap: Purchased a few months back from another user on~~ r/mm ~~and used as a daily for about a week. Case is in excellent condition - has one small scuff on the right side that I've tried to capture in the album. This is a scuff on the finish and can't be cleaned/wiped off/etc. The weight and plate show some light scratches - the plate more smudged from hot swapping/stab tuning - but nothing major or visible when built. Comes built with tuned Everglide stabs, weight, PCB+plate, mute mount, Rama internal dampener, and original Rama box. No other accessories included.~~

SOLD FOR ASKING **~~Owlab Jelly Epoch~~** ~~- Dewdrop, hotswap: BNIB. Ended up trading around for a Jelly SE and abandoned plans for this dewdrop build. Comes with: hotswap PCB, PC plate, all foams/gaskets/hardware, original box. All unused/unopened (except for photos.)~~

TRADED **~~Eniigma Vertigo~~** ~~- Byzantine Purple/E-White, solder: Dropping the price a little bit -~~ [~~see my previous post for more details~~](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/pmyx4z/usca_h_eniigma_vertigo_byzantine_purpleewhite/)~~. Essentially 2 of the 4 included PCBs (including the built PCB) have broken diodes that can be fixed if hotwired. The other 2 PCBs have been tested and are fully functional. Includes 4 total PCBs (2 fully functional, 2 with broken diodes), full alu plate, and a build on alu half plate with stem swapped milky yellows. Again,~~ [~~see my previous post for full details~~](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/pmyx4z/usca_h_eniigma_vertigo_byzantine_purpleewhite/)~~. Comes with original Eniigma case.~~

SOLD FOR ASKING **~~Fox Labs Key 65~~** ~~- E-white/cyan/polycarbonate, millmaxed: Really great looking and sounding combo: e-white aluminum case, cyan aluminum plate and weight, polycarbonate bottom. Includes a millmaxed PCB for hot swap and an extra white aluminum plate. Doesn't have underglow however a strip has been placed on the back of the PCB to prevent the reset switch from being pressed when assembled. Comes with tuned C3 stabs, extra white alu plate and original box.~~

**~~Ramaworks Kara Seq 1~~** ~~- Iced: BNIB from Seq 1. Comes with original boxes and all original accessories.~~

SOLD FOR ASKING **~~ePBT Kon Momo~~**~~: Purchased used from another user on~~ r/mm ~~but decided the colors weren't for me. All kits in overall great. shape with no noticeable signs of wear. Includes: Base Kit + Icon + Arrow + NOMAD + Numpad + Anti-Color-Addon + Short Bar 3Ships with base in original box and other kits in bags.~~

SOLD FOR ASKING **~~KAT 9009:~~** ~~Purchased directly from KBDfans, mounted once and type on for less than an hour. Comes with full kit including spacebars. Ships in original boxes.~~

**KAT BOW:** Purchased directly from Divinikey, mounted once and typed lightly on for about a week. No signs of wear. Ships in original box.

Hello! I am letting go of this absolute gem of a Topre build because I am no longer interested in Topre boards and I am looking to downsize my collection. I am willing to sell it without keycaps. Prices are negotiable. You can shoot me a lower offer and you might get lucky :)

**I am also considering TRADES for other high end 60% boards + Paypal on your or my side, GMK keycap sets + Paypal, etc.**

**All prices are OBO and include Paypal fees (willing to consider lower offers).**

\- **Motorsport Yellow Heavy-6 Topre build - 900 USD + shipping OBO**

* Leopold FC660C Low Noise Edition (silenced purple sliders)
* HASU Controller (Flashed with VIA, QMK compatible)
* Norbauer Heavy-6 Motorsport Yellow housing with powder coat textured finish
* Fully lubed with Tribosys 3203 (rails) and Krytox 205g0 (stabs)
* Novatouch sliders and stabilizers (except the spacebar which uses the original purple silenced Topre stems). It uses the silencing rings on every slider :)
* Will also throw in a custom coiled yellow mini USB cable made by Tokas Cable Works.
* Will ship it properly protected inside a TX bag (included) with the original packaging from Norbauer, leftover BKE domes, Novatouch sliders, original domes, original plastic case, original controller, keycaps and every other Topre related leftovers that I might have (PBT spacebars, etc). Comes with its own Leopold Mini-USB cable as well.

**- GMK Spirit base kit - 210 USD OBO + shipping**: Minimal to no shine. Will ship properly protected in zip bags, I do not have the original packaging for it.

**Get the whole bundle for 1100 USD + shipping (OBO, negotiable)**

I can sell the Heavy-6 build without the keycaps, should you want to, but bundle sales and EU buyers will be prefered. **I can ship these items worldwide.** **Again, all prices are negotiable (OBO), I will entertain lower offers.** Please comment in here before PMing.

Hey all!

The last time I ordered GMK color rings for myself and friends I had extras and a tonnnn of people wanted to get one, so I've reordered a handful to save on shipping for those in CONUS.

## GMK Color Rings:
- ~~15~~ available, sorry all! I'll see about getting more Color Rings in bulk for y'all
- $32 shipped CONUS
  - Buying one with shipping from Uniqey is around 41 Euros
- Max 2 per person

Comment before PMing, thanks!

Hereby I'm selling my last board that I build recently its about 2 months old and in basically new state. I build it for a lightweight board to take to work but I just find myself not using it at all. I would highly prefer selling it as a full build so that will have priority its not FCFS. For the build its build with C3 Equalz stabs which have been lubed by me with krytox G205, Its build with stock Gazzew Bobagum silent Linear's (52g) Comes with 10 extra switches. It also has some Korea keycaps from kbdfans on it. The board comes with all the original boxes/accesories even the original packages for the PCB etc etc. Im selling the full build including fees but not including shipping for 310,00 (I again highly prefer selling as a whole build)

The deskmat is in good shape used for about a month cleaned weekly (with a cleaning towel) comes in original packaging I'm selling it for 35,00 excluding shipping but including fees.

Price include Paypal fees but do not include shipping.

* Edit 9/22 * If you sent me a PM and I never replied, send me another if you don't mind. A few got lost in the mix of the flood of PMs I got.

I still have plenty of 1987 cases and color options if you PM me anything you're looking for. Thanks to everyone who bought something, it's nice to clean out some of my storage space. The website will be opening up again soon, so keep an eye on it if the designs interest you.

* Edit 9/21 * If you’re one of the three custom prints (translucent 1987, translucent 1984, or minivan case) I’ve got those prepared soon. Printer is running this week and should be done by the weekend. Translucent ones came out extra nice!


*Edit 9/17 * 90% of packages got shipped out. Some of the cases are shipping tomorrow, I need to make sure I don't rush the brass heat inserts and get them crooked. I'll add some extra cases to those orders to make up for the delay. For the custom colors and Minivan custom case (clear mostly) - I'm getting those done this weekend and those are planned for shipping Monday the 20th.

Sorry about any sort of delays, I'm going to slowly turn some of the shipping over to another employee once I reopen the shop, so shipping should be faster. I'm trying to stick to 72 hour turnaround times, but this week has been a bit busy, so four or five days has been the current average.

*Edit 9/16* Update: Wow, thanks for all the messages, I meant to get everything shipped today, but Paypal's shipping label system is down still - so I'm converting the labels into Shopify to print. Packages will be dropped off tomorrow during my lunch break.

I'll add some switch sample packs to each package since they're a bit late shipping.

If you have a custom print ordered, I should have those all caught up by this weekend for shipping on Monday. Thanks to everyone for the interest in custom prints.

Also, I still have a few items left and several 1987 cases and KBD67 kits, if anyone is interested in those. Thanks!!

**Used Matrix Keycaps: Reverse Retrowave - PMO:** Bought them and used them a little bit on my first keyboard a while back, but then took them off and let them collect dust for months and months. Idk what they're worth but they're $45 new.

# Other options

~~I also have 21 stock Holy Pandas, not really wanting to sell to someone because shipping would be like half the cost so if you buy something else and want these, probably like $10 for them.~~ **Sold**"

Hey! looking to make a couple of trades. 

1. first I have GMK laser blocknet and gajin which I want to trade for the normal cyberdeck since I'm not a fan of the hiragana sub legends and mitocons. 
2. have GMK Bushido which I want to trade for simple GMK Wob

Both sets are basically new and have no shine, not looking to sell just trades. Let me know if you have anything! CONUS only

For sale is this MGA Standard bundle complete with a backup pcb and other accessories. Ancient Curse DMG is trade only — see below. 


*WTS — CONUS ONLY:*


1. A-Stock Silver MGA Standard Bundle — **~~$390~~ $380 shipped**

This board and all the accessories were purchased new during the in-stock summer sale and used in my weekly rotation until about a week ago. 


BUNDLE INCLUDES:


 - 1x A-Stock silver case (USB-C) (no marks or ano imperfections) 


 - 2x Sneakbox hotswap USB-C PCBs


 - 1x Silver Sneakbox knob + encoder


 - 1x Black GMMK Pro knob


 - 1x Sneakbox POM plate


 - 1x Sneakbox FR4 plate


 - 1x set of case/PCB foam


 - All hardware including all screws, unsoldered LEDs, and a set of 7305 sockets for split backspace/rshift positions


 - Optional: Brass plate — +$35


Please see album for photos of condition and pcb tests. From what I can see, the case has no marks aside from some slight dirt in a couple of the screw holes. The FR4 and POM plates both have typical minor scratches from pulling switches. 

Both pcbs were tested with switches in to confirm the sockets are functioning. Switches were placed into both caps lock positions and tweezers were used to test the unsoldered split backspace and rshift. 

Will also include 16x 7305 millmax sockets free of charge for filling out the split positions on both pcbs. 

PM is open for any questions!

~~Hey MM!~~

**~~PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!!~~**

~~I recently purchased this Vertigo from another~~ r/mm ~~user who didn't disclose that both included PCBs were broken (1 missing diode on each, see details below.) Afterwards I acquired 2 additional tested and functioning PCBs to work on a new build but have since acquired other boards (and moved a bit away from WKL) and put this on the way way back burner. The 2 brand new PCBs are tested and ready to go, otherwise you could look into quick fixes for the missing diodes (others have tried various fixes and have been successful.) Either way, you'll have enough to get your build going and then some!~~

~~Aside from the original PCB issues, the board itself is virtually flawless - no major finishing issues from what I can tell (I can provide detailed photos on request).~~

~~Details:~~ **~~Eniigma Vertigo - Byzantine Purple/E-White~~**

~~Includes:~~ **~~4 total PCBs,~~** **~~2 extra daughterboards, and full aluminum plate:~~**

* ~~2 brand new and tested functional~~
* ~~1 new with a missing diode (~~
* ~~1 built with Gateron Milky Yellows (Lubed & Filmed) that are stem swapped with UHMWPE stems on  aluminum half plate -~~ **~~LEFT ALT KEY DIODE IS BROKEN AND MISSING~~**~~. The rest of the PCB functions normally.~~

~~Will come with built PCB installed and in the original Eniigma case.~~

~~Preference is US > CAN > INTL~~

**~~Trades Interests:~~** ~~Non-Drop GMK Sets (add PP on either side)~~

~~Let me know if you have any questions or would like any other photos.~~

~~Please comment before PM'ing and no chat!~~

Hi all,

I’m selling the excess keyboards and keycap sets, starting off with the following items:

* Drop Alt, low profile, in Space Grey. Barely used. Stock keycaps in perfect condition. 65g Halo Clear switches with the exception of 62g Zilents on WASD keys. Original rattly stabs replaced with NovelKeys ones (I think) (not lubed). Will ship in the original box with the original cable. *DOES NOT* include the keycap and switch pullers - no longer have them. Will include a Drop carry case to compensate. Only sign of wear - scratches on the plate from the switch puller, invisible with switches in place.
* ~~GMK Apollo keycap set + spacebars kit. Never taken out from the box. Factory seal broken only to inspect content. The tray itself is slightly cracked - got it this way.~~ (sold)
* ~~GMK White on Black (Drop). Barely used, has no signs of wear.~~ (sold)

Prices are negotiable.

Hello! I am letting go of this absolute gem of a Topre build because I am no longer interested in Topre boards and I am looking to downsize my collection. I am willing to sell it without keycaps. Prices are negotiable. You can shoot me a lower offer and you might get lucky :)

**All prices are OBO and include Paypal fees (willing to consider lower offers).**

\- **Motorsport Yellow Heavy-6 Topre build - 900 USD + shipping OBO**

* Leopold FC660C Low Noise Edition (silenced purple sliders)
* HASU Controller (Flashed with VIA, QMK compatible)
* Norbauer Heavy-6 Motorsport Yellow housing with powder coat textured finish
* Fully lubed with Tribosys 3203 (rails) and Krytox 205g0 (stabs)
* Novatouch sliders and stabilizers (except the spacebar which uses the original purple silenced Topre stems). It uses the silencing rings on every slider :)
* Will also throw in a custom coiled yellow mini USB cable made by Tokas Cable Works.
* Will ship it properly protected inside a TX bag (included) with the original packaging from Norbauer, leftover BKE domes, Novatouch sliders, original domes, original plastic case, original controller, keycaps and every other Topre related leftovers that I might have (PBT spacebars, etc). Comes with its own Leopold Mini-USB cable as well.

**- GMK Spirit base kit - 210 USD OBO + shipping**: Minimal to no shine. Will ship properly protected in zip bags, I do not have the original packaging for it.

**Get the whole bundle for 1100 USD + shipping (OBO, negotiable)**

I can sell the Heavy-6 build without the keycaps, should you want to, but bundle sales and EU buyers will be prefered. **I can ship these items worldwide.** **Again, all prices are negotiable (OBO), I will entertain lower offers.** Please comment in here before PMing. Do not send me chat messages, please. Thank you."

Hello, this is my 2nd post so bear with me. I'm looking to exit the hobby to fund my photography addiction, so I'm hoping to liquidate this all. Note I will be as transparent as possible and am flexible on price. I am not looking to trade only for cash. **Note that I am also losing a shit ton of money on these items so I'm not running away like a bandit, so please understand.**

Infinitum TKL WKL B Stock (550USD shipped) (Does not come with switches/keycaps) -- **SOLD**

* There are noticeable scratches under direct light stretching across the entire weight. I am sure you can get this polished with a polishing cloth, but I personally do not want to attempt. It shouldn't be too difficult however if you get one of those polishing clothes from amazon.
* Hook marks under the F1/F2. They are quite hard to see but they are there and is probably a major turn off for most.
* Built with Durock V2 stabs lubed with Krytox 205g0, includes a Keycult TKL millmaxed with 3305.
* Comes with new PCB from Eniigma (opened just to check whether if diodes were soldered properly)
* Built with CF plate
* Comes with original Alu plate.
* Comes with original carrying case.

RAMA M60A Olivia (550 shipped) (Does not come with switches/keycaps) -- **SOLD**

* Backweight is pristine and really beautiful. Hard to photograph even with my camera because it simply shows the reflection as per the photos.
* Comes with durock stabs (I believe) pre lubed.
* Comes with original box but nothing else.

GMK Olivia -- **No longer being sold.**

* These keycaps have been used and abused like a beast, so there is no more top layer on the plastic. It is extremely shiny and feels like you're rubbing against plastic on your fingers, not the ribbed texture you get with every new abs set.
* I'm looking to get 250$ CAD for these. If you buy this with the m60a olivia i'll give a discount for both together.

Let me know if you have any questions."

EDIT: EVERYTHING HAS SOLD!!! Thanks so much to everyone who inquired :)

Hey Everyone, I'm selling a couple things today to make some money for college :D

1. ~~Switch Couture Alice~~ (Sold)- $250 - I am the original owner of this board and have only used it a few times! It comes built with 67g Koala switches that have been lubed and filmed with Krytox 205g+Deskeys films! The PCB is a Sneakbox design hot-swap PCB! The stabs are lubed Durock V2s that are balanced and sound great! It also comes with a Sneakbox Design Wrist rest. All parts are in mint condition and the cost of everything was 265$ but since I want to get rid of it ASAP to pay for college I am selling at a loss :P (I would prefer to sell this all together but if you would like to buy the switches for 65$ you can)
2. ~~GMK WoB~~ (Sold) - $110 - Bought a few months back and didn't like the look on the board so I am looking to sell them for what I bought them for :-) Absolutely no shine and comes shipped with the tray!
3. ~~Purple Kaizen Titanium Artisan~~ (Sold) - $50 - This was a limited run of only 72 made. Mine is number 22/72 and the bottom is engraved to prove it! My photos don't do its stunning oil slick purple color justice, so if you want a more accurate representation click [here](https://divinestudios.store/products/purple-kaizen-titanium-keycap)! I feel like this artisan would be an amazing fit for the majority of keycaps sets but would look especially good on GMK Vaporwave and GMK Striker :)

I would like to stay CONUS with shipping. If by chance you're local (02540), I'll meet up to deliver it. If you have any interest or questions, please [PM me.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Marcus_Neistat)

Looking to sell these puppies to fund a basement garage. Not really super up to date on prices so if I'm super off base feel free to make a reasonable offer. Worse thing I say is no.

Canadian buyers preferred. Shipping not included. Open to negotiation, especially if buying more then one board. Open to trades, but actively pursuing cash."

Hello, back with another post! Got some bills to pay, so I have to let some things go. I normally would strike through product descriptions, but I will leave them up to help guide those who are looking to purchase any of the items listed below. 

Only shipping to USA addresses at the moment. **CURRENTLY NOT TAKING ANY TRADE OFFERS.** All prices include **USPS Priority Mail** shipping costs. Please feel free to offer if it means that these things get out of my hands and into yours.

**KEYCAPS PICTURED ON ANY BOARD I LIST IN THIS POST ARE NOT FOR SALE UNLESS EXPLICITLY STATED OTHERWISE**

I cannot do local meetups for lower prices anymore due to a dramatic change in work schedule. Everything will have to be shipped out.

Item|Details|Price|Available
:--|:--|:--|:--
Duck Orion v3 | silver WKL, currently built with 65g MX Clears on stainless steel plate with an h87a PCB. **KEYCAPS NOT INCLUDED.** also includes aluminum full and FR-4 half plate as well as two original PCBs. Case has defects that aren't that visible during normal use. the two original PCBs were soldered/desoldered by previous owner, and all I've done is confirm that they were in the box when I originally bought the board. I can't speak to the quality of the desolder job on either PCB as I haven't looked at them closely. **Price is less than what I paid originally**. | $675 shipped | yes!
smoke PC TMO50v2 | smoky PC case with PCB cleanly de-soldered using an FR-301. yes, this board ran recently but smoke PC didn't make a return as a color. great board, but honestly it's just been sitting on a shelf for the past few months with little to no use. weight has a few spots of patina/tarnish/whatever you want to call it. comes with Cannonkeys carrying case. **If you make an offer for this board, there's a 98% chance I'll accept it.** I need this thing gone and into a better home. | $475 shipped | yes!
o-ring mount Tofu | green case, built with Holy Pandas on aluminum. This is slightly different than any other ""o-ring mount"" Tofu you might see listed because this uses a merro60 PCB, which simply has [large enough holes](https://i.imgur.com/a6zco37.jpeg) to not require removing the standoffs from the Tofu at all. board is dank, but maybe someone else will enjoy this more than me as it's been sitting in a drawer ever since it was built. | $200 shipped | yes!
Raeds x140 | lubed with GS2 and spring-swapped to TX 70g 16mm. These are pretty cool switches but I'm no longer using these in any builds. a large majority (around 100) have been previously soldered and cleanly desoldered using an SS-02. **I will not be breaking up this quantity unless I can somehow get two buyers to ask for quantities that add up to 140, and I'll be ignoring any PMs that clearly show that you didn't read this part.** If you really want a different quantity, make a friend or two and split the cost with them after buying. | $160 shipped | yes!
black/purple aviator cable | received this as part of a trade, but I have no use for it as I already have a custom cable. coil is on device side, and connector is USB-mini. buy something else from this list, and you get this for free. | $30 shipped, **free with purchase of any other item** | yes!
1800-sized wooden wrist rest | received this as part of a trade, but I have no use for it since I float my wrists while typing. It's a little bit bigger than TKL and fits 1800 the best. If you got a rekt1800 somewhat recently, this might be interesting to you. Check the timestamp album for a picture of with with my Aegis (nothing on the Aegis is considered for sale so please don't ask). The wrist-rest has some material on the underside of it to help it stay in place. If you buy this, please please please consider buying something else since I'll need to go out of my way to buy a big enough box to fit it. | $30 shipped | yes!
Pink Haze Bukkakey | by Bad n' Booj. **price is below what I paid retail** | $50 shipped | yes!
Magenta Crayons Eggface v2 | by ETF/Nightcaps. part of the 420 sale this year. **price is below what I paid retail** | $50 shipped First Class | yes
Pika Lucky Cat | by Ko Caps. sold as FCFS when originally released. **price is below what I paid retail** | $50 shipped First Class | yes!
Beggy Phuck | by Rejeck Kaps. I'm not sure why I entered for this one, I didn't even get GMK Greg. **price is below what I paid retail** | $50 shipped First Class | yes!

**PLEASE INCLUDE AN OFFER OR SOMETHING WITH YOUR PM IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY MY ASKING PRICE. IT SIMPLY WASTES MY TIME AND YOURS IF YOU ONLY TELL ME THAT YOU WANT THE ITEM.**

Priority for responding to offers will be as follows:

 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing all items for asking price (will give discount for purchasing all items listed here because holy moly that means you have money)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any bundle of either keyboard + artisan for asking price (will give discount accordingly)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing either keyboard for asking price
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any bundle of artisans for asking price (will give discount accordingly)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any one item for asking price

Outside of the listed conditions, I'll check based on when you comment **and** PM. The PM is absolutely necessary for the sale of these items. Since I've had this happen before, if there are two people interested in the same item, but one is willing to pay no questions asked while the other has questions or wants to see more pics, I'm 100% selling to the person who will pay no questions asked. Requests for additional pictures will also take longer than you think, so please consider that when trying to secure an item.

Please understand that if you as a buyer and I agree on a price and you back out of the purchase right after I send the invoice, I will refuse to sell anything to you in the future (yes, that includes if you offer me something like $300 on something that I'm selling for much less). 

 **Do not use the chat function**, I honestly don't know how you are taken to the chat function when the bot's verification post gives you a link to PM sellers. I will ignore you and you won't be in consideration for anything until you send me a PM. I will also ignore you if you do not comment before sending a PM.

If I don't respond, it's likely because I'm just busy doing other things. I will get to all messages accompanying comments in a timely manner. Thanks for checking out the post."

Epoch 80 details:
The board is in good condition with tiny mark on right side of the case (see photos). One screw is tight, but works as intended. The PCB has been flashed with VIA and desoldered. PCB has a little left over solder and some flux, but no sign of lifted pads. It has a mark in the upper left corner (see photo). On the inside of the case the silicone pads have left a 'wet' mark, not noticeable from the outside. Plate has been manually cut to support ISO. This was how KBDFans handled the issue at time of sale. I'm unsure if the plates being offered now support ISO from the start. I mention all of these small things just to be totally transparent, I think the board is in great shape overall.

For sale is this MGA Standard bundle complete with a backup pcb and other accessories. Ancient Curse DMG is trade only — see below. 

*WTS — CONUS ONLY:*

1. A-Stock Silver MGA Standard Bundle — **$390 shipped**

This board and all the accessories were purchased new during the in-stock summer sale and used in my weekly rotation until about a week ago. 

BUNDLE INCLUDES:


 - 1x A-Stock silver case (USB-C) (no marks or ano imperfections) 


 - 2x Sneakbox hotswap USB-C PCBs


 - 1x Silver Sneakbox knob + encoder


 - 1x Black GMMK Pro knob


 - 1x Sneakbox POM plate


 - 1x Sneakbox FR4 plate


 - 1x set of case/PCB foam


 - All hardware including all screws, unsoldered LEDs, and a set of 7305 sockets for split backspace/rshift positions


 - Optional: Brass plate — +$35


Please see album for photos of condition and pcb tests. From what I can see, the case has no marks aside from some slight dirt in a couple of the screw holes. The FR4 and POM plates both have typical minor scratches from pulling switches. 

Both pcbs were tested with switches in to confirm the sockets are functioning. Switches were placed into both caps lock positions and tweezers were used to test the unsoldered split backspace and rshift. 

Will also include 16x 7305 millmax sockets free of charge for filling out the split positions on both pcbs. 

PM is open for any questions or reasonable offers!

Hereby I'm selling my last board that I build recently its about 2 months old and in basically new state. I build it for a lightweight board to take to work but I just find myself not using it at all. I would highly prefer selling it as a full build so that will have priority its not FCFS. For the build its build with C3 Equalz stabs which have been lubed by me with krytox G205, Its build with stock Gazzew Bobagum silent Linear's (52g) Comes with 10 extra switches. It also has some Korea keycaps from kbdfans on it. The board comes with all the original boxes/accesories even the original packages for the PCB etc etc. Im selling the full build including fees but not including shipping for 310,00 (I again highly prefer selling as a whole build)

The deskmat is in good shape used for about a month cleaned weekly (with a cleaning towel) comes in original packaging I'm selling it for 35,00 excluding shipping but including fees.

Price include Paypal fees but do not include shipping.

EU only

Up for grabs is a Function96 V2 Keyboard. This thing looks and sounds incredible.

Build Specs:

* F96 V2 - Raw Finish
* Built w/ Lubed Boba U4Ts on FR4 plate
* GMK WoB included! Some shine. The rest of the caps are included and will be shipped in bags.
* Includes an extra brand new PCB and extra FR4 plate.

It'd be extremely difficult to find a scratch or knick on the board. In my opinion, this sounds better than most popular boards out there (7V, Jelly, Voice, Think). I've used it on and off for work.

Selling for $600 shipped! Just the board alone was around $500 before extras.

* HASU Controller (Loaded with VIA, QMK compatible)
* Norbauer Heavy-6 Motorsport Yellow housing with powder coat textured finish
* Fully lubed with Tribosys 3203 (rails) and Krytox 205g0 (stabs)
* Novatouch sliders and stabilizers (except the spacebar which uses the original purple silenced Topre stems). It uses the silencing rings on every slider :)
* Will also throw in a custom coiled yellow mini USB cable made by Tokas Cable Works.
* Will ship it properly protected inside a TX bag (included) with the original packaging from Norbauer, leftover BKE domes, Novatouch sliders, original domes, original plastic case, original controller, keycaps and every other Topre related leftovers that I might have (PBT spacebars, etc).

Spent the long weekend organizing things for this sale as I need to manage this hobby a little better.

All prices include PP fees but not shipping. Priority goes to local and bundles. I'm located in SoCal near 91765 for those interested in local meetups.

For trades, don't have anything in particular, but if you have interesting boards in 65% or 75% layouts or keysets I'd like to take a look.

PM's only please, no chat.

| ~~[Jelly Epoch DewDrop](https://imgur.com/a/6n0IYqV). Comes with both Hotswap and Solder PCBs and Alu and PC plates. Bought a SE and 7v aftermarket so this is an extra. BNIB~~ | ~~$900~~ *Sold*
| [Think 6.5 v2 2u #1 PC/Black](https://imgur.com/a/rVFr4aB). PC top, Black alu bottom. Matching white badge and weight. Bought multiples aftermarket to make a combination I wanted. Otherwise new. Will include an extra foam from Stupidfish. | $550
| ~~[Think 6.5 v2 2u #2 PC](https://imgur.com/a/axBrjR2). BNIB PC top and bottom. Friend thought he wanted one, but then decided he didn't~~ | ~~$550~~ *Sold*
| ~~[TX-66 White](https://imgur.com/a/hveWmGO). Love this board and tbh on the fence about selling. I have a FC660C to satisfy this layout, and a TX-60 on the way so it feels a little redundant. Bought second hand and previous owner had mill maxed the pcb but it comes with a new PCB in case that's not your thing. Boba U4T's will be removed before sale, Durock v2 clear stabs with modified holee and lube will remain. Also comes with new FR4 plate and case~~ | ~~$600~~ *Withdrawn*

Hey,

it's time to get rid of some of the stuff I collected since joining this hobby.

GMK Bushido Base Kit - has been used for roughly a month and has slight shine on Z and X. It was mounted on a 65% keyboard so most of the mods were never mounted. Asking for 170€ or other GMK Sets. Would prefer to ship in bags, +5€ if I have to ship in the original trays

~~Akko Neon (Cherry Profile) - was mounted on a board but only used for a couple days. No shine at all - basically brand new. Asking for 30€~~  **SOLD**

GMMK Compact ISO - was my first entry into this hobby. Used quite a lot and therefore has the slight scratch on the plate (refer to the pictures). Asking for 30€

~~72x Durock Dolphins - lubed (Krytox 205g0) and filmed (black TX Films). These were only mounted once for testing but I never ended up using them in a board after lubing and filming. Asking for 50€~~ **SOLD**

~~NK65v2 E-White - this one was also used for quite a bit but has no visual flaws at all. The case is still in perfect condition and even the plate has no permanent markings. This board also comes with the original carrying case. Asking for 180€~~ **SOLD**

&#x200B;

Most prices are obo (all besides the Bushido base kit because that is already at cost) and excluding shipping. It is possible to bundle stuff from this list with according discounts. Please comment here before sending a PM"

Hey-hey, MM!

My monthly trades/selling post! Just like every time, I'm just a man-boy standing in front of the faceless void of a community forum, asking them to trade with him.

# HAVES:

Below is this month's list of the info for the artisans I have *(shipping isn't included)*.

Artkey/Jelly Key/Keypora/Lats all have authenticity cards and anything that came in a rigid case (Jelly Key, Clackeys, etc) will come with that, too.

If it has a price, it's ***also*** ***open for trades***. Happy to do n:1 or top up with paypal if that's how it shakes out.

Also, I've had these Laser sets gathering dust. I've never opened them, but I placed their orders when I got into the hobby, before I realized how much I preferred backlit caps. Hoping these get to a good home! Happy to provide pics of caps in better lighting / butts upon request.

Prices are negotiable.

Hello! I am letting go of this absolute gem of a Topre build because I am no longer interested in Topre boards and I am looking to downsize my collection. I am willing to sell it without keycaps.

All prices are OBO and include Paypal fees (willing to consider lower offers).

\- **Motorsport Yellow Heavy-6 Topre build - 1100 USD OBO including insured shipping WORLDWIDE**

* Leopold FC660C Low Noise Edition (silenced purple sliders)
* HASU Controller (Loaded with VIA, QMK compatible)
* Norbauer Heavy-6 Motorsport Yellow housing with powder coat textured finish
* Fully lubed with Tribosys 3203 (rails) and Krytox 205g0 (stabs)
* Novatouch sliders and stabilizers (except the spacebar which uses the original purple silenced Topre stems). It uses the silencing rings on every slider :)
* Will also throw in a custom coiled yellow mini USB cable made by Tokas Cable Works.
* Will ship it properly protected inside a TX bag (included) with the original packaging from Norbauer, leftover BKE domes, Novatouch sliders, original domes, original plastic case, original controller, keycaps and every other Topre related leftovers that I might have (PBT spacebars, etc). Comes with its own Leopold Mini-USB cable as well.

# Keyboards-

**Percent Canoe Gen 2:**

* Homelander.
* Includes 2 PCB/plate/switch combos (essentially 2 unique keyboards).
* 1: Red brass switch plate, red brass mid plate, PC top plate. Tangerines L&F (TX films), lubed clear Durock v2 stabs. Very, very small mark above the 4-5 keys, very difficult to notice under normal lighting but wanted to be transparent.
* 2: PC switch plate, PC mid plate, blue alu top plate. Ink Blacks L&F (Deskeys), spring swapped with 68f Thicthock progressive springs, Stupid Fish plate foam, lubed smoky Durock v2 stabs. The PC top plate has some small marks, nothing egregious. Timestamp shows the worst (above 9-0 keys) but isn't noticeable under normal lighting.
* Even though there is only 1 set of extras like the lighting diffuser and badge, I have swapped the PCB/plate/switch combos to create very different keyboards.
* Top plates, mid plates, and aforementioned hardware can easily be configured to whatever combination you'd like.
* SS weight is in great shape, no scratches.
* The rest of case has Stupid Fish foam.
* Asking $530 shipped for everything above (keysets in photos are not included in this price). **Edit to original listing, I'm only looking to sell everything above as a complete bundle, not breaking up the PCB/plate/switch combos)

**Boardsource The Mark: 65 \*\*SOLD\*\***

* ~~PC case.~~
* ~~Includes 5 degree riser, Alu plate, FR4 plate, hotswap PCB, and Stupidfish foam kit.~~
* ~~No stabs included.~~
* ~~Case does have light-medium scratches on the top (USB) side from daily use. Upwards-facing (keycap) side is in great shape. Nothing too bad but marks are noticeable under specific conditions and if looking for them. Taken into pricing consideration.~~
* ~~Asking $230 shipped for everything above (keyset in photo is not included in this price).~~

Hi mechmarket I’m here again to off load some stuff. My prices are obos with shipping included to conus, and I highly prefer selling it to someone in the states. Let me know if the price are wack, and I’ll change according to other listing.

1. ADK64 with NOS Alps yellow with AEK Keycaps and some Alps Salmon: Asking for $210 shipped
Took a while to source everything and built it to try the highly regarded alps linears and I got kinda bored of it, and it was a massive pain to try to open one to lube so nah i’m sticking to MX for now.

SOLD FOR ASKING

2. GMK Belafonte bundle: Asking for $240 shipped.
Everything is sealed in the factory seal, and not much else to say honestly.

3. GMK Godspeed Columbia Bundle: Asking for $190 shipped
The box got messed up during shipping so these will be shipped in bags. Other than that there’s no shine that I can see since these were used for an hour I would say while typing some emails and stuff.

4. CRP APL: Asking for $200 shipped
Full disclosure, there is some shine especially on the gamer keys, I don’t like how pbt sounds so letting these go, they are cool though.

If you want trades then I’m looking for any cool 60% boards mainly but open to any except 40s. Open to n:1 or n:1 + paypal.

Note: If I do sell either godspeed or belafonte I’ll keep the other blue set since I kinda like the color scheme.

Note2: Please don’t message me about older listing, I don’t pay attention to them and I’ve had way too many people asking me about a listing I made months and months ago"

Free Cool Gray 65% Keebmat with keyboard purchase. It's like new and has never actually been used. It's a bit longer than my 65% keyboard and I didn't really like how it looked.

I would absolutely love a macropad since I got my first artisans from Blue Bomber Fox and I love them. I desperately want a macropad that can fit 5 to 8 artisans, if it has a rotary encoder that's the dream.

[August 5 Timestamps, I ended up getting too distracted to make a post.](https://imgur.com/a/GcqgVVc)

* **Tofu 60:** The keyboard is in excellent conditions and I can't see any cosmetic defects, dents, scratches or cracks in the casing. The keyboard sounds great to me and I really love it but I found myself really missing arrow keys and got a Tofu65. | DZ60RGB v2 Hotswap, PC Plate & Foam Has 205g0 + 105 on Spring Lubed Black Inks + Durock v2 205g0 Lubed Stabs Pictured keycaps are also included, they were like $28 on Amazon - nothing fancy but I actually like them. They also sound much better than the GMK Lasers and Infinikey BoW key caps. **$260 Shipped**

* **NK65 Clear NK65 EE Clear | Gateron Aliaz Silent | Infinikey BoW Keycaps** [Original Seller's Description]: I have a love/hate relationship with the NK65. I think its a great price and feels good, but I've used multiple versions of it and it has a lot of problems. For this board in particular, the top right mounting post has cracked and been removed. There is a cracked plate mounting point in top right (~~[~~see image~~](https://i.imgur.com/lAKKCqd.jpg)~~). The ESC key hotswap socket popped off and I had to re-solder it myself and I added some hot glue to further reinforce it. There are also some small scratches on the plate from the switch puller; these can't be seen when switches are in the keyboard. 

* I built this board to get close to my beloved HHKB. But it's still an MX board so it's more like typing on a tactile keyboard while someone yells *Topre!* from another room. Here is a [**sound test**](https://youtu.be/fFwWND8tQYY). I still love the way it sounds/feels. Adhesive foam has been added to the underside of the plate, and the stock stabs have been modded with dialectric grease and electric tape. The Aliaz switches have been lightly lubed with 3204, the ones that had bad housing wobble have been filmed (so not all of them), and those terrible springs have been swapped with 60g springs from retired Cherry blues. Note: the spacebar switch has a 70g spring. I don't really recommend taking this keyboard apart, it's good to go right out of the box.**$150 Shipped**

* **Blue Coiled Cable**: I'm not sure what material this is but it isn't techflex or paracord. It feels smooth and I absolutely love how vivid the blue color is but I bought this coiled cable and now I'm just rolling with it I guess. Plus if I ever get a macropad I would probably need a matching white cable and I feel like finding a white cable should be extremely easy. **$30 Shipped or $20 w/ Keyboard**"

[Original GB Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/n38h2v/gb_gboy_65_keyboard/). Urethane white, FR-4 plate, sandwich mount. Looks pretty decent with that coating and has quite a bit of heft too! 

Price: $270

**Feng's Smart 68 V1 Silver/Red (used) (not to be confused with Magicforce 68 Smart)**

[Geekhack thread](https://web.archive.org/web/20180703134842/https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=83442.0). One of the first custom keyboards that came with hotswap sockets. I am selling a Silver V1 (low profile) with a red plate. Layout B (which is rather unconventional). 

It's actually quite a nice low-profile board. Almost not bezel to it. Here a [few photos with SA keycaps](https://imgur.com/a/p3Nmm) but it also looks quite good with GMK. Stabs need to be relubed.

Price: $100 (!!)

**Prime_Elise (Rose gold, hotswap)**

Can't get used to 40%. Comes with Brass plate and extra PCB. One of the PCBs is millmaxed (-> hotswappable). Looks really nice. (Note: this does _not_ come with the keycaps in the timestamp picture)
Also comes with wood wrist rest (Cherry). 

Price: $300

I have a few keysets for trade/sale today. This is not fcfs. I will prioritize trades, bundles, and local sales to the Chicago area. Will discount for bundles/local. Prices include conus shipping and I would prefer to only sell conus at the moment. I have arbitrarily set my prices, so if they're whack, feel free to make an offer. 


For trades, I'm mostly interested in gmk sets. I can be somewhat picky, but I'm open to hearing any offers!

Hello, back with another post! Got some bills to pay, so I have to let some things go. I normally would strike through product descriptions, but I will leave them up to help guide those who are looking to purchase any of the items listed below. 

Only shipping to USA addresses at the moment. **CURRENTLY NOT TAKING ANY TRADE OFFERS.** All prices include **USPS Priority Mail** shipping costs. Please feel free to offer if it means that these things get out of my hands and into yours.

**KEYCAPS PICTURED ON ANY BOARD I LIST IN THIS POST ARE NOT FOR SALE UNLESS EXPLICITLY STATED OTHERWISE**

I cannot do local meetups for lower prices anymore due to a dramatic change in work schedule. Everything will have to be shipped out.

Item|Details|Price|Available
:--|:--|:--|:--
Duck Orion v3 | silver WKL, currently built with 65g MX Clears on stainless steel plate with an h87a PCB. **KEYCAPS NOT INCLUDED.** also includes aluminum full and FR-4 half plate as well as two original PCBs. Case has defects that aren't that visible during normal use. the two original PCBs were soldered/desoldered by previous owner, and all I've done is confirm that they were in the box when I originally bought the board. I can't speak to the quality of the desolder job on either PCB as I haven't looked at them closely. **Price is less than what I paid originally**. | $700 shipped | yes!
smoke PC TMO50v2 | smoky PC case with PCB cleanly de-soldered using an FR-301. yes, this board ran recently but smoke PC didn't make a return as a color. great board, but honestly it's just been sitting on a shelf for the past few months with little to no use. weight has a few spots of patina/tarnish/whatever you want to call it. comes with Cannonkeys carrying case. If you're compelled to make an offer, feel free to do so if it means that you'll be buying it. I need this thing gone and into a better home. | $475 shipped | yes!
Raeds x140 | lubed with GS2 and spring-swapped to TX 70g 16mm. These are pretty cool switches but I'm no longer using these in any builds. a large majority (around 100) have been previously soldered and cleanly desoldered using an SS-02. **I will not be breaking up this quantity unless I can somehow get two buyers to ask for quantities that add up to 140, and I'll be ignoring any PMs that clearly show that you didn't read this part.** | $160 shipped | yes!
black/purple aviator cable | received this as part of a trade, but I have no use for it as I already have a custom cable. coil is on device side, and connector is USB-mini. | $30 shipped | yes!
Pink Haze Bukkakey | by Bad n' Booj. **price is below what I paid retail** | $50 shipped | yes!
Magenta Crayons Eggface v2 | by ETF/Nightcaps. part of the 420 sale this year. **price is below what I paid retail** | $50 shipped First Class | yes
Pika Lucky Cat | by Ko Caps. sold as FCFS when originally released. **price is below what I paid retail** | $50 shipped First Class | yes!
Beggy Phuck | by Rejeck Kaps. I'm not sure why I entered for this one, I didn't even get GMK Greg. **price is below what I paid retail** | $50 shipped First Class | yes!


Priority for responding to offers will be as follows:

 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing all items for asking price (will give discount for purchasing all items listed here because holy moly that means you have money)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any bundle of either keyboard + artisan for asking price (will give discount accordingly)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing either keyboard for asking price
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any bundle of artisans for asking price (will give discount accordingly)
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any one item for asking price

Outside of the listed conditions, I'll check based on when you comment **and** PM. The PM is absolutely necessary for the sale of these items. Since I've had this happen before, if there are two people interested in the same item, but one is willing to pay no questions asked while the other has questions or wants to see more pics, I'm 100% selling to the person who will pay no questions asked. Requests for additional pictures will also take longer than you think, so please consider that when trying to secure an item.

Please understand that if you as a buyer and I agree on a price and you back out of the purchase right after I send the invoice, I will refuse to sell anything to you in the future (yes, that includes if you offer me something like $300 on something that I'm selling for much less). 

 **Do not use the chat function**, I honestly don't know how you are taken to the chat function when the bot's verification post gives you a link to PM sellers. I will ignore you and you won't be in consideration for anything until you send me a PM. I will also ignore you if you do not comment before sending a PM.

If I don't respond, it's likely because I'm just busy doing other things. I will get to all messages accompanying comments in a timely manner. Thanks for checking out the post."
