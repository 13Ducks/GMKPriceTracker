Hello!

PLEASE READ KEYCAPS DESCRIPTION

**GMK 9009 Ortho:**

~~This is not the Obscure kit or an extension pack with just the ortho mods. It's the full ortho kit that ran a few years ago with alphas, numbers, and ortho mods and spacebars, so if you have an ortho board you'll be able to fill it with just this, no base kit needed. IT IS MISSING 2 KEYS (the accent red and green enters). It still has the grey enter and all other Escape and Space accents, just not those 2 enters. All keys are unused.~~ - **Relisted in amended post.**

**Boba U4s 62g (50):** Lubed with 3203 and 105 on the springs. Light application on the legs for smoothness and small impact on tactility. Films are white Deskeys films (actually I ran out so there's 2 with black films but the other 48 are white haha) - ~~**$30 shipped.**~~ Sold $30 shipped.

She has been helping many stray cats/dogs (mainly cats) find homes, seek medical help (including surgeries) as well as helping to foster. I found her work really meaningful (especially because I like cats). Hence, I'll state 2 prices (just $10 difference), if you would like to help, you can opt to purchase the slightly more expensive price, it's perfectly okay if you don't want to. The donation will be publicly recorded at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asY5BAWSZ_pmxUy2jxmaSa1eHDddTiLQlEhGi1niuyw/edit#gid=1722981492), under tehbingg. I'll update here once donated. (I hope this is allowed by the mods, otherwise please let me know, I'll be willing to remove.)

&#x200B;

This would not be FCFS as I would like to prioritize the donation prices to help a little more.

&#x200B;

Local 29209 Columbia SC

Monstargear Alu XO V2 Hotswap - Looking for $360 Local for this. Plate has scratches from the removal of switches. Other than that works perfectly! Only have original brush, no USB-C cable with it.
$410 shipped.

GMK Dots + Mousepad - Looking for $400 Local for these. They were used for about a week, I love them a lot, but I don't love them enough to use them as $300 keycaps. $420 shipped, but entertaining local first.

I would like to entertain local first, if nothing bites, then I will ship. The keyboard seemed to be very expensive to ship to me (around $50?) so I am very hesitant to deal with that annoying mess.

What's up everyone!

I hope you're all doing great! I am changing up my interest and am thus letting go part of my Monochrome collection. Before we go further, a quick word:

&nbsp;

※ This will not be FCFS, I will go like this: Trades > Bundles > Sales.

※ All prices are *OBO* meaning that I may accept lower offers, feel free to negotiate. I don't want a bid war, if a key is marked as pending/sold/traded, no need to PM me to offer more.

※ Prices include PP fees but don't include shipping (PM me for confirmation);

  &nbsp;

I've finally got my preferences dialed in and no longer need these extras. I want to sell them quickly and the prices are a little low to reflect that. CONUS only please! Please note that the prices do not reflect shipping costs, we'll estimate that if you decide to buy something. Not FCFS as I'll be offering big discounts for bulk buyers.   
  
&nbsp;

The Rama and Tofu are in ""good"" condition and the EO-87 is essentially pristine. The EO-87 and M65-A are soldered and the tofu is hotswap, I won't be de-soldering anything so this is an ""as-is"" sort of thing. All keycap sets have been used a fair amount so a little bit of shine can be expected on all except perhaps the Delta and Infinikey sets.

[Extra Picture of KC](https://imgur.com/gallery/s2TlyN1)

Hello Friends,

I lost my job today at a startup due to loss of investment, therefore I am selling some of my keyboard stuff to pull through until I secure a job.

**~~GMK Space Cadet (Used for few weeks, no shine) - $ 250 + Shipping~~** **~~(OBO, Open to local 95110)~~**  **- \*\*SOLD\*\* $245 Shipped**

**~~Flawless~~** **~~Keycult 1/65 rev 1 Black/Red (A Stock) - $ 1900 + Shipping (OBO, Open to local 95110)~~**  **- \*\*SOLD\*\* for asking price**

Please see the description below:

1. It is an  A stock and in the Black/Red colorway. The following is what came with the keyboard:

a. 1 X PCB

b. Teflon Guide pins, hex screws and tools for the screws

c. Keyboard, 3 pieces, top, bottom and the red weight

d. Red Aluminum spring leaf plate

In Addition to these items I bought the following:

a) 1 X PCB

b) 1 X Brass Spring Plate

I built this two months ago and used 1 X PCB and soldered Millmax 7305-0-15-15-47-27-10-0  sockets on it. This PCB also has  Durock stabs installed. They have been lubed with Dielectric grease and Krytox 205g0. It has extra lube as I like the stabs to be completely silent (might be a little messy). Based on my testing (and hearing) there is no rattle. If you did not know, 7305 is not compatible with some switches, I have successfully tried Blueberry and Tangerine v2 switches. The Zeal switches will not work on Millmax as the width of the pins is larger. The same applies to Kailh Box switches.  However, I believe you will be using high end switches on this board but please do check 😊 .

The whole point of the millmax was to try various switch and plate options before committing to a  solder build on the extra PCB. As of this time, there are no more extra PCBs (they mostly restock ) but there are extra Aluminum and Brass plates with PC plates coming up soon on Keycult’s  website.

The extra PCB has not been taken out of the original anti static bag, therefore untested.  But I can help in getting a replacement, or if you want me to test it I will gladly do it for you.

The keyboard will be shipped with all the original package and extras as well as the original shipping box from KC.

The whole build was done on a desk mat on the key cult fiber cloth.

Please note that the keyboard does not come with switches or keycaps

Please PM me if you have any questions !

I will prioritize users with /mm trade history!

**Extra Considerations:**

1. Payment: I would like to conduct the transaction through Paypal, This way we both are protected. In addition, I will only ship to the address on Paypal and it must be a verified Paypal account.
2. Shipping: You will be responsible for shipping (I will add insurance, the insurance will be for the amount on the Paypal Invoice) I would suggest going with UPS or FEDEX as I have had a nightmare with USPS losing stuff . The cost will be added to your PayPal invoice. CONUS ONLY (Sorry!) ","[US-CA] [H] Keycult 1/65 rev. 1 Black/Red (A Stock), GMK Crimson Cadet [W] Paypal"

Hello r/mm!

Here today to just sell my set of GMK Cafe and the Enter RAMA. Bought these both a few months back on the aftermarket and have not been using them at all, so it's time to let them go for my cost. Prices are as listed below, and all negotiable.

**~~GMK Cafe Base~~** ~~(New, never mounted) - $300 USD shipped in trays. Plastic has been cut to see if there were any defects. Has not been used at all.~~ ***SOLD FOR ASKING***

**GMK Cafe RAMA Enter (Preparer)** \- $230 USD shipped ($200 if bundled with base). Was mounted for 5 minutes where I realized I would rather use the cream accent enter from the base.

Have a Rama works Koyu in the race colorway. The board has unlubed healios as well as the internal dampener. There are a few flaws shown in the pictures. Red sam is from the R1 run but does not have the novelties or the hiragana alphas. Caps have some shine to them. The board is fully functional.

[A Stamp of Time](https://imgur.com/a/UAfxGEa)

I am back, still trying to downsize collection to raise money for postgrad fees. A big thanks to everyone who has helped me out so far, and those who have sent me nice messages of support!

Once again,  this sale is **not** FCFS, I will be prioritising bundles, local deals, people I have traded with before, those with verified paypals, and people who have trade history. Due to the ongoing pandemic, sales are CONUS only - Canadian buyers will be considered but preference is within the United States.

I will be using USPS Priority Mail. Packages *should* be delivered within 2-3 days, but please be aware that USPS has been experiencing significantly delays as of late - appreciate the understanding if shipping is slow!

I am open to negotiating prices, though will be prioritising those who meet my asking price. Please consult the individual albums of each item for more photos - and do not hesitate to ask me for more photos!

|[~~S7 Elephant: Black/Purple~~](https://imgur.com/a/8P9k8vF)|~~This is a black and purple S7 Elephant from r2. I bought this off of another community member earlier this year, but never got a chance to build it up. Comes with 1 clean pcb, 1 polycarb plate, original box and accessories. Top is black, bottom is purple, no blocker. Some scuffs on the inside of the purple bottom, but not visible when built. Will also include a silver aluminum plate and brass plate from r1, a custom cut PETG plate (was gonna test it vs the PC), and green C3 stabs lubed with 205g0. Can also throw in some millmaxes at no additional cost :)~~|~~$1150 shipped (exactly what I paid for it). Priority for the elephant will be East Coast US over the rest of CONUS.~~ **SOLD locally for $915**|
|[~~Brutal60: Navy~~](https://imgur.com/a/AYzERHH)|~~This is a navy Brutal60, I think from round 3? Case has scuff on the left side, small ding in the top right corner. Comes with Cannonkeys case, 1 instant60 (hotswap) pcb, 1 Wilba Kate pcb (unused), polyfill, and new 6.25u and 7u fr4 plates. Navy is slightly darker than the navy used for the Savage65 and most recent run of Brutal60s. Please see album for further photos.~~|~~$345 shipped (might seem high, but most of this is to factor the cost of the Wilba Kate pcb, plus I bought the plates and the case specifically for this sale).~~ *~~Prefer not to split components~~* **SOLD for asking**|
|[~~Savage65: Green~~](https://imgur.com/a/dXe5Pcj)|~~This is a green savage65 from the first round of May 2020. A-stock, case is flawless. Built with RT Cherry MX Blacks, on 6.25u fr4 plate, lubed with 205g0. In its current configuration, the top right switch no longer works, (aka where a top right blocker would be), pads have been burned. Can probably be jumped, but I'm not sure how to do this. Comes with Cannonkeys case, 1 extra solder pcb (unused), 1 fr4 7u plate, and extra stock RT Cherry MX Blacks~~|~~$380 shipped~~ **SOLD in more recent post**|
|[~~E8.5: E-white~~](https://imgur.com/a/0mmurUs)|~~E-white WKL E8.5, unbuilt, unboxed just for timestamp. Comes with hotswap and solder pcbs. NO GASKET. Doesn't seem like it came with the dampener that goes between the plate and pcb either. Comes with green, ewhite, brass, corner accent, green and brass toblerone accent, 1 green alu plate, 1 ewhite alu plate, original box and accessories.~~|~~$710 shipped~~ **SOLD**|

Hello friends!

Since I ordered a new keyboard that should be shipped soon, I wanted to go ahead and sell my Black Ink Polycarb KBD67MK2.

This keyboard is awesome but I have other keyboards on order and need to part with this one to fund more.  This hobby is addicting!  This keyboard does have some imperfections from my use for the past few months but overall is in great condition.

Case - KBD Fans KBD67 MKii

PBC - KBD67 mkii Solderable PCB

Plate - KBD67 mkii brass plate

Switches - Gateron Black Inks lubed w/ Krytox 205g0

Stabilizers - GMK Cherry Stabilizers clipped and lubed w/ Dielectric grease

**DOES NOT INCLUDE KEYCAPS**

**Asking Price = $450 OBO + Shipping**

Hello friends,

I am sad and broke after doing my giveaway on Twitch and buying Christmas gifts this year, and I need to make room for incoming boards.

Prices do not include shipping or fees. Local buyers are welcome (as contactless as possible), I live north of Seattle, specifically 98275, but I can also drive.

**If you'd like to bundle the KN2.10² with GMK Peaches and Cream, because they're basically made for each other, I'll sell them together for $800 ($100 off).**

Looking to sell a Tada68 Keyboard that has **some faulty parts** due to bad desoldering attempts. It was my first ever board and now that I've been in the community for some time and know what I like, I'm hoping someone else will enjoy using it instead.

Noted Faults:

* PCB pads of the top right HOME key and bottom left Windows key do not work due to burning off the pads during desoldering. **(HOME AND WIN KEY DOES NOT WORK)**
* Enter and Spacebar stabs slightly unbalanced meaning longer keycaps do not fit flush. Can be fixed through desoldering and fixing the wires.
* The PCB (Kbdfans67 Rev 2) no longer works with via. Have flashed it with QMK multiple times but I'm not sure if it is the fault of the pcb or just my incompetence that the pcb is no longer recognized with via.

Due to the noted faults above, I have removed the cost of the PCB from the item. The keyboard still works fine for use.

Merry Christmas!

I'm looking to sell this e-white Polaris for less than what I bought it for unbuilt to cover some unexpected costs. It will not come with GMK Oblivion. Ai03 confirmed that there won't be any WK layout Polaris extras next year, so I figured there might be some interest here! 

Specs/built with the following:  
- Aluminum half plate  
- Pacos 67g lightly lubed with 3204 (Halo stems, NK Cream housing, tactile)  
- Polaris PCB  
- Gold Weight  
- Split backspace layout
- Tsangan bottom row (7U spacebar)  
- Genuine GMK stabs, clipped, lubed with 205g0  
- Case mounted gaskets

Weight has a very light patina on it, and has a very light hairline scratch that apparently came from the factory. Super tiny scuff on the backside of the board, not visible during use. [Pictures here](https://imgur.com/a/1ecteGj)

Will come with universal brass plate in the box as well. ~~Looking for **$575 built**.~~

Hello everyone and happy holidays!

Today I want to let go of my set of GMK Olivia. I don't really like the irl colors as much as I expected to so I'll have to let it go. The set has barely been used since until recently I hadn't had a keyboard to put it on.

I am selling it for 245$ + shipping (exactly the price I paid from the mykeyboard extras sale)

Please note that if you are not in the EU I am ONLY willing to ship with express shipping (DHL, UPS etc) which will more than likely be expensive. 

Thank you everyone for looking and happy rest of the holidays!

In very good condition. The brass plate is removeable. Includes original hardware, extra daughterboard, foam between the board and PCB, DIY cut foam between PCB and plate, and stock GMK stabs. The stabs aren't installed because I was using a different set. The bottom brass weight has some slight imperfections/light scratches that came from factory. There's some blemish on the underside of the top-half of the case. Only visible when board is taken apart. You will see in the photos.

Title! Not really looking to split the bundle. Asking $320+Shipping OBO. This is a hair lower than some pricing I've seen recently for the following reasons:

* 2 R1 Up/Down keys, missing R2 Down (May not matter depending on your layout of choice)
* Scuff on G key (pictured, not visible when mounted)
* Scuffs on Shift key (pictured)

~~Looking to either sell or trade these two items listed above. The Olivia light base set is still sealed. I'd really like to trade the Olivia set instead of selling it due to the fact that I got it for a really good price.~~

Keep in mind that the case is not in perfect condition, the finish isn't perfect and there are some scuffs. However, for this price it's a neat little board to mod and spray/cerakote or do whatever you want to it.~~

**Update**

Everything is up to date as of 12/26.
If someone wants all 5 Switches, I'd do $190 or $200 shipped (I bought 180 U4s, so I still have 90, but don't really want to sell unless I get rid of the Halos too for Holy Bobas).


Just cleaning up some additional stuff. Also came to the realization that I am 100% a linear guy and don't enjoy my tactile switches nearly as much, and that I don't enjoy artisans too much.


Local Pickup prioritized, not FCFS 

Please PM, as I don't have Chat on my phone and won't see it

Also looking for an M0110a case (or sell the 100% working PCB/switch/caps I have since my cat decided to knock it off the desk).

I've used it for about 2 months and have kept it very clean and have been very careful with it. It's in perfect condition. Was going to keep this for my collection, but now I need the money for school, so I've finally decided to sell it. Selling it with the switches, not parting. I'll also give you a few extra replacement switches. Looking for $450 shipped CONUS.

**Solder Black KBD67v2 MKII**

The board has a brass plate with screw-in GMK stabilizers. The stabs have been lubed with Krytox 205g0 and Permatex dielectric grease for the wires. It has also been band-aid modded for sound. The PCB has been soldered once before with Holy Pandas. This was my first build so the work is a bit scuffed. The front side of the PCB has some manufacturing imperfections. Other than the PCB, there are no imperfections with the case and weight.

The PCB has been tested after de-soldering and is fully functional. :)

Hello!

Ended up not needing these:

**GMK 8008 40s Kit:** Sealed. ~~$75 shipped.~~ Sold $75 shipped.

Note:

The 8008 R2 GB is currently live. The 40s kit is a bit different in R2 (I don't think it includes the same space bars this one does, since those are in the Base Kit instead). If you have the R1 base you might not be fully covered for some boards with the R2 40s kit. Selling this in case someone wants their 40s kit now instead of whenever R2 ships or if the new kit doesn't have all the keys they need.

Let me know if you have any questions and please comment before PM.

First time selling anything here. I am no stranger to selling custom cables or other keyboard related things elsewhere, please accept my etsy site reviews as semi-verification of sales. I would link the site directly but I don't want to break any rules, just add .com to my username and it'll take you to my etsy.

I've been making cables for quite a few months now and very much enjoy it. Shipping is via USPS First Class for cables, upgrading to priority mail is +$5. The MiTo SA Laser Cyberdeck will ship via UPS. A picture of the cyberdeck set from the group buy has been included to verify all caps have been included

Dear r/mm,

I'm in dire need of some help. Its just gotten way out of hand at this point. I said I'd keep it under control, but I knew I was lying to myself. Where did I go wrong?  I've got several gbs delivering in the next few weeks, and absolutely NOWHERE to store them. Make this a Merry christmas for me and my poor family, please give us somewhere to sleep tonight by buying some of this stuff so I can take the boards off the bed and ship them to you. :( okay, maybe not that desperate. I'm just sick of hearing about it from my MIL. All prices are reasonably negotiable. I'll list at a slightly higher price, shoot me your offer, I come back with a more competitive price, etc. I WILL PRIORITIZE BSP KITS OVER ALL!!!!

ALPS Focus FK2001 w/ Dust cover.

* Magnificent shape, even 20 years later. Extremely minimal wear. 
* Doubleshots, RGB + beige on the ctrl/alt/shift. the true vibes are right here, friends. 
* Pine whites. No exaggeration, this and the following board (omnikey evo) pine whites, if you squint,  almost, almost, allmosssst feel like blue alps. Deliciously crispy.
* Dust cover in perfect shape. Probably why there is such little yellowing across the board. Flip out legs still work. Just take it from me before I regret it. $150 + ships

[https://imgur.com/a/tiMWyTc](https://imgur.com/a/tiMWyTc)

&#x200B;

ALPS Omnikey Evolution

* Ergonomic alps board, also immaculate shape. Comparable in feel to the previous fk2001, but noticeably more crisp. 
* Same doubleshot alps that the focus has, RGB beige mods, as god intended. Almost makes you wish for something like this compatible with MX switches. hmmmm
* Same almost blue-pine-white alps. Seriously good stuff. If you're used to cherry Blue's for your clicky pleasure, prepare for them to forever be inadequate compared to these puppies. $200 + uber to your mothers.

Buckling Spring Unicomp Model M

* Purchased from Unicomp a couple years ago, in perfect physical shape. The buckling springs plenty stiff delicious. 
* Includes dye sub apl sub legends. I really wish I could easily get these on mx.
*  An overall great start if you're just getting into older stuff, Charging what I paid, I'm feeling generous. $100 + shipping
* [https://i.imgur.com/sUnkHkB.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/sUnkHkB.jpg)

ALPS VIP board w/ arabic sublegends

* Could use a bit of cleaning, havent gotten to it just yet. The caps themselves are the star of this board, blue arabic sub legends, beige/rgb ctrl/alt/shift
* Crispy white alps, not as nice as the other two, but still tactile af nonetheless. With the dirt included, its more akin to a crunch than a crisp. you get the gist.
* sweet vintage aesthetic. $60 + shipping

* The original novatouch case is included (unless you don't want it for some reason) and has some slight scuff marks on the soft plastic.  

* Black Novatouch top plate probably needs to be cleaned.  

* Norbauer case has parts on the casing where the shine is noticeably diminished. Notably: along the bottom edge, bottom left corner, and very left side of the top half of the case. I've tried to take pictures of it to the best of my abilities.  

* There is a ding on the bottom left corner of the Norbauer case (see pictures).

Heyo!

I've decided I'm going to switch up my keyboard theme but also need to cushion the Holiday sized dent in my wallet a bit. So in that case I'm selling my GMK Laser set (bought from here about a year ago) with some shine on the alphas (mostly on the ""gaming keys"") + the Mitowaves. I also have a Laser Themed Coiled Aviator cable from Rocket Cables!

* GMK Laser + Mitowaves = Asking $200 Shipped

[The Ocarina of Time-stamp](https://imgur.com/a/M3flUZC)

Hi! I am selling off a lot of stuff that I got here today. I also have some deals offered below, depending on how much you decide to buy off me. Also if you see something that you like, feel free to negotiate a price with me. 

#some prices are open to negotiation. mostly looking to sell these to pay off some debts. 

Items:

|Item|Description|Price|
:--|:--|:--|
|GMK Lime|My second GMK set ever. Mounted once with very little to no shine. The pack with the artisans is still sealed and hasn't been opened. Great looking set, but just need to clear up some space for other GMK sets. Deal below for it. |$265 shipped|
|GMK Calm Depths|My first ever GMK set. Mounted a couple times with very little to no shime on it as well and has been well taken care of. Comes with everything you see in the photo. Deal below for it.|$265 shipped|
|Drop Holy Panda Packs|I have a couple sealed Drop Holy Panda packs. I have the standard x110 pack from the original first run of it, and a still sealed x330 pack that they used to offer, but do not offer anymore. Both are still sealed (as stated before), and have been kept in storage for a while. Overall some nice amounts of switches if you are looking to do a lot of builds with them, or collect the variant that isn't sold today. Both prices are shipped.|$130 for x110 or $390 for x330|
|Gateron Laser Switches|Gateron laser switches. x70 of each variant. Pretty decent switches overall, but not much my taste. Not sure why I bought them in the first place, but I hope whoever buys them would enjoy them. Deal below.|$50 shipped for each one|
|Programmable Macropad|Macropad that I used to use for osu! and to try out different switches. Works well. Can be reprogrammed with the software from the maker. I will see if I can use a spare thumbdrive to hold the software on it or give you a piece of paper with info on the software. I'll also throw in a USB C cable with it. Deal below for it. |$45 shipped|
|Custom Aviator USB cable with extra connector|It is made by Asceny. It was their first run of cables that they did. It is a light blue color with clear techflex and comes with a Mini USB and a USB type C connector, so it should be able to fit most keyboards. The ends are heatwrapped. |$30 shipped|


Artisans (Everything to the right of the Saur and Scarab are in bundles of two. Really don't want to break a bundle. Going from left to right.):

|Artisan|Description|Price|
:--|:--|:--|
|Keys and Crafts' Fuji Artisan|A very nice lemony artisan. If you like lemons, you will 100% enjoy this. It isn't edible. Looks very edible, but it would be way less than ideal for you to try and eat it. I am not liable for injuries caused by non-standard use of this keycap. |$60 shipped|
|Rose Key Koi Artisan|A very nice artisan from Rose Key. It has a small koi fish floating around in. Not a real one. Don't get too excited. We aren't that far in the future to have those yet. |$45 shipped|
|Blue Fox's Saur - Base Water Set Artisan|Very nice keycap. It may not be as good as a Char or Squir keycap, but it is still nice. Has a makers mark underneath it. Would fit very nicely on Pokemon themed builds. |$50 shipped|
|Dusty Caps 65% Blockerless Keyboard Artisan Keycap|In the Aldufin colorway. Overall not a bad keycap. Would be nice to put a tiny version of your own keyboard on your keyboard. So if you enjoy it, feel free to buy it from me today. |$75 shipped|
|Beetle Caps Scarab Keycap|In the Jack-o-Lantern colorway. It is a orange Scarab with a Jack-o-Lantern face on the back on a green base.|$60 shipped|
|Migi Caps SHADOW NewTwo and Blank Artisans Bundle|If you have played Pokken Tournament before, you may have seen Shadow MewTwo before. Due to copyright reasons and not wanting to get a cease and desist from Nintendo, this keycap has nothing to do with it. The colors are similar, but we will leave it at that. Overall, a pretty nice keycap. Doesn't fit much with my style, now that I have it on hand.|$95 shipped|
|Win Keys' Clutch Artisans Bundle|In the GMK Fundamentals VOL 1 and VOL 2 colorways, these would fit nicely for your incoming keycap set. Since I didn't get my hands on a spot for GMK Fundamentals, I am selling these to someone who has it and would like some nice artisans to match their kit. |$130 shipped|


Deals offered:
- If you buy both GMK sets, I will do $500 shipped on it. 

- The more artisans you buy, the price of shipping all of them will be $5. It will be taken off the current prices shown for each artisan, and will be added later at checkout. 

- For an extra $5 when you buy the macropad, I will throw in a couple of extra switches that I have on hand. Ill give you the choices of switches if you want to purchase the macropad.

- If you buy both packs of gateron laser switches, I will take $8 off the total (About $92 shipped).

- and possibly more through negotiation.

\*\*BOARDS\*\*

~~CandyBar premium in white, comes with cable, PCB, poly plate, original box, never built- (this case is flawless, unlike some of the others with QC issues I've seen). $325~~  **~~$300~~** ~~shipped~~ SOLD bundled with the pandas.

~~Noxary 268.2 in clear polycarbonate, 5mm brass plate, super heavy brass weight, spare brand new PCB and one millmaxed hotswap pcb with a couple small jumps. Works great, sounds great. Plate and weight have tarnish and case has some small imperfections. PC has a few hairlines around screws and screw tappings don’t “lock” the screws so well anymore so there are some minor things like that. With that in mind, price is ~~$425~~ **$400** shipped, way below GB price.~~ SOLD

KBDFans D60 HHKB style keyboard, e-white top and aluminium black bottom, all accessories and spare parts. GMK White on black (unused caps in original packaging). C3 x TKC Tangerine 67g.

Strongly prefer not to separate. Keyboard is used a couple of time.

I can't get the space bar to sound right, and it's become a major source of frustration in my life. So I'm selling it. The space bar and stab wire are both straight. Nothing is damaged. I just lack the time/patience/skill to tune it.

Asking 500. That's is how much I paid for everything. The keyboard is only used a couple of times. The e-white D60 is sold out on KBDFans. Tangerine is sold out on TKC. Next drop of GMK WoB ships in 3 months, and it's sold out on Drop's Amazon.

There is one screw-in smokey Durock stab on the left spacebar and all the others are screw-in GMK stabs (all stabs were lubed with Krytox 205g0). This is a great way to try an interesting split design with some of the most popular tactile switches out there. **There are some issues with this board, hence the discounted price:**

* Left ctl (the bottom left corner switch before the macro columns) is *extremely* sensitive to touch. Just tapping the key will cause it to start spamming. I'm not really sure what the issue could be (my best guess is that I messed with the leaf somehow when lubing and reassembling), but it can be avoided by just making that key do nothing with VIA/QMK. 
* One of the Box Jades on the macro columns was not pressed in all the way before I soldered it. I know, rookie mistake :( My desoldering equipment is really crummy which is what's kept me from fixing it myself. The switch works properly, but it def affects the aesthetics. Shouldn't be too hard a fix though if you have better desoldering equipment than I do.
* The right hand USB-C port does not work. I've reviewed the soldering work I did around the area and didn't find any evidence of shorts, but it may be something I overlooked or just a completely different issue. The port did work when I got the board, but was not working at the end of soldering. **The left port works perfectly fine, so the board is still usable!** All the LEDs and other electronics on the right side of the board work perfectly fine as well.

# EOTW Planck: sold!

# Assorted switches: $55

Over the past year I've accumulated some switches as I've searched for new and cool things to try. I ordered them in small batches, but the T1s are in a bigger batch. You can buy them all for $55! This is barely more than the cost of just the T1s as a reference. This would be a good way to get a bunch of different tactiles to help you find your next fav switch!

I hugely appreciate the support on my last post, thank you to all who expressed interest or left a nice comment. Back again with my attempts to purge my collection so I can raise funds in preparation for postgraduate fees as I have decided to apply for a masters in environmental history.  This sale is **not** FCFS, I will be prioritising bundles, local deals, people I have traded with before, those with verified paypals, and people who have trade history. Due to the ongoing pandemic, sales are CONUS only.

I will be using USPS Priority mail. Packages for deals finalised tonight will go out tomorrow, anything finalised tomorrow or afterwards won't go out until AFTER Christmas.

I am open to negotiating prices, though will be prioritising those who meet my asking price. Please consult the individual albums of each item for more photos - and do not hesitate to ask me for more photos!

I am still looking for a Keylabs Ronin Violet Urbana artisan - if you have one, let's make a deal!

Hi everyone! Clearing out the closets for the end of the year, got a few keebs to go to good homes :)

Item | Price | Description
:--|:-:|:--
[Drop Alt Laser + GMK Plum](https://imgur.com/a/ddjOA2Z) | £360 |  Drop Alt Laser from the original run, great condition apart from the ding on the front right corner. The PCB also has one socket which has been replaced and connected with jump wire (still fully functional including hotswap capability). It's built with lubed+filmed speed silvers which sound pretty good IMO. [Sound test.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p8uxsrlp1m2q99f/Drop%20Alt%20sound%20test.m4a?dl=0) Comes with a GMK Plum base kit + matching cable, lightly used, maybe a tiny amount of shine on some alphas. Can ship in original trays. 
[Blue alu/acrylic sandwich](https://i.imgur.com/QWzTShA.jpg) | £175 | Built with broken-in creams lubed with 205g0 and tuned Zeal stabs, and comes with a matching coiled aviator cable.  [Here's a sound test.](https://i.imgur.com/VMjJRyW.mp4) All the parts are in excellent condition except the DZ60 RGB PCB which I rescued after the previous owner lifted a few pads. It has a couple of jumper wires but is fully functional. 
Bamboo 60%. | £100 | Built with a GH60 PCB, lubed Gat silent browns, alu plate. The clip-in PCB-mount stabs are tuned and it comes with a matching mini-USB cable.

Hi guys!

I have the following sets for sale, prices do not include shipping.

I am looking to donate some cash from this sale to a local cat rescuer, can view her instagram at [.@fioloh](https://www.instagram.com/fioloh/?hl=en). She has been helping many stray cats/dogs (mainly cats) find homes, seek medical help (including surgeries) as well as helping to foster. I found her work really meaningful (especially because I like cats). Hence, I'll state 2 prices (just $10 difference), if you would like to help, you can opt to purchase the slightly more expensive price, it's perfectly okay if you don't want to. The donation will be publicly recorded at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asY5BAWSZ_pmxUy2jxmaSa1eHDddTiLQlEhGi1niuyw/edit#gid=1722981492), under tehbingg. I'll update here once donated. (I hope this is allowed by the mods, otherwise please let me know, I'll be willing to remove.)

This would not be FCFS as I would like to prioritize the donation prices to help a little more.

That being said, here are the kits:

Hello mm!

Looking to sell my lightly used GMK 8008 Base Kit today for **~~$250 SHIPPED OBO (CONUS only for now)~~**~~!~~   **SOLD** Please see timestamp for *hopefully* detailed pictures capturing the shine on the alphas.

&#x200B;

Information about the set: I purchased the set aftermarket, SEALED, about 2.5 months ago. Since then, I have been using the set on-and-off on a 60% board. The numrow, function keys, arrows, and most extras in the set are still like brand new. As is, there is some shine across the alphas, with some having more shine than others. I have not used the set for about a month now.

I am also willing to ship without the tray and sleeve for *$240 USD* \- just let me know which one you prefer. Feel free to message me asking for more pictures, or if you have any other questions.

I am also aware that R2 is currently running over at Dixie Mech, so if you are willing to wait for that to hopefully ship at the end of 2021, I would recommend going there instead! I am selling for this price as I am just trying to make a portion of my money spent on the aftermarket. I am willing to hear offers and criticism to adjust my prices accordingly.

&#x200B;

hi mechmarket, I hope everyone is enjoying this pleasant Sunday, I'll save my Christmas greetings for the post next week (unless I sell everything, which I highly doubt)

CONUS buyers only, please

No trades at the moment, need more liquidity

Local buyers (Orange County) are strongly preferred, especially for the keyboards

Since I've run out of things to say after posting the same things so many times, I'll get straight to the point.

I'm looking to build a new PC to replace my old one (still rocking 8gb DDR3 ram lol), and I've been lucky enough to snatch a 3060ti from BestBuy recently. I'll still need to buy the other components, which is where the money I get from selling the following things will go towards.

&#x200B;

Note for the Mode Eighty:

In summary, pre-order is available, First Edition is sold out. If you can wait just a little bit, pre-order is probably a better financial decision. If you really want the First Edition, I have a Light one you can buy for much less than the $701.51 total that I paid for it.

It has a DZ60 rev 3 pcb with 63g turquoise tealios. For stabilizers it has kbd stabs for the enter, shift and backspace with a c3 stab for the spacebar. Unfortunately I only had 60 tealios so I used one zealios for the esc key. I am looking to get **$90 + Shipping or trades**

Up for trade is my bro gamer set from the recent Taro sale. It was mounted once but just isn't my thing. One of the caps is a little loose, but the rest fit very snug. ~~$100 + shipping~~ SOLD

Up for trade is my idea23 Topre Mod set, it has everything you need for an HHKB except for the right shift and fn key. **$35 + Shipping or trades**

I am selling a TKL resin wrist rest I just made. It has not been used, only posed for photos on my instagram. There are some minor blemishes on the top that are only visible if you look very close in the right lighting. The bottom of the rest has been sanded but it is not visible at all when it is on your desk. It is a white pearl with subtle black swirl. **$50 + Shipping or trades**

I am selling / trading my SM Keyboards butterstick with a faulty PCB. The PCB might be repairable if you know your way around it. It is transparent purple and blue acrylic. I would prefer to add this in as part of a trade, but I might also be willing to sell it. **$45 + Shipping or trades**

Up for trade is my White POM Iris Rev 4. It has been built with lubed NK Blueberries. It has only been used for a couple of hours and just isn't for me. The only thing worth noting is that I did need to make some cuts on the bottom plate to make the pcb fit properly (See pics for details) but keep in mind it comes with two brand new plates if you would prefer to make the cuts yourself. It comes with a bunch of extra parts as pictured. **$190 + Shipping or Trades**

Hey guys I have a one-off Green Southpaw Fullsized. This was a prototype that was never offered during the groupbuy. Due to it being a prototype, there is some ano discoloration and some scratches on the inside of the case, but overally I think it's in good condition, please reference the pics and ask any questions tho.

Built with lubed NK Creams and lubed, filmed, band-aid modded genuine gmk screw-in stabs. 

I have around 550 into the board, but I am asking 450 shipped (prioirty usps shipping). Prefer conus, but if an international buyer wants it, I'll split shipping costs.",[US-MO] [H] One-off Green Southpaw Fullsized with Lubed Creams [W] Paypal

Hi MM,

I was going to use these for a keyboard build but decided not to use these caps since it won’t really match with what I want. They are still sealed and not opened. I’ll be delivering it using the same NK box. CONUS only please! Will ship them out on Monday. It may get to you next week after the holidays!

What's up everyone!

I hope you're all doing great! I have a couple of things for your consideration today but first, a quick word:

&nbsp;

※ All prices are *OBO* meaning that I'll accept lower offers, feel free to negotiate, not that I want higher offers - no need to PM me for something that's pending or gone and try to offer more.

※ Prices include PP fees but don't include shipping (USA should be roughly $40, Canada is a little more, PM me for confirmation);

※ **Should we trade, please keep the declared valued under $20, my country is a bitch in Custom fees (€30 flat + 21% of the total value (items + shipping))**.

###Epilogue

After searching far and wide, like Ash Ketchum, I was able to secure my grail board - Jane V2 CE; After acquiring the grail, I thought that it would be best to trim down my current collection.

Noxary 268.2 in clear polycarbonate, 5mm brass plate, super heavy brass weight, spare brand new PCB and one millmaxed hotswap pcb with a couple jumped traces. Works great, sounds great.

Decided to sell off some things to fund my umpteenth guitar.

1: Black Vega with alu plate. Will be disassembled before selling, built once in its current form. Only ""flaw"" is that I had to sand down one set of the stab spacers because they wouldn't fit with the durock stabs I was using. The board comes with two full sets so this shouldn't matter, but I felt it should be disclosed. $600 shipped CONUS

2: Project Nautilus SM custom keyboard: Set has been pared down to just the board and GMK nautilus base set. Can also throw in the deskmat if you want it, just pay the additional shipping. ""SMKeyboard case, H87A PCB flashed with VIA, 67g Koala switches painted yellow, lubed with Krytox 204, springs with Krytox GPL105. Blue c3-equalz-screw-in-stabilizers lubed and bandaid, Copper plate is patina."" Extra images from original sales thread below. Board looks the same except for lack of extra nautilus sets, and keycaps are significantly smoother. Can take extra pictures upon request. $420 shipped CONUS [OG Images](https://imgur.com/a/ezPOO8W)

~~3: Black Hotswap Tofu60 kit + MKUltra plate foam. Built in once, in perfect condition. Comes with lightly lubed snap in stabs. Has the arrow key layout with full left shift and right shift where the question mark key should be. (The hotswap kit available on kbdfans right now) $140 shipped CONUS~~ SOLD

Hi r/mechmarket,

I have the following sets for sale, prices do not include shipping.

I am looking to donate some cash from this sale to a local cat rescuer, can view her instagram at [.@fioloh](https://www.instagram.com/fioloh/?hl=en). She has been helping many stray cats find homes, sent to vets for surgeries, etc and I found her work really meaningful (especially because I like cats). Hence, I'll state 2 prices (just $10 difference), if you would like to help, you can opt to purchase the slightly more expensive price, it's perfectly okay if you don't want to. The donation will be publicly recorded at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asY5BAWSZ_pmxUy2jxmaSa1eHDddTiLQlEhGi1niuyw/edit#gid=1722981492), under tehbingg. I'll update here once donated. (I hope this is allowed by the mods, otherwise please let me know, I'll be willing to remove.)

This would not be FCFS as I would like to prioritize the donation prices to help a little more.

That being said, here are the kits:

|Kits (all sealed)|Price (US$)|Availability|

This lil guy has been through a lot. Bought it off a redditor like 3 months ago, was lost in shipping, and finally made its way into my hands.

Includes the stock stabs that comes with it and a plate/pcb stupidfish foam i had lying around.  ~~Looking for $260 shipped in original box~~ **SOLLLLD**

Selling some stuff I've decided I don't like or need anymore.

~~Polycarb Candybar Premium - $235 + shipping. I've decided I'm not a fan of 40% layouts or polycarbonate plates. This has both. Used for less than a week, this is for just the kit + plate + pcb, no keys or switches. I'd be willing to bundle things at a slight discount if you were interested in those too though.~~ SOLD

Pebble - $240 + shipping. SA Miami keycaps, Tangerine switches. This was my workhouse for quite a while and has some scuffs on the plate from taking switches in and out. Has brass plate and weight. Hotswappable PCB. This one includes the switches and keycaps.

~~Drop Ctrl - $100 80 + shipping. This one comes with some white pudding keycaps I got off Amazon but I forgot to take a picture of them. I'll also throw in either the set of halo trues or navy blues for the keyboard so you have a fully functioning keyboard. Sorry switches sold so I've reduced the price of this to compensate. I also happened to find the original box and keycaps this morning so I will throw those in at no additional cost.~~ SOLD

~~Drop Alt - $135 + shipping. This comes with the GMK Red samurai keycaps but no switches. If you want switches I'd be willing to bundle one of the sets I have for a slight discount.~~ SOLD

~~Kuro Shiro + Rama Keys - $270 shipped. In great condition, only very lightly used.~~ SOLD

~~62x Invyr Holy Pandas - $55 shipped. These were originally in the Pebble when I bought it.~~ SOLD

~~87x Clipped Sakurios - $65 shipped.~~ SOLD

~~87x Halo Trues - $35 shipped, or free with the Ctrl keyboard.~~ SOLD

~~90x Box Navy Blue Switches - $20 shipped, or free with the Ctrl keyboard.~~ SOLD

hi mechmarket, I'm here again with my Mode Eighty, along with some other things

CONUS buyers only, please

Not looing for trades at this moment, need more liquid assets since I'm hoping to build a new PC

Local buyers strongly preferred, especially for the keyboards

**Mode Eighty First Edition - Light**

Here we go again. The pre-order is still mostly available, and if you can wait until January, you will probably be better off getting that and saving a good chunk of change. However, if you happen to really dig the look of the First Edition, I have a Light one that I'm selling for less than the $701.51 total that I paid. Comes with everything, keyboard has not been taken out of the paper wrapper.

~~Asking $666.66 + shipping~~ SOLD

**Vulcan Maja - Dark Green**

Hotswap

Comes with everything

~~Asking $555.55 shipped~~ SOLD

**GMK Peach Blossom Base**

I have made the decision to apply for a masters in environmental history, so will be taking a break from keyboard purchasing and will be letting go of most of my collection in preparation for postgraduate fees. This sale is not FCFS, I will be prioritising bundles, local deals, people I have traded with before, as well as those with verified paypals, and people who have trade history. Due to the ongoing pandemic sales are CONUS only.

I will be using USPS Priority mail. It is projected that the Boston-area will be getting a lot of snow tomorrow, so there is a great chance that I will not be able to go to the post office until Friday.

I am open to negotiating prices, though will be prioritising those who meet my asking price. **EVERYTHING MUST GO.** comment before pming! No chat please.

After almost a year to get all the parts for my project, it doesn't really correspond to my expectations anymore.

The GMK Oblivion v2 set has been opened for one single assembly, directly removed, the same for the Oblivion Cadet set as well as for the RAMA WORKS keycap. All three are therefore new.

I really like this keyboard, hoping it'll go to a good home where it gets more use! I'm asking for **£375** + shipping. 

It's a Drop Alt Laser from the original run (LE serial number pictured). It's in great condition apart from the ding on the front right corner which I've taken a close up of. The PCB also has one socket which has been replaced and connected with jump wire (still fully functional including hotswap capability).  
It's built with lubed+filmed speed silvers which sound pretty good IMO. I've tuned the stabs as well (but as they're plate-mounted they can't quite reach the same level as PCB-mount screw-in stabs).   

Keycaps are GMK Plum base kit, lightly used, maybe a tiny amount of shine on some alphas. Can ship in original trays (the good ones made of hard plastic).  

I made the cable myself with shielded 24/24 AWG wire, it works for me with the RGB as in the photo, and I've used the USB passthrough to a numpad as well. (But the Drop Alt can be finicky, so I can't guarantee this will work with every setup.)  

Thanks for looking!","[EU-UK] [H] Drop Alt Laser, GMK Plum [W] Paypal"

**BOARDS**

CandyBar premium in white, comes with cable, PCB, poly plate, original box, never built- **$325** shipped

Noxary 268.2 in clear polycarbonate, 5mm brass plate, super heavy brass weight, spare brand new PCB and one millmaxed hotswap pcb with a couple small jumps. Works great, sounds great. Plate and weight have tarnish and case has some small imperfections. PC has a few hairlines around screws and screw tappings don’t “lock” the screws so well anymore so there are some minor things like that. With that in mind, price is ~~$425~~ **$400** shipped, way below GB price.

~~This is my SC alice. Used for about a month and a half. Team mechlovin black pcb (all RGB underglow works). GMK Screw in stabs lubed with 205g0 and dielectric grease. Has mauves lubed with 205g0 and TX filmed. I have 67g tangies, and i gotta admit the mauves are far smoother and thoccier. I even tried overlubing the tangies to achieve the thocc the mauves have, but no cigar. I bought it brand new and had it built from the ground up from a user on here. During the building process, he accidentally hit the clear bottom near a screwhole with a tool. It is a super small scuff, can't be seen, and has no effect on durability. Comes with the clear bottom(already installed, can be swapped out upon request), black acrylic feet, and the extra hardware. It will be shipped securely in its respective box with plenty of bubble wrap. Asking $340 shipped OBO.~~

[~~GMK Darling & Spacebars~~](https://imgur.com/a/eYGnzRA) **SOLD FOR 400 SHIPPED BOTH KITS**

~~I got lucky with extras. I took out the base kit and mounted it on my alice for photos. Used for about an hour or 2 after the photos, which i then decided to put the caps back in the trays. They have absolutely ZERO shine. I only unsealed the bottom spacebars for my alice, which i only mounted for photos as well. Asking $400 shipped in bags and $415 shipped in trays for both.~~

~~I'm willing to split the kits, but it'll be $360 shipped in bags for the base and $370 shipped in trays. Spacebars will be $65 shipped.~~

**Rama U80-A - MILK - HOT-SWAP**

[Detailed pictures](https://imgur.com/a/Xl2Ueye) (from last sale attempt)

I bought this keyboard from mechmarket several months ago. It is by far one of my favorites that I have ever owned however, I recently received several others and feel it's time to move on. It has durock stabs and I have mounted 2 different sets of switches into it. There is almost no blemishes on the white part of the case but the mirror finished back-weight does have some scratches. There are pictures of the whole keyboard from every angle and close ups in the timestamp. I have an extra silicone dampener and it already has one included. I also have ALL of the original packaging. I paid $1400 opened, but unassembled. **-------------- $1200 plus shipping --------------------**

**KBDfans E-White Tofu 60**

Dz60 (layout in pictures), Brass plate, sorbothane under PCB, durock stabs, MX blacks 205g0, non-hotswap. This one of my first keyboards and I love it, but I never use it. Time to pass it along. Near Perfect condition.  **-------------- $200 plus shipping --------------------**

**GMK Merlin + Wizard novelties** 

Bought this set more recently with my U80-a, I have no need for it anymore now that I am selling my u80-a. Great shape, have only been mounted twice. **-------------- $260 plus shipping --------------------**

**GMK Zhuyin**

Never used, but opened. Still not entirely sure I want to get rid of as I am waiting on GMK minimal. If someone is will to pay $160 plus shipping, I would be willing to part with this set.

Dug through my box of kb components and came across my harvested Topre domes. 

I believe these OG Sony BKE domes are somewhere within the range of 45g to 55g weight. Despite the color differences, the weight feels similar to me. 

Sorry I haven't used any of the BKE Redux domes to compare against the OG Sony domes.

For the consistency of all domes being sourced from a single donor board, I will only sell the OG Sony BKE domes in sets of either 60x domes or 66x domes.

Album [https://flic.kr/s/aHsmSKa5gR](https://flic.kr/s/aHsmSKa5gR)

Looking to trade for a nice 60% board (or other TKL - Although I love the board, I'm not as big of an rgb fan as I thought). Open to offers. Otherwise this bad boy is up for sell.

Asking for $950+ shipping OBO

About the board:

Comes with 2 builds - currently installed is an fr4 snow pro combo built with lubed  and filmed retooled blacks with sprit 63.5 progressive springs. Gmk lubed stabs. All LEDs work on the snopro pcb.

The second build is Stainless Steel plate on stock pcb with lubed mint holy pandas. Durock lubed stabs. Did not get to finish soldering LED on this board as I did not purchase them. 

The case was originally silver but was cerakoted with stormtrooper white.  The finish turned out great considering how difficult white is to use. I  have had it for a week now after having it painted but I’ve gotten too  used to smaller boards and no longer have use for this. Comes with brass  internal weight.

Detailed photos can be found in the album.

Can desolder switches for a discount but would prefer to bundle as I would have no use for them.

Looking to offload some things before the holidays. Prices are OBO, preference to bundles. Shipped prices are CONUS. Can ship internationally for extra. Switches can't be confirmed for trade cred due to bulk rules. If you have any interesting 40% builds for trade shoot me an offer! Thanks for looking and have a happy holiday season!

**KBDfans TFV2 HHKB (Black):**

In very good condition. The brass plate is removeable. Includes original hardware, extra daughterboard, foam between the board and PCB, DIY cut foam between PCB and plate, and stock GMK stabs. The stabs aren't installed because I was using a different set. The bottom brass weight has some slight imperfections/light scratches that came from factory. There's some blemish on the underside of the top-half of the case. Only visible when board is taken apart. You will see in the photos.

$265 shipped to CONUS

**Holy YOK Polar Pandas x70:**

Made with Halo Clear stems and YOK Polar Panda housing. The springs are Sprit 68g gold plated. 60 of the switches are lightly lubed with Krytox 204 (I avoided the legs). These switches were used on the KBDFans TFV2 HHKB. 10 of the switches are unlubed.

$90 shipped to CONUS

**Unholy Pandas x70:**

Leftover parts. Halo Clear housing and spring. YOK Panda linear stem.

$20 shipped to CONUS

Hi all,

This is a Space65: CyberVoyager in the Schrodinger color.  It is a cream color, reminds me of the RAMA soya color.  It has a lime green badge, and a camping green weight.  I think this will pair really well with GMK Camping keyset.  I am including some extras such as the noise reduction pad, LED badge collector, and an extra PCB.

Price includes shipping and Paypal fees.

Shipping is done through USPS First Class Mail with tracking for the Continental US. Preference is Continental US.  Because of the current pandemic, I am trying to avoid international shipping at this time.

Hello again! I am purging keebs/sets/things I won't be using. Trying to gather money to build a new PC :)

Item descriptions and prices below!

Item | Description | Price/Avail
---|---|----
~~Key65 Gasket Mount Polycarbonate Hotswap + White Kanji Weight~~| ~~Board is in great condition, no noticeable scuffs as far as I can tell. Board is optioned out at WKL, no badge, and White Kanji weight on the back. Comes with hotswap pcb, aluminum plate, plate foam/rubber, lubed durock v1 stabs. It's quite a pleasant board, but a new desktop build is on the horizon for me. Keycaps and switches not included. Can provide more pictures if requested.~~| ~~**$620 shipped OBO** in original packaging ~~OR **bundle w/ GMK Oblivion for $820 shipped OBO**~~~~
~~GMK Oblivion Regular Base Kit~~ | ~~Lovely keycap set, but it's time for it to go. Great condition on alphas/spacebars/all the keys. There is ONE flaw that I have found; the left shift key has a minor bit of shine and some sort of ding on the lower left portion. The ding is **not visible** when mounted in board. The shine is visible from certain angles. Can send more pics if you would like.~~ | ~~**$230 shipped in bags**, bundle with Key65 for $200 :)~~ **Sold for asking**
~~PBT Islander Base Kit + Fix Kit + Novelties + Extensions~~| ~~Literally every kit offered haha. Mounted on my Sesame for show only, used it very minimally (maybe 1 hour total?). Prefer not to split, but can if buyers are found for each kit. Will ship out in all original packaging. Discounted if shipped in bags. Keyboard not included obviously.~~| ~~**$250 shipped** It's hard to price this out cause I rarely see anyone selling all the kits together (only other listing I found was $310+ship which feels excessive).~~ **SOLD for $235 shipped**
~~White Duckboard R2~~|~~Unbuilt/brand new. Planned to build it but I think that I'll have my hands full with other soldering projects. R3 will be happening in January, but if you don't want to wait then here is your chance!~~| ~~**$70 shipped**~~ **Sold for asking**

I only ship **CONUS / Canada (for extra fee)**, can do US proxies but you assume the risks. Can do local pickup 95377 if you would like a small discount. I can also bundle in switches into the Key65 purchase if you would like (not much selection, but if someone wants a keyboard + keycap + switch bundle, I'd be happy to dig into my collection). I love to bundle anyway haha.

|Bauer R1 Alu|$2050|This was originally an A-stock board configured as a silver top, grey plate, grey base. Unfortunately, some of the cerakote “rubbed off” in transit due to friction between the silver and the packaging materials. I had it cerakoted to be all black, including the alu plate. There is one surface-level mark (would be easily fixed with another cerakote job) visible on the right side of the board - would not say it is visible in use, but not everyone’s set up is the same, so YMMV. Currently built with a millmaxed PCB + Gateron Ink V1s lubed with 205g0 by AshKeebs. If you wish, I can include the switches + the caps (oblivion monochrome, hagoromo alphas) at no additional cost. This will include 1 additional PCB and any of the extra plates (PC, POM, brass) in the photo album will be available at no extra charge, subject to availability.  I would prefer to allow one buyer to grab PC OR POM, and not both, so both can experience a softer typing experience if they wish to do so.|[https://imgur.com/a/NErSTo8](https://imgur.com/a/NErSTo8)|

The only imperfections I can see are some cerakote  flaws (you can see some surface-level scratches in “bad” light at specific angles - I apologize for the lack of photos as it is hard to pick up on camera), as well as some interior machining marks on the brass bottom. This will include 2 PCBs and any of the extra plates (PC, POM, brass) in the photo album will be available at no extra charge, subject to availability.

**BOARDS**

Candy bar premium in white, comes with cable,  pcb, poly plate, original box, never built- $325 shipped

Noxary 268.2 in clear polycarbonate, 5mm brass plate, super heavy brass weight, spare brand new PCB and one millmaxed hotswap pcb with a couple small jumps. Works great, sounds great. Plate and weight have tarnish and case has some small imperfections. PC has a tendency to crack and screw tappings don’t “lock” the screws so well anymore so there are some minor things like that. With that in mind, price is $425 shipped, cheaper than GB total.

Someone more technically inclined might be able to make it work. Works just fine using a cabled connection though! One switch is jumped due to a faulty pad. The case has a few dings and scratches. Soldered with Cherry MX Silent Black stems in Aliaz Bottoms, Outemu no wobble tops, TX 70g springs lubed with TX oil, switches lubed with Tribosys3204, Stabs are GMK pre-tool screw-ins lubed with Superlube.

PCB works like new with all lights and functions. I also collected most of the badges so there are 11 in total. Comes installed with the acrylic badge.

In very good condition. The brass plate is removeable. Includes original hardware, extra daughterboard, foam between the board and PCB, DIY cut foam between PCB and plate, and stock GMK stabs. The stabs aren't installed because I was using a different set. The bottom brass weight has some slight imperfections/light scratches that came from factory. There's some blemish on the underside of the top-half of the case. Only visible when board is taken apart. You will see in the photos.

###FAQ
1. Which parts of the switch do I lube?  
> Bottom housing (rails, center post, bottom)  
> Stem (all sides and legs) - tactile legs NOT lubed  
>
> [Work Station & Example of Lubing](https://imgur.com/a/HreuCIa)  
> **20,000+ switches lubed**
> 
> ***Disclaimer: Unless otherwise stated, factory lube is not removed prior to modifications. YMMV.***

2. What is 205g2+105 and how does it compare to 205g0?    
>  205g2+105 is a 1:1 mixture of 205g2 and 105 commonly used among Korean keyboard enthusiasts, popular Youtuber [:3ildcat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeHOkFGW-7uAZFvq3BXb8YA), and sold by [TX Keyboards](https://www.us.txkeyboards.com/products/krytox-lube?variant=31403083825212). The result is a mixture with a consistency very similar to 205g0, which is a mixture of 105 and PTFE powder.

I have a lightly used (Almost full set) of GMK Jamon. Condition is lightly used, there is some shine on some keys but it’s pretty hard to see (refer to images for more pics) 

Comes with:
-	GMK Jamon Core
-	Jamonelties
-	Numpad 
-	Pata Negra (?)

I am considering keeping the Pata Negra, so I will have 2 prices here depending on the bundle. I am also going to keep one egg keycap. The Jamonelties comes with 2 eggs, so there will still be one left.

Hi Everyone! 

I'm selling a few things before I move and funding a couple of things. All prices include shipping in the continental US and will ship the next business day. If you're outside of the continental US, send me a DM and I'll be happy to look into shipping rates.

Item descriptions and prices below!

Item | Description | Price/Avail
---|---|----
~~Key65 Gasket Mount Polycarbonate Hotswap + White Kanji Weight~~| ~~Board is in great condition, no noticeable scuffs as far as I can tell. Board is optioned out at WKL, no badge, and White Kanji weight on the back. Comes with hotswap pcb, aluminum plate, plate foam/rubber, lubed durock v1 stabs. It's quite a pleasant board, but a new desktop build is on the horizon for me. Keycaps and switches not included. Can provide more pictures if requested.~~| ~~**$620 shipped OBO** in original packaging ~~OR **bundle w/ GMK Oblivion for $820 shipped OBO**~~~~
GMK Oblivion Regular Base Kit | Lovely keycap set, but it's time for it to go. Great condition on alphas/spacebars/all the keys. There is ONE flaw that I have found; the left shift key has a minor bit of shine and some sort of ding on the lower left portion. The ding is **not visible** when mounted in board. The shine is visible from certain angles. | **$240 shipped in bags** (was going to list for $250, but reduced price by $10 for the left shift ""issues"".
~~OLKB White Hotswap Planck Hi-Pro~~ | ~~Again, a lovely board but I just don't use it enough. I got [the (now sold out) case](https://olkb.com/products/planck-hi-pro-bottom?variant=31558699679778) from OLKB for $65 + $15 for the hi-pro aluminum plate. A planck rev6 pcb is about $55 on drop, so totals out to roughly $130. The best part of this build is the case, it's quite lovely. Includes keycaps + a nice GMK stab (not sure if pretool but it's really nice), no switches.~~ | ~~**$140 shipped** ($130 for keeb + $10 shipping roughly).~~ **SOLD For $130 Local**

I only ship **CONUS / Canada**, can do US proxies but you assume the risks. Can do local pickup 95377 if you would like a small discount. I can also bundle in switches into either purchase if you would like (not much selection, but if someone wants a keyboard + keycap + switch bundle, I'd be happy to dig into my collection).

I am selling a TKL resin wrist rest I just made. It has not been used, only posed for photos on my instagram. There are some minor blemishes on the top that are only visible if you look very close in the right lighting. The bottom of the rest has been sanded but it is not visible at all when it is on your desk. It is a white pearl with subtle black swirl. **$60 + Shipping or trades**

I am selling / trading my SM Keyboards butterstick with a faulty PCB. The PCB might be repairable if you know your way around it. It is transparent purple and blue acrylic. I would prefer to add this in as part of a trade, but I might also be willing to sell it. **$50 + Shipping or trades**

Up for trade is my White POM Iris Rev 4. It has been built with lubed NK Blueberries. It has only been used for a couple of hours and just isn't for me. The only thing worth noting is that I did need to make some cuts on the bottom plate to make the pcb fit properly (See pics for details) but keep in mind it comes with two brand new plates if you would prefer to make the cuts yourself. It comes with a bunch of extra parts as pictured. **$220 + Shipping or Trades**

~~I am selling my e-white tmo50v2. This board is in mint condition, but its been in its case for months because i'm not a huge tactile fan and its a bit chonky for a forty, it deserves to be typed on or displayed. That being said, I've made hps out of yoks and used the drop ones as well, and I prefer the franken ones in this board personally. Mostly because they can have films so they have a beautiful clack and are smooth in the ink housings. Also all the mods on this bad boy are linearized,  just personal preference. This was my grail board for a while and i'm glad to have had it, it really is a work of art.~~ **KEEPING**",[US-FL] [H] E-White TMO50v2 [W] PayPal

SOLD FOR ASKING: Keycult No1 - $1500 - I purchased this unit in 2018 from their brief sale on Typemachina. It is a green board with full brass weight. Included are the stock PCB it came with that has been desoldered and a brass and FR4 plate. There are some slight discoloration spots on the brass plate and some tarnishing on the sides of the internal brass weight - otherwise the board is in good condition and has a very unique color for Keycult.

Weaven - $400 - Comes in a black and red configuration with the stock PCB. The top plate has been modified from ISO layout to ANSI. No major flaws and goes together well.

HHKB Pro2 - $225 - Black HHKB Pro2 with a red esc key. Has been lubed and has Deskeys #5 silencing rings installed with BKE Light domes. The stock domes are included.

Mitchcapped HHKB Mods - $90 - Black and purple HHKB mods with a slight sparkle.

Selling the board that got me into the hobby. I dropped it like an absolute idiot so I tried to capture the marks in the pictures. There are two dents on the top left edge and a few on the bottom front edge. You can only see the top left dents when the board is on the table, but I lowered the price to hopefully reflect the damage. The stabs are gmk clipped and lubed.

###FAQ
1. Which parts of the switch do I lube?  
> Bottom housing (rails, center post, bottom)  
> Stem (all sides and legs) - tactile legs NOT lubed  
>
> [Work Station & Example of Lubing](https://imgur.com/a/HreuCIa)  
> **20,000+ switches lubed**
> 
> ***Disclaimer: Unless otherwise stated, factory lube is not removed prior to modifications. YMMV.***

2. What is 205g2+105 and how does it compare to 205g0?    
>  205g2+105 is a 1:1 mixture of 205g2 and 105 commonly used among Korean keyboard enthusiasts, popular Youtuber [:3ildcat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeHOkFGW-7uAZFvq3BXb8YA), and sold by [TX Keyboards](https://www.us.txkeyboards.com/products/krytox-lube?variant=31403083825212). The result is a mixture with a consistency very similar to 205g0, which is a mixture of 105 and PTFE powder.

Album: https://imgur.com/gallery/RFtk1Yt

I have a lightly used (Almost full set) of GMK Jamon. Condition is lightly used, there is some shine on some keys but it’s pretty hard to see (refer to images for more pics) 

Comes with:
-	GMK Jamon Core
-	Jamonelties
-	Numpad 
-	Pata Negra (?)

I am considering keeping the Pata Negra, so I will have 2 prices here depending on the bundle. I am also going to keep one egg keycap. The Jamonelties comes with 2 eggs, so there will still be one left. 

Ships in Trays with the original box:

Price for everything (including Pata Negra): $450 + Shipping 
Price WITHOUT Pata Negra: $400 + Shipping

Will prioritize a local sale. I am not super comfortable with trading outright, so if you had an Olivia we can discuss logistics + additional cash if needed. 

As for the Olivia, I want a light kit, doesn’t have to be brand new, but preferably no shine. It would be Olivia or Olive PLUS cash depending on bundle","[US-WA] [H] GMK Jamon, Jamonelties, Num Pad, Pata Negra(?) [W] PayPal, Olivia Light, Olive"

Hi all, it's that time of year where I need to clear out some space in my collection. More images can be provided upon request. Sales are not FCFS, bundles encouraged.

You can also reach me at NRbigfoot#5714 on discord


I'm also interested in **trading N:1 +/-PP for or purchasing artisans from the bottom image of the timestamp**. I will also look at other offers, worst I can say is no. Trades can be +/- paypal.

I prefer to ship within CONUS, shipping not included in prices, $5 shipping for artisans. Bundles will be prioritized and discounted with each additional item.

Please comment before PM and please do not use chat, it never seems to work on my end. Thanks for looking!

Need to move some stuff for money for Christmas:

NCR G81-3000 case and *doubleshot* keycaps, built with Chili G80 replacement PCB. This board runs QMK and I added VIA support. Has SIP socketed LED indicators, currently have white installed. 70g Aliaz switches throughout, swapped to MX Cherry spring on spacebar. Clipped Cherry stabilizers. Works beautifully, and I doubt you'll see another modernized NCR board like this. Model number on case is G81-3007HAU, keycaps are original to case and are NCR colorway, not OG beige. ~~$350 shipped.~~ $250 shipped.

YMDK 84 kit: 75% layout. Bootmapper PCB with USB-C connector. 70g Aliaz switches, swapped to MX Cherry spring on spacebar. Clipped Cherry stabilizers. Keycaps not included. $150 shipped.

Drop XDA Canvas keycaps. ""Full kit"", listed on Drop as 1800 kit. Has a coverage for a lot of layouts since it's not sculpted. $75 shipped. All keys are included, a number of them are mounted on the YMDK.

GMK SoWaRe. Mounted for display, never used. $150 shipped in bags, $175 shipped in GMK plastic tray.

I really like this keyboard, hoping it'll go to a good home where it gets more use! I'm asking for **£385** + shipping. 

It's a Drop Alt Laser from the original run (LE serial number pictured). It's in great condition apart from the ding on the front right corner which I've taken a close up of. The PCB also has one socket which has been replaced and connected with jump wire (still fully functional including hotswap capability).  
It's built with lubed+filmed speed silvers which sound pretty good IMO. I've tuned the stabs as well (but as they're plate-mounted they can't quite reach the same level as PCB-mount screw-in stabs).   

Keycaps are GMK Plum base kit, lightly used, maybe a tiny amount of shine on some alphas. Can ship in original trays (the good ones made of hard plastic).  

I made the cable myself with shielded 24/24 AWG wire, it works for me with the RGB as in the photo, and I've used the USB passthrough to a numpad as well. (But the Drop Alt can be finicky, so I can't guarantee this will work with every setup. However in all these cases the keyboard still works, just without RGB.)

Hi Guys,

Unloading somethings to make space for all these GBs. Apologies if some of these prices are too much. Trying to recover what I paid for but please feel free to PM me to work something out. Bundle items for a discount

This was an impulse buy and its brand new. Note: it is still available on NovelKeys for $115 + Shipping and tax.

**Take the below keyboards for $105 Shipped** OBO?

**~~Razer Huntsman TE -60 Shipped OBO~~**

Bought this used and there is some gloss on the WASD keys. Has Razer's red switches. Condition is really good otherwise

**~~GMMK Compact - $62 Shipped OBO~~**

This is the 2019 version of the keyboard, so no updated stabs or Type C. Bought this barebones. Has lubed Gateron Silent Reds and the stock stabs are also lubed. I have a custom coiled cable that has a Micro-USB end for this keyboard that will be included for free. Note: the space bar has a glorious panda switch but I can replace it with the gateron red. I can toss in some keycaps if you want but theyre pretty faded

**NOT FCFS, Local or bundles will be priority**

I can consider board trades but you have to offer paypal because I need the money for some other projects outside of keyboards preferably.

There are a some knicks on the anno of the Xeno as noted in the Timestamp. Additionally, there is one bridged pin on the pcb.

Please understand however that this will take a while and that there is no guarantee of replacements from GMK who review the issue on a case by case basis (see explanation in link).~~

~~Lubed with 205g0 on the bottom housing (side rails and post) and all sides of the stem. Springs lubed with 105 oil. For those who are new, these are unused and will still sound a bit scratchy until they are ""broken in"" i.e. typed on for a while.~~

**~~90x Lubed and Filmed Gat Ink Blacks v2 - AUD$140~~** SOLD for $120

~~68 of these have been used in my daily driver for the past month or so. Lubed with 205g0 on bottom housing (side rails and post) and all sides of the stem. Springs lubed with 105 oil. Filmed with Deskeys black films. Note that about 10 of the 68 used switches have slightly bent top housings from being pulled from tight plates. I've carefully moved them back into place but you can still see the difference. Functionally, I can't personally feel any difference but they obviously look aesthetically different to the undamaged ones. The price reflects these 10 switches included at half price.~~

I am interested in trading for the followings: 1) Rama Koyu, Matrix 2.0, Sat75, can add money if needed. 2) GMK Rudy, Olivia light as well and can work in as part of the deal. So send me an offer.

All prices in USD. PM to find out shipping cost (usually it will be under $10 for UPS ground if not too heavy, keyboards will be more). If buy in a bundle can save on shipping. No refund or exchange P.S. I have recently met a very non-sense and demanding buyer making trouble, so I have to put this here to protect myself. Normally this never is an issue.

###FAQ
1. Which parts of the switch do I lube?  
> Bottom housing (rails, center post, bottom)  
> Stem (all sides and legs) - tactile legs NOT lubed  
>
> [Work Station & Example of Lubing](https://imgur.com/a/HreuCIa)  
> **20,000+ switches lubed**
> 
> ***Disclaimer: Unless otherwise stated, factory lube is not removed prior to modifications. YMMV.***

2. What is 205g2+105 and how does it compare to 205g0?    
>  205g2+105 is a 1:1 mixture of 205g2 and 105 commonly used among Korean keyboard enthusiasts, popular Youtuber [:3ildcat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeHOkFGW-7uAZFvq3BXb8YA), and sold by [TX Keyboards](https://www.us.txkeyboards.com/products/krytox-lube?variant=31403083825212). The result is a mixture with a consistency very similar to 205g0, which is a mixture of 105 and PTFE powder.

3. Switch sales cannot be confirmed as per r/mechmarket rules

Bought too many things. For shipping, I would suggest local post (cheaper, and have shipped once without issue), but if you'd like FedEx/DHL, I can also try to quote. Though note that I will not be responsible for shipment issues after handing the item to the courier, so choose only shipping methods you're confident in.

**SOLD OUT**

Hope everyone's December is off to a good start! I've got some extra FR4 plates from a recent batch I had made that I am looking to sell now.

They are from JLCPCB with a custom silkscreen that says HEX.3C to match the board...had help from a friend to design in, his logo is the vanilla cone there under the spacebar.

***DISCLOSURE***

These plates have been modified slightly. They were cut with the incorrect height dimensions for the stabilizer holes and thus did not allow the spacebar and enter keys to return to full height. I took a Dremel to the holes today to expand them and tested each to make sure they work. Just know that the stab holes are not the prettiest thing to look at...(you can see what I'm talking about in the timestamp)

they are all fixed tsangan layout, which you can see in the timestamp. There is also a typing test with GMK keycaps and JWK stems in Milky Gateron housings.

Asking $12 shipped (SOLD OUT) per plate to the US and I have 2 left. Thanks!",[US-OH][H]Hex.3c FR4 Plates [W] Paypal

Album: https://imgur.com/gallery/RFtk1Yt

I have a lightly used (Almost full set) of GMK Jamon. Condition is lightly used, there is some shine on some keys but it’s pretty hard to see (refer to images for more pics) 

Comes with:
-	GMK Jamon Core
-	Jamonelties
-	Numpad 
-	Pata Negra (?)

I am considering keeping the Pata Negra, so I will have 2 prices here depending on the bundle. I am also going to keep one egg keycap. The Jamonelties comes with 2 eggs, so there will still be one left. 

Ships in Trays with the original box:

Price for everything (including Pata Negra): $450 + Shipping 
Price WITHOUT Pata Negra: $400 + Shipping

Will prioritize a local sale. I am not super comfortable with trading outright, so if you had an Olivia we can discuss logistics + additional cash if needed. 

As for the Olivia, I want a light kit, doesn’t have to be brand new, but preferably no shine. It would be Olivia PLUS cash depending on bundle","[US-WA] [H] GMK Jamon, Jamonelties, Numpad, Pata Negra (?) [W] PayPal, GMK Olivia"

Excellent condition. Came from KBDfans with a small nick near the screwhole (see album). Otherwise, everything is essentially brand new.

The sockets are not soldered - they were fitted very tightly and did not need to be soldered, but if you would like then I can solder them in. Works perfectly. Caps are not included.

Hey /r/mechmarket, I've been making commisioned cables for a few months now with 30+ satisfied customers and so I've decided to brand myself as **Curlicue Cables**! This is Batch One of my **ready-to-ship cables.**

&nbsp;

So many people are making cables these days, and I've noticed prices for keycap-inspired cables that are just *too damn high*, anywhere from $70-$100, with a lead time of several months, GB-style! Nobody likes to wait, which is why I'm making themed cables at affordable prices in large batches, **ready-to-ship.**

&nbsp;

**My cable process:** USB2.0-spec shielded cable is sleeved with high-quality paracord and double-sleeved with genuine Flexo-PET Techflex for quality and durability. Once sleeved, Cables are coiled at 3/8"" using Zap Coil Collars (no tape!) and oven baked at 210F, freezed to cool, baked and cooled once more, and reverse-coiled for a [springy, quality coil](https://imgur.com/ojWIwWZ). That's a total of **three heat/cool cycles**, one more than most vendors! [Connections are soldered](https://imgur.com/fyEYGJA) at 300 degrees using Kester 63/37 leaded solder, and heatshrink applied carefully with a heat-gun.

Cable Colorway |  Qty. Remaining | Price | Description
------------------|--------------|------------------|-------
[Clean White](https://imgur.com/VJidmUU) |  2 | $50 | For those who want a clean, simple cable that matches with anything
[Water](https://imgur.com/lwW2rUC) | 0 | $50 | Color-matched with a certain popular set, Mizu
[Lunar Rover **B-Stock**](https://imgur.com/93Y7TmW) | 1 | ~~$25~~ $15 | This cable is built from [Zap's Old-School cable](https://zapcables.com/custom-old-school-retractable-cable/), which is a rubber, non-sleeved material. This type of cable can be [stretched and is much more durable than normal coils](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFfo8-XHk_O/). [GMK Lunar-themed](https://thekey.company/products/gmk-lunar), cable has some visible [tooling](https://imgur.com/D5dNG9r) [marks](https://imgur.com/jKImltt) but functions normally. 8-inch coil. This is personally my favorite type of cable, and this is a great price to try one out for yourself.
*Shipping $6 CONUS* in a [8""x8"" box, shipped securely in a bubble-wrapped sleeve](https://imgur.com/LFwpoe5).

&nbsp;

*If you are planning to use one of these cables with a high-demand board like an HHKB, CTRL, or ALT, it may not power the board properly. I unfortunately do not have any of these boards on hand for testing.*

&nbsp;

There will be one more batch of these cables in these colorways.","[US-IN][H] Curlicue Cables | White & Blue Coiled + Detachable Cables, Ready to Ship [W] PayPal"

Hello, I'm looking to sell the GMK darling extras from Black Friday, wanted to get the base + novelties but wasn't fast enough for it and not interested anymore in the set so I'm selling what I got. 

Everything is brand new, sealed as shown on the timestamp. Tried to fix the keys from going all over the trays but no luck but it’s sealed so nothing is affected.

GMK Darling Spacebars $62 + shipping - Sold locally to a friend

GMK Extensions - $53 + shipping (cheaper than novelkeys, I'm taking a loss on this) - Sold locally to a friend

From what I've seen so far in mech market for these items, my prices are pretty fair.

I prefer Paypal but am open to trades. **NOT** FCFS. *DMing me with Paypal email and buying for asking price guarantees you the item.* I am happy to provide more pics if you need them. 

Each item you bundle together **reduces the price by $5** since I don't have to pay for double shipping!

Prices include shipping to CONUS. I'm only shipping to the US at the moment because of our post office situation right now. Sorry about that.

Happy Monday mechmarket, I'm back again trying to sell my Mode Eighty, with some keycap sets also for sale

CONUS buyers only, please

Not looking to trade at the moment, need more liquidity at the moment

Local buyers (Orange County) strongly preferred, especially for the keyboard

**Mode Eighty First Edition - Light**

The First Edition is sold out, but pre-orders are still up and personally I would suggest going that route if you don't need the extra bling of the First Edition and are willing to wait (estimated delivery in January, so not even that long). Plus, the pre-order is much cheaper at $470 and has a lot of really nice colour options. But if you still want the First Edition, I have a brand new Light one that I'm selling for below the $701.51 that I paid in total (CA taxes hit pretty hard). Comes with everything, keyboard still in the paper wrapper.

~~Asking $669.69 + shipping~~ SOLD

&#x200B;

**GMK Camping R2 Base**

~~$275 + shipping~~ SOLD

**GMK Peach Blossom Base**

New, sealed

~~Asking $234.56 + shipping, or $222.22 + shipping, whichever you prefer (just wanted to do fun numbers)~~ SOLD

&#x200B;

$10 discount if you buy both GMK sets.

&#x200B;

**Infinikey Cafe Base**

New, sealed

I must admit the packaging is much nicer than the GMK sets, good job to Infinikey on that

~~Asking $169.420 + $10 shipping (yeah, I know I could've said $179.42 shipped)~~ SOLD

All prices include Shipping. CONUS ONLY.

**KEYBOARDS:**

\- **Think 6.5 Silver**. Probably my favorite board and has seen the most use. It's still in very mint condition. I took great care of this one as my daily driver. PCB works like new with all lights and functions. I also collected most of the badges so there are 11 in total. Comes installed with the acrylic badge. I do not want to split these at this time, therefore, asking $700 for the entire bundle. I can throw in some free white ABS blank top keycaps as well.

\- **TOFU Acrylic 60% w/ MillMax hotswap sockets and brass plate**. Comes with Mauve switches lubed with Krytox 205g0 and tx films. Purchased both keyboard and switches separately from different members. Trying to sell as a bundle but would split if need be. **$215 without switches or $275 bundled.**

**KEYCAPS:**

After testing out a few different profiles I realize I'm a GMK slut. Can't seem to enjoy any other profile type. Passing on these sets that are essentially brand new.

\- **Domikey BoB All in one set**. Literally mounted alphas and said no thanks. Back in the box. Purchased these new off another member. **$80** SOLD

\- **OSA Sleeves set**. Same story, tested alphas for a few minutes then back in the box. Asking **$80**. SOLD

~~**Gothic70:** This is the full frosted acrylic version. Built with lil'Tykes switches, being lubed with krytox 205g0 on the slider, sides of the top housing, and the spring bottoms, and filmed with TX blue films.; Also built with purple durock V1 stabs. This was my first soldering job, so there's some solder on the PCB (one spot I unsuccessfully tried to clean off) that's shown off in the additional images, but I've had no problems after using it for a few days. Can also mess around with the layout for free if you'd like. (Stepped caps lock, split backspace, etc.) **Looking for $240 shipped**~~ **SOLD**

**Hasu USB:** Used for a few months, mostly to just switch caps lock and control. **Looking for $55 shipped**

~~**Hagoromo Alphas:** Bought these back in February and used them for a couple months but I couldn't find much shine, so I'll call these having very light shine. 7u spacebar has a small amount of warp, and the 6.25u has little to no warp, but has a mark which I couldn't clean off.

Hi everyone. I'm looking to sell my custom DZ60 Laser board and GMK Laser sets. The keyboard was custom made for the GMK Laser set, it has pink LEDs to match the Laser color. I have prices listed for individual items but I would really like to to sell the Laser board and the GMK Laser sets bundled. I am more willing to negotiate on the price if bought together rather than the individually. So if you are messaging me about buying an individual set, please know that those who are interested in buying bundled will take priority. Only looking for cash, not accepting trades.

**I'm doing a deal for the DZ60 Laser Board + GMK Laser Gaijin, Blocknet, Kobe, and Novelties for $320 ($140 less than individual) IF BOUGHT AS A BUNDLE.**

###FAQ
1. Which parts of the switch do I lube?  
> Bottom housing (rails, center post, bottom)  
> Stem (all sides and legs) - tactile legs NOT lubed  
>
> [Work Station & Example of Lubing](https://imgur.com/a/HreuCIa)  
> **20,000+ switches lubed**
> 
> ***Disclaimer: Unless otherwise stated, factory lube is not removed prior to modifications. YMMV.***

2. What is 205g2+105 and how does it compare to 205g0?    
>  205g2+105 is a 1:1 mixture of 205g2 and 105 commonly used among Korean keyboard enthusiasts, popular Youtuber [:3ildcat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeHOkFGW-7uAZFvq3BXb8YA), and sold by [TX Keyboards](https://www.us.txkeyboards.com/products/krytox-lube?variant=31403083825212). The result is a mixture with a consistency very similar to 205g0, which is a mixture of 105 and PTFE powder.

3. Switch sales cannot be confirmed as per r/mechmarket rules

Hello, I have these items for sale.

| Item | Notes | Product Info | Asking Price (USD) |
|:----:|:-----:|:------------:|:------------:|
|GMK Shoko R1|Like-new condition. Base Kit only **but** I would like to keep the lighter-colored F5-F8, Print Screen, Scroll Lock, Pause caps because the R2 doesn't have them. These will ship in a bag.|[here](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=98202.0)|~~$250~~ sold|
|GalaxKey Silicap V5| Looks like it's OEM Profile, 2.25u, Row 4 (zxcvbnm,./ row)|[bought from mechmarket](https://old.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/d7u1uq/cabc_h_gmk_cyan_dsa_hc_granite_galaxkey_silicap/)|$50|
|Ducky One 2 Mini v2 RGB LED|I got this in a local trade. No idea what the keycaps are (original keycaps are missing CapsLock and H), 67g Zealios V2 lubed with 3204 and filmed with KeBo films, lubed plate mount stabs (I did my best), case filled with shelf liner|[here](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=4322)|$150|
|Niu40| Flashed with VIA, details below | [here](https://kbdfans.com/collections/diy-kit/products/niu-mini-40-diy-kit)|~~$100~~ sold|

The Niu40 is black anodized aluminium top and acrylic bottom. It'll also have the [OLKB Acute Keycaps](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-x-olkb-acute-ortholinear-keycap-set).4 I filled the Niu40 with switches I bought to sample. I'm 90% sure I lubed these switches (there's no spring ping, and I always lube springs when lubing switches), but I forgot lube what I used. These switches are not filmed:

- the 8 switches in the leftmost/rightmost columns of the board are Aliaz 70g
- R1 alphas are Gateron Ink Silent
- R2 alphas are NK_ Cream
- R3 alphas are FEI Matcha
- R4 are Originative MOD-M

Additionally, I think I lifted half of a pad or 2 on the PCB in the past, but it is working 100% according to the key tester in VIA configurator. ~~You can still buy a Niu40 PCB from [kbdfans](https://kbdfans.com/collections/40/products/niu-mini-40-pcb-full-program) if you just want the case from me.~~ They're not selling them anymore, but fingers crossed for continued future support?

|**Sold ~~Space65 Cybervoyager White Gold + Extra PCB + White, Black, Gold Badges + Case Foam~~**|~~This is from the R2 GB, used for about a week. It is currently built with Holy Panda's (YOK Housing + Halo Stem) lubed with tribosys 3203 and clear Durock stabs lubed with 205g0 on the housing / stem and dielectric grease on the wire. I was hyped for this originally, but have grown out of the 65% format. There is also a little mark on the Space65 that I have featured in the timestamp pictures linked above. It came like this and I have not really tried any sort of way to clean / remove it. I am willing to desolder it if requested. Not looking to sell the extras separately. Will be shipped in original packaging.~~|**Sold ~~$800 OBO~~**|
|**Singa V3 PC (Brass Plate)**|From the last Singa V3 PC release, I used this keyboard for quite a bit. I have pictures of the few scratches it has accumulated from use (2 minimal ones) linked in the timestamp above. The PCB does have 3 keys that require to be jumped. It currently is not built, but it has the jumper cable and switches in the spots that need to be jumped. Will be shipped in original packaging.|**$600 OBO**|

All prices in USD. PM to find out shipping cost (usually it will be under $10 for UPS ground if not too heavy, keyboards will be more). If buy in a bundle can save on shipping. No refund or exchange P.S. I have recently met a very non-sense and demanding buyer making trouble, so I have to put this here to protect myself. Normally this never is an issue.

Hey /r/mechmarket, I've been making commisioned cables for a few months now with 25+ satisfied customers and so I've decided to brand myself as **Curlicue Cables**! This is Batch One of my **ready-to-ship cables.**

&nbsp;

So many people are making cables these days, and I've noticed prices for keycap-inspired cables that are just *too damn high*, anywhere from $70-$100, with a lead time of several months, GB-style! Nobody likes to wait, which is why I'm making themed cables at affordable prices in large batches, **ready-to-ship.**

&nbsp;

**My cable process:** USB2.0-spec shielded cable is sleeved with high-quality paracord and double-sleeved with genuine Flexo-PET Techflex for quality and durability. Once sleeved, Cables are coiled at 3/8"" using Zap Coil Collars (no tape!) and oven baked at 210F, freezed to cool, baked and cooled once more, and reverse-coiled for a [springy, quality coil](https://imgur.com/ojWIwWZ). That's a total of **three heat/cool cycles**, one more than most vendors! [Connections are soldered](https://imgur.com/fyEYGJA) at 300 degrees using Kester 63/37 leaded solder, and heatshrink applied carefully with a heat-gun.

~~[Lunar Rover **B-Stock**](https://imgur.com/93Y7TmW)~~ | ~~This cable is built from [Zap's Old-School cable](https://zapcables.com/custom-old-school-retractable-cable/), which is a rubber, non-sleeved material. This type of cable can be [stretched and is much more durable than normal coils](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFfo8-XHk_O/). [GMK Lunar-themed](https://thekey.company/products/gmk-lunar), cable has some visible [tooling](https://imgur.com/D5dNG9r) [marks](https://imgur.com/jKImltt) but functions normally. 8-inch coil.~~ | ~~1~~ 0 | ~~$20~~
*Shipping $6 CONUS* in a [8""x8"" box, shipped securely in a bubble-wrapped sleeve](https://imgur.com/LFwpoe5).

&nbsp;

*If you are planning to use one of these cables with a high-demand board like an HHKB, CTRL, or ALT, it may not power the board properly. I unfortunately do not have any of these boards on hand for testing.*

&nbsp;

There will be one more batch of these cables in these colorways.","[US-IN][H] Curlicue Cables Batch One | White/Black & Mizu Coiled + Detachable Cables, Ready to Ship [W] PayPal"

Graystudio Think 6.5 (black polycarb, badgeless, hotswap, NK Blueberries)

As the title says, I have a badgeless, black polycarb, hotswap, Think 6.5 that I need to let go. I just don’t use it anymore. Includes stock, unlubed NK Blueberries and one Tealio for the Esc key rgb. Built with durock stabs lubed with Krytox. I will point out that one of the interior screws is slightly stripped that hold the pcb to the top case. No issues with functionality at all.

This is a badgeless version too, which is extremely rare in the black polycarb. It is in great condition and sounds phenomenal. I'm hoping someone else can get some good use out of it. I would say it’s been typed on for maybe a couple weeks. Any questions please ask.

Switches are just lying around. I'm not building any more MX boards so I don't need them.

GMK caps were bought for a potential board but I never got another MX board. Pricing will be cheaper if ***shipped without a tray*** but the buyer takes responsibility. This is cheaper than the other ones I see listed but feel free to offer whatever you think is fair.

Happy Holidays to my reddit peeps!

~~GMK DMG R2 w/ Spacebars~~ ($240), ~~GMK WOB Drop~~ ($120), ~~ePBT Retro Cyrillic~~ ($130)

Looking to sell a few of items today to help me finance a future Toyota 4runner SUV so I can do some road tripping. Also helping those out who have been unable to find XMAS presents in these troubling times.

The DMG R2 was received in a trade. Condition is still mint condition perfect. Did not like the look on my keeb so deciding to sell. Did mount some keys to Cherry Blue switches. Spacebars is still sealed. Did not notice any major warping in the Spacebars. WOB set was recently purchased from Drop. Only opened for inspection so never mounted. No signs of warping in the Spacebars and did not see any defects or discolourization in the keycaps. Includes white accent keys. ePBT Retro Cyrillic was purchased from the Originative GB earlier this year. Just not a fan of PBT keycaps. Please note that ePBT PBT sets aren't perfect so there will be warping in the Spacebars and some mods do not have perfect rectangle side edges. Does not cause any issues when in use.

This is NOT FCFS since I'll be looking for buyers with a rep or peeps I've dealt with in the past. Local is the Twin Cities/Suburbs and will discount accordingly. Not afraid to sell to new peeps either if ur pretty convincing. All prices are firm and will include USPS shipping. Discounts if you don't need the retail packaging and okay with shipping in ziplock baggies. Keeping transactions to CONUS for now. Please send PM and reply to post. NO CHATS....NO TRADES....AND PLEASE NO LOW BALL OFFERS

I can take more pictures if needed and can answer any questions. I will try to answer all PMs but my dearest apologies if you don't get a response. Will update post when items are sold. Thank you everyone and be safe out there.","[US-MN] [H] GMK DMG R2, GMK WOB, ePBT Retro Cyrillic [W] Paypal, Local"

Ignore H1 timestamp, they have been sold

Prices are all OBO and include shipping to CAN and USA. Not looking to ship overseas at this moment in time.

Item | Description |Price
---|---|---
Keycult 1/65 Rev1  | White/Brass. Originally an A-stock but there's a hairline scratch on the left side near the top and the brass started tarnishing which I think its closer to a B-stock now. The white on the top and bottom case are somewhat mismatched. Internal scuffs that don't affect the board when built are shown. Screw holes have lost some of the coating due to overtightening. Only 1 is shown but all holes are in similar condition. Some bumps on the top piece which seems like the top piece was not cleaned properly before coating. Good board for custom refinishes. Includes a brass and pc plate with 1 pcb that has been desoldered twice and flux mostly removed. Pcb has been tested and works. I will fully declare for customs so you should expect duties as this is an expensive item. | 2000 USD
TX EO-87 | Grey, Crystal, WKL, FR4 plate, acrylic weight. The pad for the \ key has been ripped off and had to be bridged to another key. Flux has been mostly cleaned. See timestamps for details. Built with milky gateron yellows, springs lubed with gpl105 and switches lubed with 205g0. Durock stabs lubed with 205g0 on housing and dielectric grease on wire. Spacebar stab does not play well with warped spacebars, I suggest GMK otherwise it will be sluggish. Other than the PCB issue, the case is flawless. The case is compatible with the h87a from hineybush if you want to replace the pcb. All original accessories will be included (TX bag, screws, cable, sticker) | 350 USD
~~GMK Olivia++ Light and spacebars~~ | ~~Sealed. Not splitting kits.~~ | ~~375 USD~~ Sold 460 Cad Local
~~S-Craft Artisans ~~| ~~These are from R2. Jigglypuff, Gengar, Pikachu, Snorlax and Magikarp. Never mounted. Not splitting. ~~| ~~375 USD~~ Sold for 360USD + Express shipping

Hope everyone's December is off to a good start! I've got some extra FR4 plates from a recent batch I had made that I am looking to sell now.

They are from JLCPCB with a custom silkscreen that says HEX.3C to match the board...had help from a friend to design in, his logo is the vanilla cone there under the spacebar.

***DISCLOSURE***

These plates have been modified slightly. They were cut with the incorrect height dimensions for the stabilizer holes and thus did not allow the spacebar and enter keys to return to full height. I took a Dremel to the holes today to expand them and tested each to make sure they work. Just know that the stab holes are not the prettiest thing to look at...(you can see what I'm talking about in the timestamp)

they are all fixed tsangan layout, which you can see in the timestamp. There is also a typing test with GMK keycaps and JWK stems in Milky Gateron housings.

Asking $15 shipped per plate to the US and I have 2 left. Thanks!",[US-OH][H]Hex.3c FR4 Plates [W] Paypal

Looking to sell a planned build to pay for a new laptop and drawing tablet for my sister. I want to sell as a bundle because the Mizu base kit is sealed, and the OG GMK tray size is terrible for shipping. Luckily I still have the box the Space65 was sent to me in, which fits the kit perfectly. **As a result, I'll only be offering the Mizu as a bundle with the Space65.**

**~~Space65~~** **SOLD!**

Still sealed brand new Black/Gold kit with a carbon fiber plate. All parts should still be in the box, including the vibration and noise reduction pads, screwdriver, tweezers, weight, etc. Looking for $630 shipped by itself, and $610 as part of a bundle.

**~~GMK Mizu~~** **SOLD!**

Still sealed brand new GMK Mizu base kit from way back when. The base kit should cover most standard things such as 60%, MX HHKB, WKL, 75%, TKL, 1800, and full size. Looking for $380 shipped as part of a bundle.

Depending on the circumstances, I might decide to sell GMK Mizu separately or change the bundle options. However, my first priority is to sell the Space65 so I won't really open up that option until the board has been sold.

Looking to sell the following:

**SA Laser (Gaijin, Obnet, Numpad, Mitowaves, Turbo, Arrows)** \- Lightly used, barely any shine. **$320 + shipping**

**GMK Pulse Mitolet** \- One month old. Zero shine and in perfect condition. The violet is intoxicating.  **$180 + shipping** 

**YMDK84** \- Less than a month old with hotswap YMD75v3 PCB. Low profile acrylic case. Will throw in sip sockets + LED of choice (18mm, Amber, Purple, Blue). Lubed with Krytox 2050, Deskeys filmed, on Kailh speed silvers. Sounds smooth as a butter and in perfect condition. **$350 + shipping (+$20 for sip sockets & LEDs)**

**KBD75v2** \- One month old. Comes with Brass plate, full aluminum, Cherry MX silent reds. In perfect condition. **$220 + shipping**

**Razer Huntsman TKL** \- Bought two months ago but barely used. Most sensitive keyboard I've ever owned. Perfect for gaming but actuation is too light for my taste. Nice RGB with HyperX pudding keycaps. **$120 + shipping**

Will throw in the KBD75v2 brand new case for extra **+$30** or the dust cover protector (**only covers standard 75% and compatible with KBD75 or the YMDK84**) for **+$35**. Not looking to part with the keyboard case and the dust cover protector separately.

**All shipping are to CONUS only**. A little back story to the YMDK84: I wanted a compact 75% that's perfect for gaming (dota 2 since I use the function keys) and I noticed that there weren't a lot of acrylic cases AND hotswappable 75% available in the market. I wanted full customizability and even bought sip sockets and LEDs to match different keycaps down the road. However, I bought a Sat75 recently and decided to part ways with this as well as my other boards. The YMDK84 is probably the keyboard closest to heart and most pragmatic for gaming, hence the pricier costs.

Please don't use chat. Comment and send me a message.

~~Hi,~~

~~I'm looking to sell a board I've built recently.~~

~~I put in tactile switches for the first time and found out that I'm more of a linear person.~~

&#x200B;

~~The configurations are as follows.~~

~~- Key 65 PC WK, No logo~~

~~- Brass E-Yellow Plate, Brass E-Yellow Weight(w/ white key logo)~~

~~- Built with Cherry Ergo Clears(MX Tactile Clears with custom swapped springs), filed with TX films~~

~~- Used high-end custom springs manufacturing company SPRiT's slow curve to enhance tactility(60.5g, 63.5g for spacebar)~~

~~- Cherry authentic stabilizers(GON stabs), mounts lubed with 205g0, wires lubed with 205g2, I'm pretty sure you would be satisfied with the stabs if you use GMK keycaps~~

~~- Physical reset button on the PCB removed due to interference with the bottom housing(separately sealed, will be included in the package)~~

~~- Original box and whatever that's left is included~~

~~- No cracks, but there could be light scratches due to the characteristic of the housing material~~

~~- Keycaps not included!~~

&#x200B;

* ~~$629 shipped (CONUS), $576 + shipping (Elsewhere) - paypal transaction fees included!~~
* ~~The prices are subject to an additional 4.5% paypal transaction fee.~~

# Discounts and priorities will be given to bundles. All prices include PayPal fee and shipping* to most parts of EU and NA via DHL or UPS.

\*Remote charge might occur depending on your address so please pm it to me to check. Feel free to msg me about shipping in Asia because there might be a $5 discount from the courier. Pm if you are in Toronto, Canada for other cheaper arrangements.

The typical timeframe is 1-2 weeks, including domestic shipping to the proxy, their processing time in HK (3 days usually), time that cargos waiting for pick-up at bay and the time on flight to the destinations. It is pretty reliable since COVID-19 albeit possible delays during the holiday season. [Here's some DHL tracking after they pick up the package.](https://imgur.com/a/czxgagT)

Sold sets will be striked-thru. If you insist on splitting the kits from the bundle, extra shipping cost will be added.

Hey guys, I have some items to sell

All prices include PayPal fees, invoice only. As usual please comment before DM, no chat.

Please note that mail services are still somewhat unpredictable, so shipping might take a long time.

&#x200B;

**1.** **GMK Ursa base sealed**

**Note**: trays were squished and cracked during shipping (yay new GMK).

In this situation I can: 1. Ship as is 2. Unseal and transfer in another good tray 3. Unseal and ship in bags

**$265** \+ shipping

**2. Dwarf Factory Kraken artisan** in color **Octopods**

* Profile: SA

Selling my little monster project which has the following:

* Discipline V2 black pcb / white plate / white backplate
* Gateron Yellow lubed with Krytox 205g0
* GMK stabilizers lubed with Krytox 205g0
* Felt dampener (stacked felt between plate and backplate; had no foam alternative at the time, can be replaced easily if needed)

Price w/o shipping - USD $100

Looking to sell a planned build to pay for a new laptop and drawing tablet for my sister. I want to sell as a bundle because the Mizu base kit is sealed, and the OG GMK tray size is terrible for shipping. Luckily I still have the box the Space65 was sent to me in, which fits the kit perfectly. **As a result, I'll only be offering the Mizu as a bundle with the Space65.**

**~~Space65~~** **SOLD!**

Still sealed brand new Black/Gold kit with a carbon fiber plate. All parts should still be in the box, including the vibration and noise reduction pads, screwdriver, tweezers, weight, etc. Looking for $630 shipped by itself, and $610 as part of a bundle.

**~~GMK Mizu~~** **SOLD!**

Still sealed brand new GMK Mizu base kit from way back when. The base kit should cover most standard things such as 60%, MX HHKB, WKL, 75%, TKL, 1800, and full size. Looking for $380 shipped as part of a bundle.

Depending on the circumstances, I might decide to sell GMK Mizu separately or change the bundle options. However, my first priority is to sell the Space65 so I won't really open up that option until the board has been sold.

Hello. I have a couple offerings today:

&#x200B;

|~~GMK WoB Hiragana~~|~~Just starting to shine a little bit on the alphas and spacebar. NOTE: there was damage to a couple of keys and it is clearly depicted in the timestamp. I will not sell to anyone unless they can tell me they understand what is damaged. The most damaged key is the standard layout right shift (the big one). The 6.25u spacebar has some wear on the left as well as one of the 6u space bars. Very disappointed about this myself but don't want anyone to be unaware of this. Also important to note is that it appears there are 2x 6u spacebars. One has damage and one is in great condition. The 7u spacebar is on the board and its in good condition.~~|~~$250 shipped OBO~~ SOLD|
|:-|:-|:-|
|~~67x H1 switches~~|~~Lubed 205g0 + 105 oil 1:1 mix on stem and bottom housing / 105 oil on springs / 0.125 mm TX films NOTE: They have been desoldered once. Most are clean but I can go through them and clean up the ""dirty"" ones for an additional $10~~|~~$55 shipped as-is, $65 shipped cleanly-desoldered~~ **~~PENDING~~** **SOLD**|

I was planning on using the Space65 but I realized that I didn't really like it as much. So the build is still wrapped in the plastic. I did take the liberty of installing 7305s as I was going to use it. I installed 7305s everywhere except for the 1x on the backspace since it sits on the same level as the stabilizers and doesn't work. If you want, I can install them for you. I'm negotiable on price, so feel free to offer, but feel like this is in line with what I saw.

No shine used once. Spacebar from the base set and accent will be put in bags since the modern kit and accent kit are in the base box instead of the spacebars. no splitting. 225 Euro seems like a good deal since people actually sell the base alone for 300 dollars.

Hello mechmarket! I have a KBD8X Mkii for sale. I tried selling it last time but it did not work so I'll be selling it for much less this time in hopes that someone will buy it for its worth. Please comment first before sending a pm, and I will only be taking CONUS buyers, not international.

[Sound Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RrMMdXxuLQ)

**Specs:**

\- Brass Plate

\- **Nolive Switches** (Recolored Creams w/ a 63.5g weight): lubed with 205g0

\- Grey C3 Stabs w/ Black PVD wires: lubed with 205g0

\- KBD8X Dampener from KBDFans

**Imperfections:**

\- There are a few scratches on the brass weight, which is shown in a picture. However, the rest of the anodization on the aluminum parts are flawless as far as I can tell. Nothing here will affect the sound.

**Asking Price:** $450 shipped

\- Last time I priced the keyboard at $550. I bought the board unbuilt for $400 from another user on mechmarket and unfortunately I do not use it anymore, so I thought someone else would like to have it. I am selling the board at a net loss if anyone would like to know.

Hope everyone's December is off to a good start! I've got some extra FR4 plates from a recent batch I had made that I am looking to sell now.

They are from JLCPCB with a custom silkscreen that says HEX.3C to match the board...had help from a friend to design in, his logo is the vanilla cone there under the spacebar.

***DISCLOSURE***

These plates have been modified slightly. They were cut with the incorrect height dimensions for the stabilizer holes and thus did not allow the spacebar and enter keys to return to full height. I took a dremmel to the holes today to expand them and tested each to make sure they work. Just know that the stab holes are not the prettiest thing to look at...(you can see what i'm talking about in the timestamp)

they are all fixed tsangan layout, which you can see in the timestamp. There is also a typing test with GMK keycaps and JWK stems in Milky Gateron housings.

[**The WhiteFox Keyboard from Drop**](https://drop.com/buy/the-whitefox-keyboard) **- $150 USD Shipped CONUS**

I bought this keyboard pre-built from MassDrop in August 2016. It has Gateron Blue switches and is in the True Fox layout which is basically just split backspace with a 1.25 1.25 1.25 6.25 1.25 1.25 bottom row layout. I never really used it much at all as I realized I didn't like blue switches. It does have a small scuff near the top right corner and another one along the front. Both of these should be visible in the timestamp photos. I've just been holding onto this for a long time and would like to get rid of it. It comes with the original box, cable, and a few extra keys that came with it. The feet on the bottom can be removed and will be removed before shipping.

I bought this keyboard on Amazon in January 2019. It also has Cherry MX Blue switches. I tried to order it twice with MX Clears, but got blues instead both times so I kind of just gave up. I tried to use it for a few hours but still didn't like it. It's basically brand new and comes with the original box, cable, and a few extra grey keys as I had put the RGBY mod keys on after getting it. The feet on the bottom are removable as well if that matters and will be removed before shipping.

Second, I have a one-off Green Southpaw Fullsized. This board was made as a prototype and wasn't actually offered during the groupbuy.

The board is build with lubed NK Creams and clipped/lubed/band-aid moded genuine GMK stabs.

There are some ano issues (streaking, slight discoloration) but in my opinion, the flaws are very hard to see in normal use. There are also some very light scratches on the inside of the case.

It doesn't come with keycaps or artisans.

Hey guys, I have some items to sell

All prices include PayPal fees, invoice only. As usual please comment before DM, no chat.

**Worldwide shipping,** will be calculated on request, please DM for that. For artisans should be about $10, for Ursa around $20. There is also an express shipping available, should be about $30-40.

Please note that mail services are still somewhat unpredictable, so shipping might take a long time.

&#x200B;

**1.** **GMK Ursa base sealed**

**Note**: trays were squished and cracked during shipping (yay new GMK).

In this situation I can: 1. Ship as is 2. Unseal and transfer in another good tray 3. Unseal and ship in bags

**$265** \+ shipping

&#x200B;

**2. Dwarf Factory Kraken artisans** in colors **Octopods** and **Emerald**

* Profile: SA
* Profile Row: Row 1
* Switch Type: MX (Cherry MX & Its clones)

Never used as a key, only put on for photos. Note that they both came in one box, so the first buyer gets the box, the second keycap will be shipped in some other form of secure package.

**$75 each or $135 for both** \+ shipping

&#x200B;

**3. Canoe gen.1 carbon fiber plate**

I had a carbon fiber plate made for my Canoe gen. 1 polycarbonate Bluetooth. Did the CAD myself based on the layout file from ai03 plate generator. I had 2 made, used one of them myself — assembled perfectly with Tangies, see the album or I can send you the stream VOD with assembly.

**Japanese Keycaps**: Similar (probably too similar) to GMK Bentos. Barely used one week, perfect conditions. **50€**

Hi all,

PRICES INCLUDE SHIPPING :)

~~KBD8x Mkii (400$). The case is in great condition and the pcb is fully functioning and programmable with VIA. Though there is one [mark](https://imgur.com/gallery/jDg2rFG) on the front right of the case. It is built with alpacas, lightly lubed with krytox 205g0 and filmed with Deskeys gasket films on a brass plate with case foam. Durock stabilizers are lubed with krytox 205g0. The top is PC and the bottom is Grey aluminum which gives the case some real heft compared to a standard PC case. 
I bought this as an A stock unit from another user on here.Will be shipped in original package from kbdfans.~~ SOLD 375$


70x Gateron Ink v2 (70$) - lubed with krytox 205g0, filmed with deskeys gasket films, and spring swapped with tx springs lubed with tax oil. Used in hot swap board briefly. Will come with OG springs, lube deck and extra spring lube.

Prices are all OBO and include shipping to CAN and USA. Not looking to ship overseas at this moment in time.

Item | Description |Price
---|---|---
Keycult 1/65  | White/Brass. Originally an A-stock but there's a hairline scratch on the left side near the top and the brass started tarnishing which I think its closer to a B-stock now. The white on the top and bottom case are somewhat mismatched. Internal scuffs that don't affect the board are shown. Screw holes have lost some of the coating due to overtightening. Only 1 is shown but all holes are in similar condition.  Seems like the top piece was not cleaned properly before coating. Good board for custom refinishes. Includes a brass and pc plate with 1 pcb that has been desoldered twice and flux mostly removed. Pcb has been tested and works. I will fully declare for customs so you should expect duties as this is an expensive item. | 2000 USD
TX EO-87 | Grey Crystal WKL. FR4 plate. The pad for the \ key has been ripped off and had to be bridged to another key. Flux has  been mostly cleaned. See timestamps for details. Built with milky gateron yellows, springs lubed with pl105 and switches lubed with 205g0. Durock stabs lubed with 205g0 on housing and dielectric grease on wire. Spacebar stab does not play well with warped spacebars, I suggest GMK otherwise it will be sluggish. Other than the PCB issue, flawless. The case is compatible with the h87a from hineybush if you want to replace the pcb. All original accessories will be included (TX bag, screws, cable, sticker) | 350 USD
GMK Olivia++ and spacebars | Sealed. Not splitting kits. | 400 USD
S-Craft Artisans | These are from R2. Jigglypuff, Gengar, Pikachu, Snorlax and Magikarp. Never mounted. Not splitting. | 400 USD
Jellykey Koi | Katsutoshi colorway 1u and 6.25u. Never mounted. Not splitting. | 150 USD
