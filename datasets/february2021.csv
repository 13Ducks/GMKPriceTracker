Hi everyone. I'm looking to sell my KBD75 build and some other things. The KBD75 was my first build, I've had it since 2018 and I've hardly used it. It is in amazing condition and has no flaws at all.

I have prices listed for individual items but I would really like to to sell everything bundled to save on shipping. I am open to reasonable offers but I am more willing to negotiate on the price if bought together rather than the individually. So if you are messaging me about buying an individual item, please know that those who are interested in buying bundled will take priority. Only looking for cash, not accepting trades.

**I'm doing a deal for the KBD75 + DZ60 + 5 Degree case for $200 ($40 less than individual) IF BOUGHT AS A BUNDLE.**

Hi everyone, I have a keeb I have been using for a few months and was modded quite heavily. I have switched the switches to spray-lubed Gateron Yellows (originally Gateron Browns), added foam into the case, and spray painted it blue. Includes all original keycaps in great shape as well as the USB cable. The keyboard supports both Mac and PC layouts and can be paired with 3 devices via BT, the battery lasts for a long time. Shipping only to EU. Great board for a start in the MK hobby, or someone who wants to mod it even more. Easy and approachable tray mount design. 

I would like to get \~80e OBO just to cover some of my investment, also willing to cover part of the shipping depending on how much it will be.

Mostly I would like to find a new home for the keeb since I haven't been using it very much.

More pics in the timestamp link :)

I also have Krytox 205 grade 0 and 105 in 5 or 10g packages (larger orders are possible).

RAMA M65-B is brand new and was only taken out to do some inspections and make sure it was the right color and what not. The board is in the Moon colorway, has a solder PCB, and comes with an internal dampener. The top right corner has a slight anode discoloration mark and the bottom edges have some issues (timestamps document these problems).

Black Duck TC- V3 built with Zealios V2s and GMK screw in stabilizers in a silver alu plate. There are two marks with one being on the back side and the other being on the right corner.

Cleaning up my collection a bit, and found these two boards from 2016/2017, both of which have interesting histories.

**Exclusive's first board:** [the E8-V1](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=87572.0).  I am selling an **unbuilt WKL Founders Edition, #33** (of 33), **MAO white**, with raw brass weight, two plates (red alu, steel), one PCB, a bunch of badges in different colors.   

*Like the other E8-V1s, I have observed alignment issues where the WKL blockers touch the keycaps above them (only tested the steel plate). This can be remedied for the most part by pushing the plate up up up when screwing it into the top case. Otherwise this is a really nice, chunky, and limited board.  I went through a lot to get this board with all parts working, and it has left me with somewhat of a bitter taste that I can't get rid off (The GB for this was a real mess, to say the least, check the GH thread above for full history). Hence me selling it.*  

Looking for **~~$400 OBO~~ SOLD for asking**.

**Feng's** [**Smart 68 V1**](https://web.archive.org/web/20180703134842/https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=83442.0) (not to be confused with the Magicforce 68 Smart). One of the first custom keyboards that came with hotswap sockets. I am selling a Silver V1 (low profile) with a red plate. Layout B (which is rather unconventional).  

*Similarly to the E8-V1, the GB was pretty awful. Feng/Geekkeys were super unresponsive and some people never got their board after all. I was lucky and got all the ones I ordered (I am keeping a black one for myself). It's actually quite a nice low-profile board. Almost not bezel to it. Here a* [*few photos with SA keycaps*](https://imgur.com/a/p3Nmm) *but it also looks quite good with GMK. Stabs need to be relubed.*

For sale is my personal NK65 Aluminum Silver. I've used this keyboard for about a month now, and since decided to move on to a TKL keyboard as I've struggled with adopting the 65% layout.

Minor marks / scratches on plate from swapping out switches. Otherwise in excellent condition. Comes with lubed + filmed gateron yellows (Krytox 205g0, Deskeys switch films), lubed Cherry GMK plate-mount stabilizers (yes, the genuine thing from Germany, I swapped out the stock ones), Stupidfish case foam, and all accessories from Novelkeys, including cable, carrying case, and original packaging.

Asking ~~$250 shipped~~ **(SOLD for $225)** and insured anywhere in the USA. Just trying to make back my original investment (NK65 was $185 + $20 shipping, gat yellows + films for $20, GMK stabs $15, case foam $10) - not profiting at all.

Happy Friday everyone,

Got some stuff up for grabs that I no longer use/ never used. All prices are OBO. Please comment before PM. PM and chat are both ok but I respond to PMs faster. Thanks!

**Key65 PC - $600 + shipping OBO**  
First up is a polycarb Key65 with a silver badge and a white back weight with a dark green/teal weight. Barely used and no scuffs/scratches or anything. Comes with a solder PCB, aluminum plate, and FR4 Plate. Comes with the original box and packaging.

**Key65 Hotswap PCB - $55 + shipping OBO**  
Perfect condition. Mounted once so everything works. Supports more than just a standard ANSI layout. If you buy it with the keyboard we can work out a bundle deal

\***EDIT**: I have several folks interested in both the hotswap and solder PCB alone. The priority goes to the keyboard first. If you are interested in the keyboard you can have it with either the hotswap or solder PCB or both (at extra cost)  
\***EDIT 2**: I am also open to trading the Key65 for an aluminum version if you have one. Please PM with details. Thanks!

**Kono Kira Black Aluminum Top - $325 + shipping ($400 with lubed Zeal Sakurios) OBO**  
I barely used this thing, maybe for a week or two. It did come with a few minor scuffs on the corners of the black aluminum top from the factory. If it bothers you, you can buy a replacement top for around $10 from Kono. The plate has some minor scratches from switch removal otherwise in great condition. The lighting and everything work perfectly. Comes with the original case, no original accessories though.

**Built Percent Studios Canoe Gen 1 (non-BT) - $400 + shipping OBO**  
Flawless condition Canoe Gen 1 built with lubed Zeal Tealios V2s and lubed everglide stabs. Everything works perfectly. It also comes with a specially designed acrylic cover to protect the board from dust

**Built Savage65 Navy - $380 + shipping OBO**  
Flawless A-stock Savage65 in navy. Built with lubed OA switches and c3 stabs and fr4 plate. Comes in the original shipping box but not with the carrying case.

**~~New Skyline 78 Fog PC - $485 + shipping OBO~~**  
~~Brand new, unbuilt Skyline 78 in the Fog polycarb finish. Only 30 units made of this small group buy. It's got a numpad layout with a full gasket mount. The layout wasn't for me so never built it.~~  SOLD for asking

Rev4 Zeal60 RGB LED PCB, Zeal Transparent Gold Plated PCB Mount Screw-in Stabilizers V2, and Holy Pandas. This is a high quality board and it sure feels like it. It sounds incredible (best I've ever heard honestly), and is a thiccc boy, super heavy. I purchased the components and had a pro do the build. This was my first 60 board, and after doing a few test runs I knew the 60 layout wasn't for me. I'm a gamer and need the extra keys. In hindsight I should have seen this coming.

Hello MechMarket.

I hope everyone is well.  I am offloading some of my collection below.  I have tried to price my items as competitively as possible.  I am sure that some are in stock items right now and I've tried to reflect that in the price as well.  It is highly possible that I have failed horribly in my pricing, hence the OBO.  More pics available upon request.

Thanks for looking

~~Lubrigante Case – Acrylic Case in matte clear acrylic.  Ordered from Ponoko in January 2021 and quickly moved onto designing my own custom stacked case so I no longer need this one.  You can pick up a pcb from switch couture, sneakbox, or project keyboard who have theirs on preorder.   I ordered an extra acrylic spacers to accommodate top and bottom mount usb C.  One of the additional spacers has a crack in it but has been repaired.  (If you have a pcb topside usbc you wont need this piece). The rest of the acrylic is in excellent shape as it was used as a model.  Hardware included is brass stand off and m2 hex sockets.  Skip the wait time and trying to find hardware.  With all pieces the case is 18mm.  Stack height is 7.5mm part a (hi profile no gap), 3mm part B plate, part c and d 8mm, and 2mm part E.

&nbsp;

So many people are making cables these days, and I've noticed prices for keycap-inspired cables that are just *too damn high*, anywhere from $70-$100, with a lead time of several months, GB-style! Nobody likes to wait, which is why I'm making themed cables at affordable prices in large batches, **ready-to-ship.**

&nbsp;

**My cable process:** USB2.0-spec shielded cable is sleeved with high-quality paracord and double-sleeved with genuine Flexo-PET Techflex for quality and durability. Once sleeved, Cables are coiled at 3/8"" using Zap Coil Collars (no tape!) and oven baked at 210F, freezed to cool, baked and cooled once more, and reverse-coiled for a [springy, quality coil](https://imgur.com/ojWIwWZ). That's a total of **three heat/cool cycles**, one more than most vendors! [Connections are soldered](https://imgur.com/fyEYGJA) at 300 degrees using Kester 63/37 leaded solder, and heatshrink applied carefully with a heat-gun.

Cable Colorway |  Qty. Remaining | Price | Description
------------------|--------------|------------------|-------
~~[Clean White](https://imgur.com/VJidmUU)~~ | 0 | ~~$50~~ | ~~For those who want a clean, simple cable that matches with anything~~
[Clean White straight cable](https://imgur.com/et19nLC) |  1 | $32 | I have a Clean White without the coil, 7-inch device-end.
[Water](https://imgur.com/lwW2rUC) | 3 | $50 | Color-matched with a certain popular set, Mizu
~~[Stormtrooper](https://imgur.com/0fyVi1a)~~ | 0 | ~~$60~~ | ~~LAST ONE! Miss all your blaster shots with this cable, also known as BoW~~
[Lunar Rover](https://imgur.com/hRGPCts) | 1 | $30 | This cable is built from [Zap's Old-School cable](https://zapcables.com/custom-old-school-retractable-cable/), which is a rubber, non-sleeved material. [GMK Lunar-themed](https://thekey.company/products/gmk-lunar), 8-inch coil.
*Shipping $6 CONUS* in a [8""x8"" box, shipped securely in a bubble-wrapped sleeve](https://imgur.com/LFwpoe5).

&nbsp;

*If you are planning to use one of these cables with a high-demand board like an HHKB, CTRL, or ALT, it may not power the board properly. I unfortunately do not have any of these boards on hand for testing.*","[US-IN][H] Curlicue Cables Batch 2 | White/Black & Mizu Coiled + Detachable Cables, Ready to Ship [W] PayPal"

REDUCED PRICES TO SELL SELL SELL!

I'm trying to sell all of the keyboards and things that I'm not using so that I can pay for something important next month. I've had the Masterkeys Pro S for a year,  the Anne Pro 2 for 3 months and the Code V2 since last November. The Anne Pro 2 and keycaps come with their original cases, but the Masterkeys and Code V2 do not.

I'm not selling the gemstone keycap on the top board. Anne Pro 2 has Kalih Box Brown switches and the Pro S has Cherry Mx Blue switches, Code V2 has Cherry MX Clears. The Bluetooth on the Pro 2 works perfectly. I'm a writer and I can attest that it doesn't drop any keys even when I'm typing very fast. Oh, and Coolermaster and Anne Pro keyboards have RGB lighting. Code V2 has White backlight.

Prices:

**Anne Pro 2 - $80 CDN SOLD**

** Masterkeys Pro S - $130 CDN - RESERVED **

Ninja Keycaps (as shown on Code V2) - $30 CDN

Code V2 - $120 CDN

Side Printed Black keycaps (for Code V2) - $10 CDN

Looking to trade my built Space65 R2 Schrodinger (Without keycaps) for a Hotswap Vega or Voice. Not too picky on colors, however if you’re interested, pm me with the specs/condition of the board and anything else you deem necessary. **Prioritizing a Vega or a unbuilt Voice** 

Specs for the Space65

-Lubed Durock V2 Stabs (could use a bit of fine tuning for the space bar, will recommend the holee mod)

-Lubed/Filmed Alpacas built on a carbon fiber plate 

-Flawless 10/10 condition on the exterior part of the board, interior is also very good. 

-Will ship in original packaging 

-Pink LED Badge

If there are any other 65% boards you deem worthy of a trade or similar in value a pm won’t hurt! I’m also open to trading the board with GMK 8008+ Accents if you have a GMK set to trade as well.

Hoping to move some stuff I have sitting around taking up space to fund some purchases I've made, as well as look for some pieces that I've been after.

**Prices are shipped CONUS, please comment before PM'ing, chats will be ignored, not FCFS, prefer bundles/local/trades. Thank you!**

~~**GH60 build.** Wooden case made by /u/lxkhn. One of the inserts has pulled out but doesn't effect the security as there are 5 others. The insert and screw are both included, along with the rest of the hardware.~~ 

~~Mini-USB PCB with mill-max sockets to make it hotswappable. Stabilizers included (GMK Screw-in). Apparently one of the screws off the spacebar stabilizer was lost at some point, but doesn't seem to make a difference, as I never noticed, just mentioning for full transparency.~~ 

~~Plate is silver aluminum, and also included are two pieces of mk-ultra case foam to dampen the noise from the case a bit. Easily removable if you end up not wanting it, just slips in under the PCB. All you need to complete this board are switches and a cable (see below for some options) **Asking $80 shipped CONUS OBO**~~ **SOLD**

**NYM96.** I want to stress up front that this board is being sold **as-is**. The USB-C port was pulled off the PCB, and I was unable to successfully remount it. The board was working perfectly fine before that, so I have to assume that nothing else is wrong with it at this point. If you think you'd be able to sell me a service and fix it for me, I'd be willing to hear you out on pricing, as I don't dislike the board, just can't fix it myself.

Please look up the keyboard for specifics on it's construction/design. Hotswappable, comes without stabilizers but is band-aid modded. Stabilizers can be added for extra.  **~~$90~~ $80 shipped CONUS OBO**

**Holy Trash Pandas x62** Lot of 62 switches, YOK Trash Panda housings, Sprit 65g springs, housings and springs lubed with Trib 3203. Prefer to trade these for another set of switches, maybe linears? hmu **~~$80~~ $75 shipped CONUS**

**BOX Royals x70** Lot of 70 switches. 10 of these are lubed, I don't know what with, and the other 60 are stock. **~~$28~~ $24 shipped CONUS**

**TRADES** 

As mentioned above, looking for a good number of nice switches to fill out a big board, as well as any keysets (GMK preferred) you may be interested in trading for anything above. Can add a bit to even out, but not looking to outright purchase anything at this time. 

Thanks for reading if you've gotten this far, I appreciate it, enjoy a cat picture in the timestamp album.","[US-VA] [H] Switches, GH60 w/ Wood Case, NYM96 as-is (Prices Reduced) [W] Verified Paypal, Trades"

The keyboard is lightly used.

RAMA M65-B is brand new and was only taken out to do some inspections and make sure it was the right color and what not. The board is in the Moon colorway, has a solder PCB, and comes with an internal dampener. The top right corner has a slight anode discoloration mark and the bottom edges have some issues (timestamps document these problems).

Black Duck TC- V3 built with Zealios V2s and GMK screw in stabilizers in a silver alu plate. There are two marks with one being on the back side and the other being on the right corner. Pictures are in the album. Board will be sold without the caps in the pictures and shipped in just a normal brown box with a lot of bubble wrap since that is how it got to original buyers.

This was my first ever keyboard but didn't see a lot of use maybe 3 months at most. It was very lightly lubed on the stems with a thin brush from the top. It is also missing costar stabilizer on backspace key. Other than that it works perfect and is in like new condition.

I wanted to sell some stuff, I don’t need anymore:

Kbdfans Tofu60 in black, bm60 hotswap pcb with arrow layout, comes with gmk screw in stabs which are lubed with 205g0 and bandaid modded.... Very good condition, but the Tofu is starting to get those little dots because of the backlight of the pcb. This isn’t visible at all from the outside or smth...
I put some neopren foam inside for better sound...

Heyo mm,

I like to lube/film switches in my free time/as I watch shows as it is therapeutic and helps pass the time (plus the bonus of getting to physically feel and hear the switch, so lmk if you want an honest review before you buy). I want to provide modded switches at an affordable price but can be flexible. My pricing is typically the MSRP of the switch + $.30 for lubing and $.05 for adding film. Shipping is additional at $4 for CONUS.

Also have a BNIB GMK VoC lying around.

**Disclaimer:** For the switch sets, I know there is enough for a 65% board but I also know that a select few are dead or not responsive. I will not be testing all of the switches so buy at your own risk!

Looking to trade this Space65 for a Vega thats hotswap,or a unbuilt Hotswap voice65 just pm me the board specs and colorway etc. (I will be keeping this GMK set unless you are trading one as well). 

This board is in flawless condition, I can make a sound test upon request along with other pictures. 

-Built on a Carbon Fiber plate, with Lubed and filmed alpacas, as well as durock v2 stabs. 

-Pink LED Badge

-Will ship in original packaging

-IMO the stabs could be redone, I purchased this off MM and it was built by a streamer and the space bar could use a little bit of work. However, I am pretty picky when it comes to how the board sounds, so that may just be me. It is not quite my taste as I would rather have a more deep and thocky sound. 


I will also trade for other 65% boards, pm me with colorway, condition, or anything that is worthy of mentioning. 

**If you’re trading a voice65 you will have to cover remainder with PayPal, if applicable**

Hey MechMarketeers,

Corona Virus had me unemployed for a bit, need to make up the difference via some of my boards that haven't seen enough use.

&#x200B;

For trades, I'm interested in;

\- 65-100% boards

\- SA keysets

\- Everything Topre (except artisans)

&#x200B;

LIGHT USE~~|~~I didn't pull any punches on this build. The board has been tuned for a smooth, light, and crisp feel while maintaining a subtle and soft tactility that isn't overly clicky. Everything turned out great! It's a breeze to type on and sounds remarkably clear yet not being overbearingly loud. The overall sound from the board is a balanced because of mods (foam, lube, film, etc). All the treatment this board got definitely paid off. Please note that you will only fall in love with the feel of this board if you like a more airy typing experience due to the lighter spring weight.~~|~~$285~~ **SOLD**|

Hoping to move some stuff I have sitting around taking up space to fund some purchases I've made, as well as look for some pieces that I've been after.

**Prices are shipped CONUS, please comment before PM'ing, chats will be ignored, not FCFS, prefer bundles/local/trades. Thank you!**

**GH60 build.** Wooden case made by /u/lxkhn. One of the inserts has pulled out but doesn't effect the security as there are 5 others. The insert and screw are both included, along with the rest of the hardware. 

Mini-USB PCB with mill-max sockets to make it hotswappable. Stabilizers included (GMK Screw-in). Apparently one of the screws off the spacebar stabilizer was lost at some point, but doesn't seem to make a difference, as I never noticed, just mentioning for full transparency. 

Plate is silver aluminum, and also included are two pieces of mk-ultra case foam to dampen the noise from the case a bit. Easily removable if you end up not wanting it, just slips in under the PCB. All you need to complete this board are switches and a cable (see below for some options) **Asking $100 shipped CONUS OBO**

**NYM96.** I want to stress up front that this board is being sold **as-is**. The USB-C port was pulled off the PCB, and I was unable to successfully remount it. The board was working perfectly fine before that, so I have to assume that nothing else is wrong with it at this point. If you think you'd be able to sell me a service and fix it for me, I'd be willing to hear you out on pricing, as I don't dislike the board, just can't fix it myself.

Please look up the keyboard for specifics on it's construction/design. Hotswappable, comes without stabilizers but is band-aid modded. Stabilizers can be added for extra.  **$90 shipped CONUS**

**Holy Trash Pandas x62** Lot of 62 switches, YOK Trash Panda housings, Sprit 65g springs, housings and springs lubed with Trib 3203. Prefer to trade these for another set of switches, maybe linears? hmu **$80 shipped CONUS**

**BOX Royals x70** Lot of 70 switches. 10 of these are lubed, I don't know what with, and the other 60 are stock. **$28 shipped CONUS**

**TRADES** 

As mentioned above, looking for a good number of nice switches to fill out a big board, as well as any keysets (GMK preferred) you may be interested in trading for anything above. Can add a bit to even out, but not looking to outright purchase anything at this time. 

Thanks for reading if you've gotten this far, I appreciate it, enjoy a cat picture in the timestamp album.","[US-VA] [H] Switches, GH60 w/ Wood Case, NYM96 as-is [W] Verified Paypal, Trades"

~~I have a set of GMK Striker I would like to trade for GMK Olive (not Olivia).~~

I bought used locally but the previous only mounted them and I did the same so there is little to no use.

Condition - Please read! There is no shine however, I think the previous owner mounted on Kailh box switches or something. The main alphas feel stretched and the T cap stem was cracked which I superglued. They are not so lose that they fall off when you flip your board but it is not tight like normal. The mods feel better. Seems like it was mounted on a HHKB or 65%. I mounted on a 75% and the F keys were fine.

Note, Striker Rd2 starts next month.

Not FCFS - priority to local and condition. Will require timestamp and photos of your set. Please comment here first and then DM. No chat please.

sold ~~Hi All - Have a fun one for you here today, as I know this board has been in high demand. I'm selling a Voice65, brand new just built. To be honest, I personally didn't love how it sounded, so I'm looking to sell it. It is a beautiful board, and for those that like a slightly lighter sound profile it's perfect. Happy to provide sound test upon request. The board is built with Lavender C3 Stabs (Rose Gold Wire), lubed with 205g0 and Silicon Lube. The board is soldered with lubed Gateron Ink Blacks, the mute sound piece, the back foam, and the ESG reduction piece. I would be open to selling it either with, or without, the GMK Phosphorus keycap set currently on the board - I'm looking for $615, shipped, for the built board, or $865 for the bundle. Hoping that this is a good deal - between construction costs, costs of stabs, lube, and switches you're looking at around $100, so figure that values the board separately at around $515, which is the lowest I've recently seen.~~ 

~~Board also comes with the extra aluminum plate, and extra gaskets. This will not be FCFS necessarily, and bundling takes priority. No trades ATM, so please do not offer them.~~ 

Switches:

1. Okomochi Switches x 70 (Tactile ,67g springs, POM stem, Nylon housing) - $65, USD shipped

RAMA M65-B is brand new and was only taken out to do some inspections and make sure it was the right color and what not. The board is in the Moon colorway, has a solder PCB, and comes with an internal dampener. The top right corner has a slight anode discoloration mark and the bottom edges have some issues (timestamps document these problems).

Black Duck TC- V3 built with Zealios V2s and GMK screw in stabilizers in a silver alu plate. There are two marks with one being on the back side and the other being on the right corner. Pictures are in the album. Board will be sold without the caps in the pictures and shipped in just a normal brown box with a lot of bubble wrap since that is how it got to original buyers.

Square 80 is basically flawless besides some machining marks in the ""exhaust"" area that you can see through the coating. The yellow I would say is more a mango in real life than what it looks like in the pictures but not by much. It has a hotswap PCB and is not sold with the caps and switches in the pictures.

SA Laser has Gaijin alphas, Obnet mods, 7u space, Mitowaves novelties, and numpad and was never used and will not split kits.

GMK Stabilizers installed as well as Mill-max sockets in current PCB, so it is hot swappable. One of the sockets pads on the PCB was removed out, so I installed a jumper [seen here, between keys 3 and 4](http://imgur.com/gallery/TeqFDEU). It works perfectly, and there is also an unused PCB as well if you need. \[$550\]

|89 x lubed Penguin tactile switches|Bought from Kinetic Labs. Lubed with Krytox 205g0 and springs were lubed with Krytox GPL 105. Not going to lie, 205g0 was the wrong move because I over lubed them. But also, not a big fan of these. Keeping one for the collection as well.|$60 + shipping|
|~~71 x lubed Glorious Pandas~~|~~Bought from Glorious. Lightly lubed with Krytox 205g0. Did a lubing job on these than those Penguins, that's for sure.

2. JTK Vostok-1 full kit (base + Latin alpha + novelties), BNIB. $270 shipped.
3. Drop Shift barebones kit. Comes with original box and all accessories(cable, keycap puller, switch puller, feet). Swapped stabs with ZealPC Genuine Cherry stabs and band-aid modded. No rattles on stabs now. Used for less than 5 hours. Want to let go because the board is still a little too big for my tiny work desk. And I've acquired a lot of other boards lately so need some funds. Originally bought to try out 1800 layout. Board itself is flawless. Price is $190 shipped within CONUS. Warning: Barebones means it does ***NOT*** comes with switches or keycaps.
4. Drop + RedSuns GMK Red Samurai Keycap Set 1800 Kit. Used for only 1 hour cuz it arrived much later than the Drop Shift and I have no other 1800 board so selling together with the board. Basically new, no shine. Price is ~~$130~~ $110 (updated price to match Amazon before tax price) shipped within CONUS. Highly preferred selling with the board.

Hi All - Have a fun for you here today, as I know this board has been in high demand. I'm selling a Voice65, brand new just built. To be honest, I personally didn't love how it sounded, so I'm looking to sell it. It is a beautiful board, and for those that like a slightly lighter sound profile it's perfect. Happy to provide sound test upon request. The board is built with Lavender C3 Stabs (Rose Gold Wire), lubed with 205g0 and Silicon Lube. The board is soldered with lubed Gateron Ink Blacks, the mute sound piece, the back foam, and the ESG reduction piece. I would be open to selling it either with, or without, the GMK Phosphorus keycap set currently on the board - I'm looking for $625, shipped, for the built board, or $875 for the bundle. Board also comes with the extra aluminum plate, and extra gaskets. This will not be FCFS necessarily, and bundling takes priority. No trades ATM, so please do not offer them. 

Switches:

1. SOLD. Wuque Studio Original Aspiration Switches x 110 (67g gold spring, PC top, UHMWPE bottom, POM stem, No factory Lube) - $65, shipped

2. Okomochi Switches x 70 (Tactile ,67g springs, POM stem, Nylon housing) - $65, USD shipped

Let me know if you have any questions, and happy to discuss anything. Hope you're all well.","[US-NY] [H] Voice65 E-White Bundle, Switches [W] Paypal"

Had these around for a while and decided I needed to get rid of them. The discipline is fully soldered and mostly working except that the pads for one or two resistors broke so that the corresponding key does not work. This should be easily fixed if you have the soldering experience I lack. The kit itself comes with full ponoko parts with either clear or smoky acrylic tops (one of each available) as well as an FR4 plate, GMK stabilizers, and the necessary screws. Extra resistors will be provided as well. The kbd67mkii parts are both from KBDfans and not used anymore.

Looking for 100 for each discipline kit and 35 for both the foam and brass plate. Does not include shipping.

Black Duck TC- V3 built with Zealios V2s and GMK screw in stabilizers in a silver alu plate. There are two marks with one being on the back side and the other being on the right corner. Pictures are in the album. Board will be sold without the caps in the pictures and shipped in just a normal brown box with a lot of bubble wrap since that is how it got to original buyers.

Square 80 is basically flawless besides some machining marks in the ""exhaust"" area that you can see through the coating. The yellow I would say is more a mango in real life than what it looks like in the pictures but not by much. It has a hotswap PCB and is not sold with the caps and switches in the pictures.

SA Laser has Gaijin alphas, Obnet mods, 7u space, Mitowaves novelties, and numpad and was never used and will not split kits.

I'm pretty new to this subreddit, so please let me know if I formatted the post wrong!

I bought the GMK Redacted Deskpad a few months ago with a particular setup in mind, but after it arrived today, I found it didn't quite fit the aesthetic I was going for.

The deskpad is brand new, and I'm looking to sell it for $40 shipped to anyone within the US.

Mitolet - Self Explanatory, used VERY lightly. I don't see any shine anywwhere. Some damage to storage tray / box - $130 shipped obo

Keypad - SO for those of you who don't know, this keypad doesn't ACTUALLY send numpad signals by default. It sends number row. To fix this, I decided to desolder it, hand wire in a teensy. Then I added a USB C converter. notice that some switches had to be hot glued in to get them to stay. That being said, it has worked flawlessly, and offers some pretty unique functionality IMO. Will come with Original keycaps, not the ones pictured I think I have the original PCB as well, though i'm not sure if it was damaged in desoldering or not, I was never planning on reusing it. - IDK, $90 shipped? They are 70 new, but this one is programmable and has a removable cable, but its not the CLEANEST implementation...Idk. Send me an offer.

Got rid of all my previous boards recently in preparation for my endgame project and... the prebuilt I was using in the meantime just died on me yesterday and won't work. **I'm looking to buy or trade for a KBDFans 8X (or something similar): it has to be silver and WKL.

> ❧ **TO ALL US CITIZENS**: for reasons out of my hands, shipping has been increased from $16 to $40 (basically the price of boxes up to 2kg). I hate it and I'm willing to work with you, but that makes buying 1 single artisan really expensive, sorry :'( I am willing to work with you on that though, so don't let that affraid you.

Hello!!

I am looking to donate some cash from this sale to a local cat rescuer, can view her instagram at [.@fioloh](https://www.instagram.com/fioloh/?hl=en). She has been helping many stray cats/dogs (mainly cats) find homes, seek medical help (including surgeries) as well as helping to foster. I found her work really meaningful (especially because I like cats). Hence, I'll state 2 prices (just $10 difference), if you would like to help, you can opt to purchase the slightly more expensive price, it's perfectly okay if you don't want to. The donation will be publicly recorded at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asY5BAWSZ_pmxUy2jxmaSa1eHDddTiLQlEhGi1niuyw/edit#gid=1722981492), under tehbingg. I'll update here once donated. (I hope this is allowed by the mods, otherwise please let me know, I'll be willing to remove.)  Prior donations from previous sales have been made (can be seen in the spreadsheet).

All of these kits are sealed:)

This would not be FCFS as I would like to prioritize the donation prices to help a little more.

LIGHT USE|I didn't pull any punches on this build. The board has been tuned for a smooth, light, and crisp feel while maintaining a subtle and soft tactility that isn't overly clicky. Everything turned out great! It's a breeze to type on and sounds remarkably clear yet not being overbearingly loud. The overall sound from the board is a balanced because of mods (foam, lube, film, etc). All the treatment this board got definitely paid off. Please note that you will only fall in love with the feel of this board if you like a more airy typing experience due to the lighter spring weight.|$350|

|Leopold FC900R + DSA Just Beige (Base + Full Compatibility)|MX Browns. MODERATE USE|Really not interested in getting rid of this board unless the caps go with it. It's actually a pretty awesome board for being full size; Decent weight, sounds beautiful, feels authentic. I'd be willing to lube the stabs for you before I ship it out if you want.|$185|

**Red Samurai TKL ($65 Shipped in bags)**

I bought this from another redditor 6 months ago. There is some shine in alot of often used keys. There is also a big noticeable warp on the spacebar. There is a picture of it in timestamp.

**WASD CODE v2 TKL w/ Cherry Clears ($80 Shipped)** 

This was my first ever keyboard but didn't see a lot of use maybe 3 months at most. It was very lightly lubed on the stems with a thin brush from the top. It is also missing costar stabilizer on backspace key. Other than that it works perfectly and is in like new condition.

Disclaimer: this board was previously sold to another user and appears to have been damaged lightly in transit. It has some small areas of missing paint next to a screw on the bottom, aswell as in-between the case layers, this is purely cosmetic damage and none of it is on the top of the keyboard. If interested, I have pictures of the damaged areas. The board is priced accordingly. Looking for $550 shipped CONUS OBO

**OG Cherry WoB**

Includes only the keys shown. This will fit a typical 104-key full-size, TKL, or 60% with standard winkey bottom row. Only including the non-stepped Caps Lock only. The keys came from a Cherry G81-8000HPBUS-2-C and a G80-8200HUAUS-2.

Note that the black Windows keys are pad printed. All other keys are double shot.

Also including the dark gray double shot windows keys shown, which were made by JTK - I got those out of a JTK grab bag.

These were made by Cherry, on the same tooling that is now owned by GMK (Cherry sold their double shot tooling to GMK around 2011 or 2012).

Note that the white on OG Cherry double shot WoB is a bit creamier and more beige - seems to be somewhere between CP and L9. This is a bit more beige than the bright WS1 white you see on Drop's GMK WoB.","[US-MA] [H] GMK Nautilus 2 Core and Spacebar, OG Cherry WoB, ePBT Royal Alpha, Black (CR) GMK 7u spacebar [W] Paypal, Local Venmo, Local Cash"

Doing some decluttering, in advance of more stuff arriving soon! [Timestamp album](https://imgur.com/a/sDgWHUO)

I am located in Canada, but all of the prices below are in USD. The prices are all including shipping to Canada or the US. I'm happy to consider shipping elsewhere.

Some of these prices might budge, others might not. Feel free to make me a better offer if you think I've priced something too high -- I'm generally going by a combination of past mechmarket sales and how much it cost me for the item plus tax/shipping.

All items are unused. Some keycaps were mounted for photos, but none of these have been typed on for more than 15 minutes or so max.

I don't have boxes large enough for the old GMK trays on hand, so those keycaps will be sent in ziploc bags, sorry!

Leave a comment below before sending me a PM. Do **not** send me chats.

This is not FCFS. I'm heading to bed now and I'll deal with messages in the morning, so don't be alarmed if it takes some hours for me to get back to you.

Hello everyone!

Bought the GMK Nautilus 2 Core and Novelties sets thinking I was going to put them on a yellow keyboard...

Times have changed, preferences have changed. I still think this is a beautiful set, but I don't think I will be using this anytime soon. Don't plan on getting a black or yellow keyboard anytime soon. So it's up for sale for whoever wants it.

I will update accordingly IF I decide to split based on what people want.

Hey guys,

Selling my M60-A lake today.

It has the hot swap pcb, and is built with 55g Zilents and Zeal stabs.

Also comes with GMK Skidolcha enought to fit the M60-A no shine at all.

Selling this as I have now moved to the big chonker U80, and FN Keys is life.

Sorry wil no sell the board on its own, as I'll have no use for the keycaps.

Was recently purchased from r/mechmarket so asking what I paid for it, which is $1000 AUD for locals or $780 USD + Shipping worldwide.

I’ve got the GMK Phosphorus base kit, spacebars, and the super cool RAMA metal artisan cap. Set is pretty much unused with no hints of shine anywhere. 

I thought this set would be just what I wanted, but it’s just not quite as perfect of a fit as I thought it would be. I’d love to trade it for another cool set. If you had a matching artisan that would be even cooler, but it’s certainly not required. Would also sell for 400, but I’d prefer a trade for sure.

Hello guys!

&#x200B;

I am selling full keeb sets of Cherry vintage black switches from true Cherry G80 boards (G80-3405HPMCH/01 and G80-3036HPMCH/03 variants)

All boards (13 of them) are date codes D-G (1991-1994) Plus 2 boards are 1996 I date code G80-1800

&#x200B;

Boards were from a Swiss bank and were heavily used by bank clerks in a clean office environment.

All of the switches are very smooth and broken in with minor/no differences between rows, I would rate them 8-9/10 in smoothness.

They have been professionally desoldered and cleaned with a brush and air gun, but I would suggest when you mod them to wash the insides with warm soapy water.

&#x200B;

Alphas are separately packed from the rest so you can solder them like that back onto your project. (to retain 100% consistency)

&#x200B;

# 0/15 sets still avail.

  
**ALL SOLD!!!**

&#x200B;

**THANKS TO EVERYONE PARTICIPATING!**

&#x200B;

**Price: 110 €  per set + shipping**

**You will get 104 Vintage Blacks + 1 Vintage MX grey + full keeb set of Vintage GMK/Cherry stabs (clean or swap wires and they are the best stabs that you can use)**

&#x200B;

Shipping worldwide is possible. Approx. 10-15 €  for the EU package and 15-20 €  for Worldwide depending on the country.

All packages will be shipped with tracking and a Paypal invoice will be issued.

&#x200B;

\- Priority of sale goes to buyers of more sets.

\- Price is firm.

\- I will not split sets or the number of switches.

\- First cash in first package out, I will hold no reserves.

&#x200B;

Pls reply before PMing and you can also contact me via Discord @ ADRO3#7885

[timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/2rSWEHI)

Selling my DZ60 Rev3 board.
This build has lubed Gat blacks, lubed GMK stabilizers, aluminum plate, a white plastic 60% case from KBDfans, and YMDK DSA Profile 9009 caps with o-rings on them. Honestly, I'm not the best judge of keycap quality since I've never owned GMK or other high end caps, but these are really nice from my perspective. If you don't want the o-rings let me know. Happy to upload more pics as well. I love this board but the 75% size works better for my workflow.

Only oddity is the ""3"" switch can be slow to fire sometimes. I'd say it happens 10% of the time. I'm happy to reflow that switch if you'd like. Other than that it works beautifully.

I was going to build this as a linear WKL \[Alpacas\], but decided not to.

&#x200B;

So now you can benefit from my linear non-build, as I am waiving the duties that I incurred on this purchase.

This means you can purchase this keyboard now, *without paying the duties*. I am selling below cost.

&#x200B;

Without duties, the keyboard cost $420 USD to my door, so I am asking that plus shipping to Canada / CONUS. **$420 USD + shipping.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The kit comes with everything as stock - the case, brass weight, PCB, brass plate, and case foam.

&#x200B;

\------

I also have 2 extra plates from Project Keyboard, in case you want to try something else.

There is an FR4 plate and a polycarbonate plate. This is available as a combo with the keyboard, and costs $60 + shipping.

I am willing to throw in a separate shipment of GMK Taro R2 base \[all that is needed for the above photo\] for $140 USD + shipping. I might put it up for sale individually later, but the buyer of this kit gets first dibs.

~~Really unique keyboard designed for trading stocks and bonds. Switches are the smoothest Cherry MX Clears I have ever felt. Great stabilizers (made by GMK) and fantastic keycaps as you would expect from GMK. I don't think you can get the keycaps in this colorway other than on this keyboard. At least 6 individual profiles can be setup for different people or different uses, and can be toggled via the ""WS1 - 6"" keys. Comes with the WEY Modular Keyboard Connector Box V, keyboard connector cable, and USB cable. I'm told it's hard to find a working connector box, so I'm fortunate to have the whole package together and working (I'm actually typing this post on the keyboard and it's giving me second thoughts about selling it). Hard to let this one go, but I need to buy a new AC unit for my house before spring, so I'm slowly selling through the stuff I don't use.~~

The cases are a little different from what is recommended on Discipline Github its mostly made out of 3mm acrylic for the top, spacer and the bottom parts and the plate is 5mm (stab holes have been widened to accommodate).

A few months ago, I decided I really liked my aluminum KBD67 and wanted to give the Polycarbonate version a try to see which one I like better.  Of course after months of going back and forth between the two I still have no idea.  The PC goes better with more keycap sets, and the Aluminum feels more premium.  They both sound good but completely different.  No reason for me to keep holding on to both so I figured I'd let one fly.  When one goes the other is off the market.  **I'm willing to mix and match switches if you'd like the switches from the other board.**

~~KBD67 MKII Hotswap Polycarbonate Build - Comes built with stabs (I believe these are cherry) that have been lubed with Krytox 205g0.

I've hit the point I'm shoveling stuff up out of the keyset drawer to try to keep bills paid while the state still fucks around with us. Big thanks to anyone that's bought so far as that's going a decent way to keeping the household above water atm. Artisans are the same condition I've posted them in the past couple times now. Keysets read the condition really fucking carefully as there's a lot of details and I'm not taking the blame if you don't read. All prices are before shipping, which is calculated by buyer. All prices are OBO because I need this done with. I can provide detailed pictures on request, I just don't have the energy to get them right now.

__**Keysets**__

EPBT Royal Alpha(2) - $75 - https://imgur.com/nm8jm1g - Used, mounted on box switches; The first test set sent to me based on the kit of GMK RA 2. Some of the legends are kinda fucky because this was EPBT's normal legends before GOK fixed them for the set. 

GMK Monkey - $50; **SOLD** - https://imgur.com/c7Zxr0P - Used, abused, and then some; My first GMK set and it looks like it. Used to hell and back and then I tried clear-coat on the caps to bring back the fresh GMK feel, which some didn't react well to. **Don't** buy this set if you want something to look nice, buy it if you want to use like just the numbers and F-row keys for a macro pad or something, idk.

**EVERYTHING SOLD**

~~**ai03 Equinox:**~~ **SOLD**

WKL, dark grey, gasket pcb mount, (plateless) 5mm plate-foam, extra sealed pcb, lubed alpacas v2, durock stabs.

The equinox is actually my favorite board in terms of typing experience but the bottom row doesn't work for my forty layout (i have to use the 1u key as space to make it work).
It comes with a weird ISO-layout, built with 205g0 lubed and filmed (deskeys) alpacas v2 and 205g2 lubed durock stabs. 
I can make small modifications to the layout or include extra lubed switches if you want. I can also desolder everything and keep the switches and stabs (no discount).

I am the second owner and had to import the board from US, because it's almost impossible to get an Equinox in EU (less than 30 total units sold). However, there are no flaws whatsoever except for one rounded screw in the inside (invisible from outside and now below foam).

After receiving the board i was kinda underwhelmed by it's flex. It being a plateless pcb gasket mount i was expecting a lot more flex. Most of the (stock) flex actually originates from it's rubber feet and the stock gaskets are way too hard.
So i had to experiment with custom gaskets. I ended up using 1.5mm neoprene sponge strips as gaskets and added <1mm EVA foam in the bottom to prevent the pcb hitting the bottom due to the increased flex (prevent shortage).
In combination with the custom 5mm plate-foam (cut by worldspawn) the board has a very nice sound signature and the best typing experience that i've come across so far.
I will also include the stock gaskets (don't use them tho!) and I can also include extra gasket materials if you like to experiment yourself.

It will be shipped inside a nice padded carrying case, that i've received [broken](https://i.imgur.com/X3GLbSk.jpg) from aliexpress.

~~**Sneakbox Prime_Elise:**~~ **SOLD**

I got 2 cases: frosted PC and grey aluminium. I want to keep the alu bottom half.
So you can either buy either full PC, or PC bottom + alu top (mixed).
It comes with a walnut wrist rest (a-stock) and a black (gb exclusive) rev. 2 prime_e pcb (no hotswap, no rgb).

You can choose between 2 builds:

- custom PC plate (clear), 205g0 lubed and deskeys filmed H1s (jwk linear), gmk screw-in stabs lubed with 205g2 and clipped
- custom PC plate (clear), 205g0 lubed and tx filmed tangerines 67g v2 (jwk linear), c3 tangerine stabs lubed with 205g2

I will also include a new black FR4 plate (also custom made). These can also be sold separately for very cheap as i have a bunch of them.

It also comes with custom gaskets (2mm EPDM, see timestamp), that can easily be removed if you don't like the extra flex and softer typing experience. I can also include extra gasket materials if you like to experiment yourself.

Shipped inside original sneakbox labeled packaging.

Mixed Build has priority, as i would prefer to keep the PC top.


~~**GMK Oblivion:**~~ **SOLD**

GMK Oblivion v2 Regular Base Kit + Oblivion Cadet.

I am the second owner. According to previous owner it was only mounted once and the cadet set is brand new. 
I mounted both sets and did probably around 5 typing tests in total on the equinox (a 40% keyboard). There is no shine or flaws whatsoever.

I would love to sell this board as a bundle but we’ll see what offers I get! Anyways the board is built with lubed and filmed JWK Moss switches and Smokey Durock Stabs. It currently has a FR4 Plate, but it came with brass. The keycaps are NK BoW. **DOES NOT COME WITH CABLE**

I’m going to ask $425 for the whole board including everything listed but if would want to bargain, just pm I’m open to dropping the price a little bit.

Hi,

I'm selling my OG GMK Laser set. I'm just not feeling it like I used to.

Will ship the base kit in the tray and box (haven't peeled the box open to see the poster)

Blocknet and Mitowaves will ship in ziplocs

I'm including the artisan that came with the laser alt and an extra 6u laser spacebar. I have them and have no use for them so I figured I'd just throw them in.

Set has been used but looks good

Bundle $400 usd shipped (price is negotiable)
Base kit $300
Blocknet $60
Mitowaves $60

Hi MM,

&#x200B;

Looking to sell these two kits. The GMK 8008 base + accents are both unopened and sealed.

&#x200B;

The Mizu was lightly used for <1 month, and mostly was just used for photos and aesthetics, barely typed on. I haven’t used them in around 6 months, so really just want to pass them on to someone else. I would say no / very little shine on alphas, and the other keys haven’t really been touched. Don’t have the tray or box on the Mizu, so its shipped in bags. Prices are below

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Bad Daffy v2 Laser
Playyd Sonic the Hedghog
Artkey OG Bearlot
JAK Mushrooms x2

Lemme now if you’re interested at all and shoot me any offers you got. since Im sort of out of the game from looking at new or old cap releases, I honestly don’t have much of an idea for what Im looking for. i do just aee that adorable Noel Sirus pupper cap that looks amazing, but would also be interested in a Frozen or Og Froper to trade my DFA for!(:

Due to setup modifications, taste changes quite quickly, so I would like to sell the GMK MoonDust set:

If you want some day light pictures, or further infomation just message me on discord:  marcelhennix#6333.

The whitish moon color really depends on the lighting situation and it's therefore hard to capture correctly!

Bought a clueboard a bit ago to replace my dz60 that crapped out on me, but I finally rebuilt it, so I have no more need for the Clueboard. 

I also got the GMK Godspeeds in Armstrong with its novelties in the mail but unfortunately, I am no longer a fan of the colorway. Details on the Clueboard as follows.

Looking to sell a built Clueboard v3/v4 which I got off another user here. Details of the build are as follows -

    Clueboard v3/v4 Grey Alu Top and Bottom with acrylic diffuser
    Clueboard PCB (mini USB) soldered with -
        Chellow switches (retooled Cherry housing with Gateron yellow stem and spring lubed with Krytox 205g0 for the stem, legs, housing and spring) on alphas and numbers
        Retooled Cherry MX black switches on the modifiers (lubed with Krytox 205g0 for the stem, legs, housing and spring)
        1x Durock screw-in purple and gold stab for the spacebar (lubed with Krytox 205g0)
        2x GMK screw-in stabs for the enter key and left shift key (lube with Krytox 205g0)
        PCB is configured as split backspace, split right shift, and the bottom row is ==> (1.25)(1.25)(1.25)(6.25)(1.25)(1)(1.25)
    Clueboard acrylic bottom (Extra)
    KBDFans XDA keycap set (All extra keycaps will be included)
    Screw-In Stabilizers from Tokyo60 (2 x 2u and 1 x 7u) (Extra add on)
    Wood Cable Mini USB to USB-A (5 feet, Mini USB to USB-A, Gray Heatshrink, Cream Paracord, and Clear Techflex)
    2x Neoprene foam cut out and placed below the PCB for sound dampening. Keyboard goes thocc thocc.

**Note: The clueboard has a small scuff (pictured in the timestamp) in the front. Received the board in this condition. There are no other scuffs or dings on the board. Also from the previous owner - ""**One thing to note is that I tried fixing one of the underglow LEDs since it was not working but ended up lifting some of the pads.""

SOLD FOR ASKING PRICE!!!!!

Still looking to sell my Bauer. One of my favorite boards but I am ready to move on from it. I am only wanting to ship CONUS. If you have any questions or want more photos please let me know. Thanks

DixieMech (Omnitype) Bauer: Color is Grey/Cyan. Has the tiniest ding in the lower right corner, only on the finish not on the paint so it would be easily fixable if it bothered you. Priced to accommodate fixing this issue if someone wants to do so. Comes with a millmaxed PCB so it is hotswapable. Comes with a pc plate and aluminum plate. Has lubed durock stabs installed that will come with. Price does not include switches or keycaps but if you do like the GMK Oblivion set on there we could work out something to include those if you’d like. Priced to sell as I am trying to finish paying off some wedding things.

Hi,

Prices below do not include shipping. I will be shipping from 90293. Also down for in-person transactions.



Name | Price | Description
---|---|----
~~Exclusive E8.5~~| ~~$645~~ | ~~E-Black with polycarbonate plate, interior foam, brass accent piece and brass weight. It comes with two O-rings and the original box and stickers. This is a built with lubed Novelkey Creams and Durock stabilizers. These creams are super broken in and smooth as I've owned them for over 2 years and swapped them around on my daily drivers. I soldered mill-max sockets into this board, except one key I accidently soldered the switch into the mill-max socket. Someone more skilled/equipped than me should be able to desolder it. However, if you don't plan on desoldering the board, this has no effect on you and the board itself is 100% operational and working. I paid $564.81 retail + $58.50 for switches. Does not come with keycaps. The switches alone are probably worth $100.~~ **LOCAL SALE**

Hi guys, I have a Grey KBD MkII for sale. Here are the specs.

KBD67 MkII Hotswap ($300 shipped) - O Ringed in contact points of the board to make it a more soft typing experience and less stiff. The o rings are between the top and bottom case, pcb and plate. The sound actually improved a bunch and sounds much nicer. It comes with ultramarine switches (JWK) lubed with krytox 205g0 as well as smokey durock stabs lubed with the same lube. Hotswap pcb, brass plate & weight, both case and pcb/plate foam included. And oh, it’s in great condition almost perfect, the plate has some minor scratches but other than that, it’s perfect.

Also, I’m interested in keycap sets (JTK, Infinikey, GMK, EPBT). I’m a bit lacking in sets so I would love to trade! I’m also currently looking for an Alice style layout to try. Thanks!","[US-MO] [H] Grey KBD67 MkII w/ Lubed Mekanisk Ultramarine Switches [W] PayPal, Keycap Sets, Alice style boards"

Hi All - Group buys have been rolling in for the past few months and looking to offload a few things that I am not going to end up keeping, as well as this beautiful Chimera65 that I just don't have room for / could use the money elsewhere atm. Priorities will go to bundles. Feel free to PM to discuss / for more info. 


SOLD w Keycaps and artisans. First up is the Chimera65. I would say the exterior is pretty close to flawless to my eye, save for some very minor normal wear and tear, but happy to take closer photos of anything in specific. It got used daily for about 2 months before being swapped out for a TKL. Please note that the POM plate that the board was built with got mildly warped in transit, and, because of that, the keyboard is very slightly not level on the edges. I included a photo to show this. It's very minor, and doesn't affect typing. Board is built with Lubed Gateron Ink Blacks. The extras should be running sometime soon-ish, so you could pick up a replacement plate and PCB pretty easily then. I am only looking to sell it bundled with GMK Rudy base. I am only looking for two things for this board: 1) $2000 Paypal + shipping / insurance (what I hope is a pretty fair deal as I saw one sell for $1800 recently, and this includes a $300 keycap set), or 2) Interesting gasket mounted keyboards in the ~$600 - $1300 price range. I'm somewhat flexible here, but not interested in anything KBDFans etc (as much as I love their stuff). Feel free to hit me with any question / to throw an offer out there. I won't be mean! I would prefer not to include artisans, but something could definitely be worked out if you're interested. Ships with case. 


SOLD. Second item is the [Mark65 keyboard](https://imgur.com/a/mlJ44oQ), which just shipped its group buy. As you can see, the keyboard looks great. I have it in the darker grey colorway. Keyboard is gasket mount, has a hotswap PCB, an FR4 plate, and the additional 5 degree typing angle case option. The kit was opened and assembled / tested for literally 5 minutes, but is otherwise completely unused. Comes dissasembled, and I'll package everything separately within for safety (currently in the stuff my Mode80 came in). I'm looking to get $330 + shipping here, which I hope is fair. Board is a great intro option for anyone looking to get into gasket mounted boards immediately for a reasonable price. If you're getting into the hobby, and are interested in this as a starter keyboard, but have any questions / need lube, brushes, switches, etc... let me know. Happy to help out, and have a lot of stuff I'm happy to throw in for free / discounted to help you get started! Some switches not listed in the post (Yellows, JWK Linears, etc). 


Switches:

1. Wuque Studio Original Aspiration Switches x 110 (67g gold spring, PC top, UHMWPE bottom, POM stem, No factory Lube) - $75, shipped

2. Okomochi Switches x 70 (Tactile ,67g springs, POM stem, Nylon housing) - $70, USD shipped

I've hit the point I'm shoveling stuff up out of the keyset drawer to try to keep bills paid while the state still fucks around with us. Big thanks to anyone that's bought so far as that's going a decent way to keeping the household above water atm. Artisans are the same condition I've posted them in the past couple times now. Keysets read the condition really fucking carefully as there's a lot of details and I'm not taking the blame if you don't read. All prices are before shipping, which is calculated by buyer. All prices are OBO because I need this done with. I can provide detailed pictures on request, I just don't have the energy to get them right now.

__**Artisans**__

https://i.imgur.com/Zf7hqUj.jpg Artisans visual guide

Krytone Chickeys - $20/ea - Some are Krytone's aforementioned Topre/MX stems, some are MX only, as labeled in the timestamps. Part of my overall Krytone-centric collection. 

SUK Snapper ""Roastmallow""  - $40 - MX stem. My first artisan raffle win I've held onto almost four years now.

__**Keysets**__

EPBT Royal Alpha(2) - $75 - https://imgur.com/nm8jm1g - Used, mounted on box switches; The first test set sent to me based on the kit of GMK RA 2. Some of the legends are kinda fucky because this was EPBT's normal legends before GOK fixed them for the set. 

GMK Monkey - $50 - https://imgur.com/c7Zxr0P - Used, abused, and then some; My first GMK set and it looks like it. Used to hell and back and then I tried clear-coat on the caps to bring back the fresh GMK feel, which some didn't react well to. **Don't** buy this set if you want something to look nice, buy it if you want to use like just the numbers and F-row keys for a macro pad or something, idk.

SA Carbon R2 - $175 - https://imgur.com/BhP1TVD - Used, mounted on box switches; Alphas, Bone mods, Bone mod extension, Bone numpad; Fairly well used, one of the sets I'm more hesitant to let go and priced such.

$300 + shipping (CONUS)

Selling my SC Alice. Comes with matching SC wrist rest and feet. I sanded the wrist rest to remove the hard edges and sanded some slight indentations for comfort. It could still use a pass with higher grit sandpaper to remove scratches (only visible with certain lighting/angle). I also lifted a pad when desoldering a bad switch, so I had to bridge the ""N"" key. Keyboard is still fully functional and condition is great other than the previously mentioned.

The build will come with lubed and filmed Durock L7 linear (67g, desk keys films, 205g0), Durock screw-in stabs and Drop GMK WoB (little shine).

Shipping only to CONUS, will ship keycaps in bag, unless buyer wants to pay extra for shipping the keycaps in the GMK box.

Thanks!

Hey everyone,

Selling my Skog to go towards a cnc machine to make some more projects that I'm interested in. I am selling it only as a bundle or the keyboard by itself with the sleeve. I will not sell the Merlin set by itself, only with the keyboard so please don't ask. The merlin set comes with the novelties and the keyboard has the custom sleeve and keyboard stand (that I sell on my website). The sleeve has my logo on the other side so if you don't want the sleeve that's totally fine.

Specs: Skog TKL

* Lubed and filmed Tealios (sounds like and feels like a dream to type on)
* Lubed Durock stabs

FS is a space grey Drop Alt w/GMK Red Samurai Keycaps and Maroon YOK Pandas. No noticeable shine on the keys, I built this and used for a week before I built another board that I’ve been using primarily.

Replaced stock stabs with Zeal PC Cherry Gold plated stabs, that were cut and lubed.

Has [u/stupidfish1](https://www.reddit.com/u/stupidfish1/) foam installed, also included.

So after more than a year, my Thermal finally came in, but by now the hype was gone, I don't need it anymore and can't justify owning this many boards. However, since it's the hotswap board, I still wanted to build it, to see how a Rama board builds, how the plate is isolated (as it was advertised), etc...

I also have Monochrome that I literally used once for a typing test and picture on my Dolch.CR, then put back in the tray and never used again. So I guess it can go as well.

&#x200B;

Let's recap:

|Item|Condition|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**KURO** Hotswap **Thermal + extra HALT plate.** Built once (so pads are in) then disassembled.|Only built once, pristine condition, no scratches, nothing missing, check the timestamps|750€ + shipping|
|**~~GMK Monochrome + Extras kit. Opened, in tray.~~**|~~Bought sealed from~~ u/barpl ~~2 years ago. Perfect condition, used for a typing test and a picture, that's it.~~|~~210€ + shipping~~|

**UPDATE:** Monochrome isn't available anymore. I decided to not sell it after all, sorry everyone :(  
Also I'm not selling the plate alone for the Thermal, it's a bundle.

If it's not crossed out, it's available ! And no, I can't split the base kit and the extras for Monochrome.

&#x200B;

**Price is in euros** because well, I'm in Europe, and I also prioritize European buyers because that means no customs.

*Edit: Also I took my sweet time to make the post so while the pictures date from Sunday, they are still relevant. I can provide updated timestamps via PMs if you so desire.*","[EU-FR] [H] KURO Thermal + Extra HALT plate, GMK Monochrome + Extras [W] Paypal"

Hey,

I've been quite tight on time as of recent and so I'm finally here to sell off a few of my old builds. Prices include shipping fees (and paypal fees as always).

~~Tofu60 Black - £115 - holy panda switches lubed with superlube + syncolon oil mix (slightly thick, I would say an okay / beginners lube job). screw in gmk stabs lubed w dielectric grease, spacebar surprisingly really good sounding and the caps used are a set of epbt WOB that I've just put on.  Also there is a jumper on the back of the gh60 pcb connecting the A key to the S as I had burned off the pad :p. also reminds me, the caps lock key had the same happen to it and I didn't get around to doing the same as the A key. can do if requested, no problem. Hopefully this price is fair and if not do feel free to send me what you feel like is a fair price and I'll get back to you when I can.~~ **~~Sold for £115~~**

Tofu65 Black - £190 - Tealios v2 filmed w kebos and lubed with thinner superlube mix & just the syncolon oil on the springs (this is a much better lubing job as I started getting the hang of it. imo these switches sound really good as they are now. note that a few have suffered a damaged part to the top housing where the led shines through (roughly 5 switches). screw in stabs lubed same as above. dz65 v2 rgb per led.  ~~I think these are a fake/remade set of the gmk camping caps.~~ They look nice and feel good to type on. They are better than the epbt set imo. case was purchased from mm and was scuffed and not stated unfortunately. paid £110 for the case and £70 for the pcb w shipping included, trying to get anything around £200 back if possible hoping that the ~~caps (£40)~~, stabs (£10), switches (£50), plate (£20) etc on top will help with that. Paid around £280. Again please feel more than free to send in offers.

YC66 - £90 - drop halo clear switches lightly lubed by previous owner w krytox 205g0 - hotswap, plate mount stabs, lubed and these stabs are the best sounding of all 4 boards. A few novelkey creams on the mods  (here and there). Generic yellow shine through keycaps. RGB is very bright if you're into that.

~~KBDfans Acrylic - £100 - NovelKey creams lubed w krytox 205g0 (syncolon oil on the springs). Clip in stabs lubed w dielectric grease. sound dampening added to the case where it does not interfere w the leds. dz60 underglow rgb.~~ **~~sold for £95~~**

Really hope I covered everything, apologies if I haven't I've typed this out with a bad headache. Please do ask for anything you'd like to know and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thank you for reading <3

* Got these as part of the Thermal starter pack but I no longer need them as I already have inks.  They're brand new in package basically, I opened them to verify I received 70.

1. 46x C3 Tangerines V1 Rev2 (Gateron) - ~~$30.00~~ **SOLD**

* Left overs from my Prime\_e build.  These are the Gateron milky top black bottom and orange stem version of the tangerines, from the Rev2 round that TKC had in 2019.  These are stock as well.

3. Brutal60 Tsangan POM plate -  ~~$30.00~~ **SOLD**

* Plate is super flexible and provided a good typing experience while on my Brutal but not my personal favorite.  The black POM looks a little dirty but that seems to be the nature of the colored material itself.  This is Tsangan layout.  Please note, the switch cutouts don't seem to fit some switches as well as others.  I tried JWK and Gateron switches and JWK switches felt like they were tighter in the plate compared to Gateron switches.  I'm sure Cherry would fit differently than these two and so on.

4. HK Gaming 9009 Keycap set - ~~$40.00~~ **SOLD**

* Like new, I mounted it on my prime\_e build originally but didn't really enjoy the layout as I'm not a 40s user and the keycaps provided decent coverage but not exact.  I believe there is 139 keys in total, cherry profile, 1.4mm PBT.  For the price, they keycaps don't seem half bad and there's a few legend imperfections but not as bad as I was expecting and some spacebar warping but not unexpected for pbt.  The feel of the pbt is pretty good as well, smooth.

Mill-maxed with 0305 for a Tsangan hot-swap layout. See attached album for supported layout.

Supports 5-pin switches with no soldering. I removed the stock case screws and added the black ones to give it more of a blackout look.

Two silver rotary encoder knobs included.

I'll include a short black TRRS cable. The board is USB-C but I won't be including a USB-C cable.

Plug in switches, put on keycaps and you have a compelling board without any soldering. Pictured in album with Boba U4 switches and GMK Honeywell set. Switches and keycaps not included.

Just reflashed it with the default QMK firmware.

I am selling my HHKB Blank Black Classic. It has been lubed and silenced with KBD Fans Silencing rings. It will come with the original box as well. It has barely been used and it has maybe 1 hour of use with the silencing rings on it. ~~$165 + shipping~~ **SOLD**

I am selling my SM keyboards TKL. It is transparent purple and teal with a copper plate. It has a Hineybush 87a PCB and is finished off with Kailh Box Blacks. It has GMK stabilizers, but keep in mind the spacebar stabilizer should probably be replaced. It works fine but it a bit sluggish and quite noisy currently. the tabs holding the bar in place broke so I had to replace them with a dab of hot glue as pictured. A new stabilizer would fix this issue. In addition I am including a set of Hyperfuse origins with all the extra caps as well. If you have any questions feel free to ask. I am negotiable on the price. **$450 + shipping**.

I am selling my White POM Iris Rev 4. It was built and used for less than 10 hours, and was just disassembled using a HAKKO FR301. The layout just isn't for me. The only ""defects"" worth noting is that I did need to make some cuts on the bottom plate to make the pcb fit properly (See pics for details) but keep in mind it comes with two brand new plates if you would prefer to make the cuts yourself, it also has some scratches on the top plate from removing the switches, but they aren't anything major. It comes with a bunch of extra parts as pictured (You could almost build another case with all the extra layers) as well as the stabilizers on the pcb. ~~$120 + Shipping or Trades~~ SOLD

[Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/uD3tF3p)

Hello, r/mechmarket,

I hope you all healthy and safe at this moment. here are some boards I would like to trades for the other board

**Updates: Got some offers. Needed cash at this moment. The Unbuilt Chimera65 now has the option for $1900 shipped although I am still looking for trades. Will reply by the end of this week**

**What I want is to trade up!!!,** which means I can either add Paypal on my ends or combine what I have in my hands to trade what I want. All boards come with the orginal packages.

Not FCFS. Chats will be ignored.

Comment below, then PM please:)

**Mainly looking for (A-stock or Flawless):**

~~-~~ **~~Keycult No.2 SS/RED~~**

\- ~~TGR Jane V2 CE (Multicolor weight highly preferred. There was a Raw alu version sold here, really want it. but do not think I could get the chance again. But if there is another one like that, would pay anything for it~~\*\*~~)~~\*\* **If there is Raw Alu one, still want to buy.**

**-** **~~AEK Lunar by Ai03~~**

~~-~~ **~~Mode 80 Founder Edition/First Edition~~** **(Purchased)**

&#x200B;

**Willing to fit the amount the seller wants for these three boards.**

**In terms of other boards, I prefer trade by using what I have**

Other raw alu/SS high-end keyboards are also welcome. However, I prefer **65%** in this case. Welcome to send me PM if you have something interesting beside what I put here.

I am on a deadline, so I may reply a littble bit slower. Also, as I mentioned, I can either combine or add Paypal on my end to make up the price difference.

**~~Black Vega~~** ~~- bought from here. It is in perfect condition as far as I can see. The PC plate has some scatches according to the last owner from pulling the swatches. The stabs are lubed clear Zeal stabs.~~

~~If you somehow want to buy it outright, the price I offer here is~~ **~~$650 +shipping~~**~~. Kind of higher than usual since I prefer trade~~ **(SOLD FOR ASKING)**

**~~Keycult No.1/65 Black/Brass~~** ~~- Originally A-stock, however, as you can see in the timestamp, there are some weired speckles on the brass weight and there is a small dot-small anolization come off. The keycaps are not included. Not sure if I will re-anodize it, but decided to put it here.~~

~~It comes with~~

* ~~1 pcb build with v1 Invyr Stems in Cherry Housing on a a Brass plate (the backspace is missing the stab because the original owner used a split backspace and I changed it. I did not get a chance to unsolder it and add that stab0~~
* ~~1 pcb build with lubed and filmed Tangerines 67g on a Brass plate. The stems are swapped to the ones used on OA switches.~~
* ~~One extra brass plate and one red alu plate~~
* ~~If I am using this board to trade a Keycult No.2 SS/RED or TGR Jane V2, I have a hotswap pcb that I bought from a Keycult No.2/65 owner (it works perfectly on No.1/65) to add on for trading~~

**Unbuilt Chimera65 Black/Burgundy -** comes with two PCBs, CF, FR4, Brass Plate, flawless of couse becasue it is brand new. come with original package as the timestamp shows. **$1900 shipped (may reply late due to my approaching deadline)**

&#x200B;

**PS**: also interested in buying (**Bundle preferred)**

\- **~~GMK Dualshot~~** **(Purchased)**

\- **~~GMK Striker~~** **(Purchased, still looking for RAMA artisan for GMK Striker)**

\- **~~GMK Botanical~~** **(Purchased)**

|For Sale:|Description|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|
|WKL KBD8X|Black Alu top/PC Bottom; L&F Lavender switches; Durock V2 stabilizers (lubed); Black POM plate with foam; EXTRAS: Original Brass plate, gummy worm O-ring for gasket mount, and StupidFish Case foam. Excellent condition.|$490 Shipped|
|ePBT Gray blanks|Bought of r/mechmarket for $30 shipped. No longer needed. Bought unused and never used them myself. Ships in bags|$25 Shipped|
|Akko Neon \*Faser\* Keycaps|These can actually be purchased on Amazon from Epomaker. Bought to have while I waited for Laser R2 to ship. Retails for $60. I have used it minimally (less than a week). Comes in a very nice hard shell case and supports a few different layouts.|$50 Shipped|

**Pricing:** The pricing of the KBD8X is subject to negotiation. Bare in mind that I bought the board itself for $380 and then purchased the POM plate, foam, stabs, and switches. Overall my $$$ put into it is around $550. I make an effort to be reasonable and accept offers (not bids) on things I sell, just don't be cheap, be realistic. I'm not in this hobby to make money. I enjoy making and trying keyboards and then I trade or sell them.

**Combinations:** Any cap set combined with the 8X can be added on for -$20 of the keycap cost. I.E. KBD8X + Faser = $520

**Trades:** As mentioned before, I enjoy trying things in this hobby. Any boards that you would like to offer as collateral/trade should be unbuilt. You can make offers of built boards but I am less likely to make the trade is all. I prefer to build my own board as I know many do. I pretty much prefer 60% - 75%. Highly interested in the IFK Katakana + Icon Mods from TKC. GMK sets can be offered as collateral as well.

**Shipping:** Shipping is included in the set prices. If we are negotiating pricing on an item, shipping is an item for debate. Included shipping is for CONUS only however I may be willing to split shipping costs for interested Maple enthusiasts (Canada).

**Aanzee - £500(~$680) £650(~$890) with GMK DMG + shipping.**


Board has been desoldered so will come as a kit. Selling it as I like to swap keycaps on boards but due to the colour of the board(which is lovely) it's hard to find matching sets hence the bundle with DMG. The board has been used but doesn't have any damage besides Patina marks which you can see in the pictures. The plate is a little dirty so could do with a clean but tbh you don't see it under the caps anyway. 

Will ship the board in the box it came in which is really cool, it's massive though so I could send it in a smaller box if you're not that interested in it and want cheaper shipping.

I *could* be tempted by trades (even though im trying to make space), looking for pc boards or interesting TKLs.

~~**GMK DMG base + spacebars £220($300) + shipping**~~ **SOLD**

Don't really want to sell the set on it's own, would rather bundle. I won't part out the spacebar kit unless you want to pay silly money. Set has been used so it's not brand new but the caps aren't what i'd call shiny. Comes with base and spacebar kit. Will ship in trays or bags, whatever you want.

**JIS Realforce - £120(~$160) shipped uk**

Love topre but just don't really use this so making some space, it's variable domes. Apparetnly some of the caps are from a HHKB, see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/je1l67/euuk_h_jis_realforcegingham_kithfo_gothcap_blanks/g9btvo5/) comment on a past sale thread.","[EU-UK] [H] Aanzee, GMK DMG, Realforce Jis [W] Paypal"

1. Drop Shift barebones kit. Comes with original box and all accessories(cable, keycap puller, switch puller, feet). Swapped stabs with ZealPC Genuine Cherry stabs and band-aid modded. No rattles on stabs now. Used for less than 5 hours. Want to let go because the board is still a little too big for my tiny workdesk. And I've acquired a lot of other boards lately so need some funds. Originally bought to try out 1800 layout. Board itself is flawless. Price is $190 shipped within CONUS. Warning: Barebones means it does ***NOT*** comes with switches or keycaps.
2. Drop + RedSuns GMK Red Samurai Keycap Set 1800 Kit. Used for maybe 1 hour cuz it arrived much later than the Drop Shift and I have no other 1800 board. Basically new, no shine. Price is $110 shipped within CONUS.
