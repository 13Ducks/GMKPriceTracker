Evenin' MM. Here's what I have.

(SOLD) **Fox Lab Key65 (PC)** \- Polycarbonate top, middle, and bottom. No top-right blocker layout w/ a Pink aluminum weight with black logo. (3) plates: Pink aluminum, Pink brass, and Polycarbonate. (2) PCBs: Hotswap 7u (comes with c3 stabs lubed with 205g0) and a soldered universal (brand new). Also comes w/ 2 sets of plate foam. I bought it from another user here on mm. I built it with the hotsawp PCB and tried out the 3 different plates. All are still in excellent condition. The board is great and sounds great. I got it because I've been wanting to a clear PC case. Unfortunately it just isn't for me.  Comes in original Fox Lab packaging and box. (Does not come w/ switches or keycaps.) Looking to break even as close as I can on it.

**Asking what I paid for it - $600 shipped - SOLD**

**(SOLD) Tofu60 (silver)** \- Board is in perfect condition. Tried 2 different switches in it and then put it up. Comes w/ a DZ60RGB V2 (arrow layout) hotswap pcb, GMK screw in stabs clipped and lubed w/ 205g0 on top of Upgrade Keyboard stab pads, aluminum plate, plate foam, and case foam. Comes in original box.(no switches or keycaps)

**Asking $150 +shipping - SOLD for asking**

**(SOLD) GMMK TKL (White Ice color)** \- My first custom keyboard. Lightly used because I quickly moved onto something else. Originally came w/ Gat Brown switches (still have them and can install them if you prefer those instead). I replaced them w/ Kalih Speed Silver switches (board will come with these unless you choose the Gat Browns). Also comes w/ white shine-through keycaps and stabs that have been clipped and lubed w/ 205g0. Comes in original box. (Note: Didn't notice until I took the pic, it will come with a white spacebar, not the black one in the pic.)

**Asking $90 +shipping - SOLD for asking**

Heyo, looking to sell off some Discipad kits. I'm looking for Paypal G&S or trades (see below).

This is a DIY Kit, requiring soldering of through hole components as well as switches. Build guide available [here](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5c533d33348cd92b886e544d/t/5d90e24fbd027f6ecf7cfb2a/1569776210721/DISCIPAD+BUILD+GUIDE.pdf), courtesy of the designer CFTKB. I've got a total of 8 kits available, they're all mostly the same with the exception of included stabilizers. These kits are priced a bit higher due to the included add-ons (Durock v2's, foam, fr4 plate) and the pcb/back plate/mounting plate color which increased manufacturing costs on JLC.

All MCU's have been flashed with a bootloader and preloaded with VIA compatibility. Components are labeled. Flux is highly recommended for the USB C port. All kits include PCB, backplate, blue foam from u/stupidfish1 and an FR4 plate that I designed and tested.

***Trades:***I'm looking for \*GMK Firefly, GMK DMG R2, GMK Olive, a white HHKB Pro 2 board, and a white FC660C.

I can make up a difference with Paypal, but I'm hoping to knock some of the price off with these kits. I'd also be interested in some obscure switches/interesting trades. If you think you have something cool, I'd be down to chat about it."

I have some boards that doesn’t get much love so I’ll be selling them. 

1. Blue BM43A

Still BNIB, never used. Originally bought it to have a small keyboard for travel but that obviously never happened. So I’m just asking for how much I paid for it, being $100 Shipped

SOLD FOR $90 SHIPPED

2. P3D Acrylic Prime_E

Built with Silk Yellow and IFK Pbt set and GMK Stabs.

Great little board just not for me, tried to make it work but just never got used to the lack of numbers row. I’m asking for $140 shipped OBO

3. Pink/E-White E8.5

Hotswap PCB, Built with Frankenswitch of what’s left from making creampaca + Durock and C3 stabs. There’s no gummyworm gasket.

Disclaimer it has a small ding next to F13 it’s only a minor cosmetic flaw so it has no performance issue whatsoever.

Bought it from another user to give WKL a try. Cool board but I don’t really like the WKL layout as much as I thought I would so I’m asking for exactly how much I paid for it being $500 shipped OBO

SOLD FOR $435 SHIPPED

If you think the prices are not fair please let me know and I’ll adjust accordingly, if not thank you for stopping by."

Hello lovely people of Mechmarket!

Unfortunately during circumstances i have to slim down on my collection. It took me a long time to collect some of the boards down below. All are put together by me by buying each part individually.I know i can make more money by splitting the keycaps, cases, mods etc.. But since these boards were holy grails for me, they might be a holy grail for someone else too. If i had the chance back then, it would save me a lot of money. So u know what, i'll  accept the loss to make someone happy :)

Continuing to lighten my collection and am selling things that I no longer plan to use.

This sale is **not** FCFS, I will be prioritising bundles, trades, local deals, people I have traded with before, verified paypals, and people who have trade history. Due to the ongoing pandemic, sales are **CONUS only.** Will consider Canadian buyers but you will have to pay additional shipping.

As I am selling everything for either what I paid for or less, prices are firm at this time. Some of these items are still in stock at the vendors I bought them from - my prices include what I had originally paid for shipping.

Please comment before pming! No chat.

This is ANSI with Cherry MX Greens and original keycaps as well as the extras you see. There is no USB cable because i've no clue where it is.

There are some scratches on the back of the case where i removed the plate as i was going to transfer it all over to an alu case but i realised 60%s are not the size for me. Scratches and watnot can be seen in the album.

**ISO WASD V2 with Cherry MX Clears**

https://imgur.com/1dUqltW.jpg

This is a modified WASD V2 who's MX Browns were replaced with MX Clears by Margo Baggins a long long time ago.

I used this for about a year non-stop at work so it got a decent amount of use. However, I did just plug it in and can't seem to get anything going on it, and there are some small bits of corrosion on the plate that I have taken pictures of near the number 4, numpad 0 and left arrow switches.

I'm selling this for parts essentially so i'm asking for $40

Just a few small dings in the side that are visible in the picture. One issue to note is that one of the RGB LEDs is stuck on green. Not a big deal for me since I don't use them, but might be important to some.

Comes with hotswap PCB, FR4 Plate, Brass Plate, and 5 lubed smokey durock v2 stabs. There's an issue with the brass weight screwholes where 3 of them were broken in transit from KBDfans.

Selling the TKL Kit for $70 and the matching cable, from SpaceCables for $55, and $10 for shipping. Adding in the Paypal Goods & Services fees, the total cost is $139.22. - Price is negotiable.

Keycaps show slight signs of wear on the WASD and LShift key. The cable is hardly used and looks great - USB C (device side) to USB A (host side)

Edit: I didn't realize I'm missing 3 keys from the original TKL set, I truly believe Drop didn't ship them, but oh well. The 'Insert' and 'End' are two out of the three. I really don't know which the third is, please refer to pictures to try to ID. Due to this I'm lowering the price of the caps themselves, which is reflected above."

Keycaps are from a Cherry G81-3000HAD limited Fan Edition Board.

Bottom Row keycaps ( Ctrl, Alt, Win etc.) are pad printed though with off-centered stems, so they wont fit many boards i guess.

Keycaps will be shipped in a bag.

[Pics with timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/Tg4q8q2)

This board has been collecting dust in the closet for the last year.

Some  notes about the board:

\-Zealios V2 62g lubed with Tribosys 3204  
\-GMK  screw-in stabilizers-  
\-Comes with spare daughterboard and PCB-RGB

The RGB does not function anymore which was a common problem with the GB. The RGB on the spare PCB worked when tested. Cannot guarantee it will continue to keep on working as RGB LEDs started failing after installing the PCB.  
If you do not care about RGB however, the Doro is an excellent board.

Good Morning /r/mechmarket 

Looking to Trade my beloved M65-A for something else, unique, show me what you got!!

**The Info:**

* M65-A Solarized Dark Edition
* Aluminum Bottom 
* Brass Plate and Brass Weight
* Built with Lubed and Filmed V2 Tealios
* Additional Tada68 PCB Included
* Lubed Purple Durock Stabilizers with Gold Wires
* GMK Solarized Dark Base Kit and Color Modifiers

**The Facts**

* Case is in great condition except for 1 spot in the top left corner where some of the anodization was scratched off when it was unintentionally scratched against another board.  (The other board won...)  It's not a dent, it's not a chip, it's literally a scratch in the anno, that's it.  
* PCB has 2 dead keys.  The Up Arrow and ""Pg Dn"" don't work.  The PCB came this way with the kit and even when trying to jump it, or find some work around it hasn't fixed the issue.  As such there is an additional Tada68 PCB that comes with this and is a direct fit for the board.  (If you want I can talk about desoldering it for you with my vacuum gun if you're interested)
* The board has been my wife's daily for a full year.  As such the keycaps are heavily shined on the alphas and 7U space bar.  The set was already shined a bit when I bought it, but now it's really shiny.  But this is typical with any GMK set.
* The Color mods are missing just a couple of keys.  It's not the full set, but it fits the M65-A layout fine.  
* There are no scratches or issues with the brass weight and it's flawless.  
* I'm looking to trade rather than sell.  **However if I had to sell I'd be asking $800 O.B.O.**  PLEASE DON'T GIVE ME ANY SHIT FOR MY PRICE.  I LITERALLY WOULD RATHER TRADE SOMEONE THAN SELL THIS.  IF YOU WANT IT BADLY ENOUGH THERE IS MY ASKING PRICE!

**WANTS**

I'm open to almost anything.  As you can see in a few pictures, I already have a really nice 65% that I use for gaming/evening use so I'm most likely not interested in another 65% unless it's something really cool.  Looking for anything unique like a TMO (prefer V1), Cajal, or other 45% board, or if you want to talk about taking a GB spot I'd be open for that too.  Anything 60% and below is probably my sweet spot but again, I'm open and you might surprise me.  If you have a Pearl 40% or open spot in the Adelie GB let's talk seriously!

I'm open for 1:1 or 1+PP:1 or 1:1+PP.

Please Comment Before PM and then we can chat.

Thanks and have a great rest of your weekend!

I want to sell my GMK Bleached base set and my macropad. The bleached set is opened and has been mounted, I just opened the box took pictures and put them back in. I like the set but really doesn't match any of my boards. The macropad is a Sun20pro macropad from Velocifire and is in the pulse colorway. It looks good and the RGB is amazing but I have no use for it.

Local to Austin, TX

Hey all! Looking sell or trade some boards and sell some switches. Bundles would be cool. These are two of the first boards I got last fall when I first got into this hobby. My tastes are changing, so I'm hoping to give these to loving homes!

Please look closely at the CA66 pics. There are 3 dings on the board. The Hello M0110 is in near perfect condition. Can send more pics if needed. My discord is nainaigogo#3091. Everything works fine.

Looking for trades that are 65% or 75% (not looking for anything in particular so send me any offers you have). If you feel something is unreasonably priced, let me know and we can work something out.

Hello mechmarket,

Here is a highly customizable stacked acrylic alice case that I designed and had cut. I really liked SMkeyboards work but didn’t want to wait for the commission. I also prefer my smaller footprint and got it to approx. 348mm x 133mm. My design is based off the lubrigante, and took the front angle/profile of the arisu.

Case: is clear matte and I use 1 3mm transparent dark grey for flair. The hardware used is m2 with countersunk screws and washers utilizing an m female to female stand off.

Plate: Is a white pom full plate 1.5mm

The case has been used with a USB C bottom pcb.  To allow for top usb C,  I have extra spacers so all you have to do is change the order of the acrylic.  However top usb C pcbs have not been tested.   
Take note there is only 3.5mm between pcb and plate so measure carefully if you intend to purchase for your usb C top or micro usb pcb. 

stack is 9mm above the plate (high profile), 1.5mm plate, 7.5mm  of spacer below plate and 3mm case bottom. It accepts aluminum case feet both m3 and m4

Here is where it gets cool. I also had cut another matte acrylic piece for the top so you can change to match dark or light keysets. Also, if you get a scratch just put the new one on. Mounting hardware doesn’t need the washers. If you don’t like the look you can also be flush

\*had another color in mind? I’ll give you the case top dxf file and you can print every color of the rainbow. Want a brass or copper plate? Again dxf file is yours.

Sorry no PCB but you can pick up a sneakbox hotswap pcb which are in stock or preorder on project keyboard for some RGB.

Typing sound has that stacked acrylic goodness. Typing feels great I enjoy it just as much as my gasket mount boards. [Quick and Dirty Typing test](https://youtu.be/pAsNg1fi8XU)

Hello! Today I have some deals. I got a little too excited recently and am looking to off-load some things.

**Monokei Kei - $675 shipped OBO**

[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/t6t9Ozm)

Silver with red bottom, HHKB, A - Stock, Polcarb plate, solderable PCB, built. I’m not looking to de-solder. I don't have the instruction card / art for this board.

There is a small scratch on the left blocker, and a very very small mark on the right side of the board, see photos. Both marks are very minor in my opinion, but you can judge for yourself.

Built with Tealios V2, turquoise, 65g. Switches have been lubed with Krytox 205 G0 and filmed with Deskeys switch films. Stabs are Durock V2, color smokey, lubed with Krytox 205 G0, landing pads on the pcb.

Make me an offer!

~~Q: Wait, what the hell? Why is this GMK Minimal set so cheap? Why is it OBO?~~

~~A: Well….~~

~~I purchased this set used, for… well… more than this. It came with some shine. A bit more than I expected but oh well, not a huge deal. I thought, “I can shine these fully so that they’re even and look nicer”. This idea was fine, I was slowly shining them by hand. Then I got impatient. I used a dremel with a soft wheel on it and some plastic shine compound to speed up the process. Unfortunately the friction was hard to control and I ended up deforming a few caps. Theyre not tooooo bad, but some keys, like the 7u spacebar and return keys have marks where the top layer of plastic is a bit deformed and other keys like the O key have corners that are basically worn down. I’ve included photos so you can see for yourself. I know, I know, I fucked up. I also don’t have any idea how to price this set now. Hence the OBO. Don’t get offended if you think my price is way to high for a~~ *~~damaged~~* ~~set like this, just low ball me.~~

Purchased some things that aren’t seeing much use after a move to mostly 40% boards. Comment before PM, I don’t use reddit chat so make sure you send PM. Shipping included to CONUS only. Prioritizing bundles and willing to discount. Happy to negotiate if anything is priced too high, modded switches can be especially hard to value.

**60% hotswap keyboard - $150 shipped**

Case: KeyboardBelle 60% Cassette Futura B-Stock, Beige - only flaw I can see is a small mark on the bottom of the case that isn’t visible when using. Hand-cut foam under PCB that can be removed as needed (it's really tight so doesn't make much difference). Comes with 5-degree 3D-printed wedge to give some angle.

PCB: 1up Keyboards HTE (Hotswap Tsangan Edition) - QMK/VIA compatible, has underglow (which isn’t really visible in the case), hotswap sockets are all in great shape ([store page](https://1upkeyboards.com/shop/controllers/1up-rgb-60-pcb-hte/)). South-facing switch orientation but you'll be fine w/ cherry profile keycaps if you use the included switches as they have longer stems.

Switches: Cherry Silent Red Housing, Kailh Pro Burgundy Stem, Sprit 69g supreme spring (linear), Kebo thin yellow films. Switches lubed w/ Krytox 205g0 on stem and 105 oil on springs. Stock Durock silent linear on spacebar as it’s pretty loud with SA caps but I’ll include another of the Kailh/Cherry switches in case you like the loud space. Switches are pretty thocky and pleasant to type on. [Typing test](https://voca.ro/1fqfZNpShFF3) of the board on a phone mic.

Keycaps: SA Vomit set from Signature Plastics grab bag. A few extras are included here as well if you want different accent enter/esc. Spacebar has hand-cut foam inside, it’s a little scuffed looking but works just fine and I can remove if needed. The Os are scooped homing caps.

Plate: Carbon fiber universal plate - same one as [here](https://3dkeebs.com/collections/everything-else-1/products/carbon-fiber-60-plate?variant=36413205348514) with the 2.25 left shift

Stabs: C3 v2 Dark Grey with steel wire - lubed w/ SuperLube on wire and Tribosys 3204 on sides of stem

Cost breakdown before shipping to me: $35 case/wedge + $45 PCB + $25 plate + \~$25 keycaps + \~$40 switches = $170

Everything is barely used and in great shape but I'm moving to split-space life.

**~~Holy Bobas (pink top)~~** **~~x66 - $95 shipped~~** ~~(will also include 1 Boba U4 Thock and 1 Boba U4 silent in case you want a silent space or need to fill out a 65% board). Lubed using Gazzew method w/ Loob-3g on bottom housing rails, no lube on legs. 68g stock springs donut dipped in blend #3.~~ SOLD FOR ASKING

**U-stem Sky bottom w/ Boba pink top** **x108 - $85 shipped**. UHMWPE stems from 415keys and lubed w/ Tribosys 3204. 65g TX short springs lubed with 105 oil. No need for films with these tight boba tops. Separated/cherry-picked into groups based on how well they held loose-stem Keyreative ABS spacebar. 68 held spacebar tight, 40 had some level of looseness. EnjoyPBT pbt keycaps held well on the vast majority of stems during testing and I would recommend using tighter-stemmed keycaps if you intend to use all 108. Basically par for the course with the u-stems.

Good Morning /r/mechmarket 

Looking to Trade my beloved M65-A for something else, unique, show me what you got!!

**The Info:**

* M65-A Solarized Dark Edition
* Aluminum Bottom 
* Brass Plate and Brass Weight
* Built with Lubed and Filmed V2 Tealios
* Additional Tada68 PCB Included
* Lubed Purple Durock Stabilizers with Gold Wires
* GMK Solarized Dark Base Kit and Color Modifiers

**The Facts**

* Case is in great condition except for 1 spot in the top left corner where some of the anodization was scratched off when it was unintentionally scratched against another board.  (The other board won...)  It's not a dent, it's not a chip, it's literally a scratch in the anno, that's it.  
* PCB has 2 dead keys.  The Up Arrow and ""Pg Dn"" don't work.  The PCB came this way with the kit and even when trying to jump it, or find some work around it hasn't fixed the issue.  As such there is an additional Tada68 PCB that comes with this and is a direct fit for the board.  (If you want I can talk about desoldering it for you with my vacuum gun if you're interested)
* The board has been my wife's daily for a full year.  As such the keycaps are heavily shined on the alphas and 7U space bar.  The set was already shined a bit when I bought it, but now it's really shiny.  But this is typical with any GMK set.
* The Color mods are missing just a couple of keys.  It's not the full set, but it fits the M65-A layout fine.  
* There are no scratches or issues with the brass weight and it's flawless.  
* I'm looking to trade rather than sell.  **However if I had to sell I'd be asking $850 O.B.O.**  PLEASE DON'T GIVE ME ANY SHIT FOR MY PRICE.  I LITERALLY WOULD RATHER TRADE SOMEONE THAN SELL THIS.  IF YOU WANT IT BADLY ENOUGH THERE IS MY ASKING PRICE!

**WANTS**

I'm open to almost anything.  As you can see in a few pictures, I already have a really nice 65% that I use for gaming/evening use so I'm most likely not interested in another 65% unless it's something really cool.  Looking for anything unique like a TMO (prefer V1), Cajal, or other 45% board, or if you want to talk about taking a GB spot I'd be open for that too.  Anything 60% and below is probably my sweet spot but again, I'm open and you might surprise me.  If you have a Pearl 40% let's talk seriously!

I'm open for 1:1 or 1+PP:1 or 1:1+PP.

Please Comment Before PM and then we can chat.

Thanks and have a great rest of your weekend!

Hello, I am looking into picking up what I considered to be my ""endgame"" keyboard when I first got into this hobby and am looking to trade some of the stuff listed here for it or just buy it with paypal. I am looking for **only** a Black Polycarbonate Think 6.5 v1 preferably with the badge but I am not against a badge-less one. Preferably unbuilt or Hotswap. 

Here is what I have to sell/trade:

* MGA Standard Black - Built with stock 68g Boba U4T's on an Aluminum Plate with a red Project Keyboard Alice PCB. Has Cherry Clip-ins with Cannonkeys wires Lubed with 205g0 on housing and Permatex on wires. - **Looking to get $275 USD Shipped**

* Sneakbox Hotswap Alice PCB, Aluminum Alice Plate, and Rotary Encoder with Black Knob - These are from his recent sale. I am looking to get back what I have into it. - ~~Looking to get $105 USD Shipped~~ **SOLD**

* Switch Couture X Mechlovin Alice PCB - This is a Top side USB-C PCB so it does not work with all Alices. - ~~Looking to get $60 USD Shipped~~ **SOLD**

* GMK Skidata+ Base Kit - ~~Looking to get $230 USD Shipped~~ **Decided not to sell**

* GMK ASCII Base Kit + Spacebars Kit (Has some shine, the gray hides it fairly well but these are not unused.)  - ~~Looking to get $250 USD Shipped~~ **SOLD**


I am not interested in any trades other than for an unbuilt Think 6.5 V1 in Black Polycarbonate. I'd prefer to just buy the board through paypal and recoup my money through selling the other stuff though.

~~**GMK Botanical Base:** Sealed. **Looking for $325 shipped**~~ **SOLD**

~~**SKCM Salmon Alps:** 62 salmon alps + 1 SKCM lock switch.  These...are not in the best condition. Had to give them the full restoration treatment: Ultrasonic cleaning the top housing and sliders, and then dry lubing them the top housing and sliders, as well as paper-modding them. They feel OK in the end. Tested switches are on multimeter where 43 are in working condition while 19 others are not. I'm sure you could get the 19 others to work by bending the leaf spring on the switchplate back. Condition based on key feel alone ranges wildly from 4.5-6/10. Could haggle a bit lower pricing if you feel like it. **Looking for $35 shipped**~~ **SOLD**

**Apple Portable Alps Keycaps:** [Full layout](https://i.imgur.com/ZMHnII9.jpg) You'll find that these looking strikingly like those from the alpha portion of a M0116, meaning that the right hand mods are all 0.5U shorter than traditional 60% layouts (1.5U backspace, 1.75 enter, 2.25 shift). Cleaned through an ultrasonic.

&nbsp;

Selling switches I'm never going to use. **All prices include Paypal fees and estimated shipping of ~$9 to get back almost exactly what I spent on the switches** (outside of the lubed/filmed switches that have a small upcharge for my time). Because all prices already include shipping, I will make sure to adjust the price down the more sets of switches you buy accordingly depending on what the final shipping estimate will be. I will also lube the stock switches (besides the vint blacks) for an extra $0.40 per switch if really desired.

Selling only to CONUS (I've sold to Canada before and found international is a pain, sorry) and only taking offers if physically stated. Trades also have priority.

Thanks for looking and let me know if you're interested!

Proof \^

NOTE: This does \*NOT\* include the numpad set, just the keys listed. I've checked my invoice and I'm unsure why I don't have the numpad set, but I don't, and they are definitely \*not\* included. I've dropped the price to £150 to accommodate. Thanks to /u/hectoring and /u/s-elnimr for pming.

No Original Box. Live in a tiny flat =\\.

~~£200,~~ £150 for the full set (sans numpad), which is about what I paid for them all up (shipping & tax). Not interested in splitting the sets at all. Just checked the invoice, I paid $230 USD all up.

Would rather not post outside of the EU, but can do if needed.

Downsizing my collection. Brand new or used, I'm the first and only owner. Condition is clearly stated with close-up photos in timestamp to show condition. All items come with **original and full packaging just like when newly shipped,** unless otherwise stated.

Payment: All through Paypal Goods and Services for your peace of mind as it comes with buyer's protection, unless you specifically request other methods otherwise.

I ship globally to your residential country or to your Singapore forwarder address (I'm based in Singapore), shipping estimate:

1. Shipping to your Singapore forwarder address, less than 7 USD;
2. Shipping to your residential country:

a. Standard shipping (selective countries only) - **7-15 USD** for smaller items, **12-35 USD** for bigger items.

b. Express shipping - **25 USD onwards**; keyboard will be usually 50 **USD onwards (shiping within Asia will be cheaper)**. For goods value above 300 USD, I will only recommend to ship with Express option given faster turnaround and better point-to-point tracking. Combine multiple purchases to save on shipping as there's always a base weight charged.

[SOLD] 3 Packs of Glorious Pandas (108 switches total) 

The switches have not been used and are brand new. I only opened one pack to look at them but did not open up the bag inside. Bought directly from Glorious. I originally bought them to put in a GMMK Pro but went with linears instead.

Price: $70

What’s inside/on it
Brass 60% plate
GMK screw in stabs
Instant60 PCB
INK Blacks (just enough to cover the board, lubed and filmed disclaimer: this was my first time lubing/filming so not a professional)
ePBT Miami Nights Doubleshot ABS

Price: will be dependent on what you want from the build. I’ll let the Tofu60 case with the stabs and PCB go for $140


This Tofu is my first build so it is by no means a professional build. I’m building a GMMK PRO and wanted to get rid of this one. I’m willing to sell select parts of the build if necessary.

I would prefer a domestic sale."

Good Evening/Morning /r/mechmarket 

Looking to Trade my beloved M65-A for something different.

**The Info:**

* M65-A Solarized Dark Edition
* Aluminum Bottom 
* Brass Plate and Brass Weight
* Built with Lubed and Filmed V2 Tealios
* Additional Tada68 PCB Included
* Lubed Purple Durock Stabilizers with Gold Wires
* GMK Solarized Dark Base Kit and Color Modifiers

**The Facts**

* Case is in great condition except for 1 spot in the top left corner where some of the anodization was scratched off when it was unintentionally scratched against another board.  (The other board won...)  It's not a dent, it's not a chip, it's literally a scratch in the anno, that's it.  
* PCB has 2 dead keys.  The Up Arrow and ""Pg Dn"" don't work.  The PCB came this way with the kit and even when trying to jump it, or find some work around it hasn't fixed the issue.  As such there is an additional Tada68 PCB that comes with this and is a direct fit for the board.  (If you want I can talk about desoldering it for you with my vacuum gun if you're interested)
* The board has been my wife's daily for a full year.  As such the keycaps are heavily shined on the alphas and 7U space bar.  The set was already shined a bit when I bought it, but now it's really shiny.  But this is typical with any GMK set.
* The Color mods are missing just a couple of keys.  It's not the full set, but it fits the M65-A layout fine.  
* There are no scratches or issues with the brass weight and it's flawless.  
* I'm looking to trade rather than sell.  **However if I had to sell I'd be asking $900.**  PLEASE DON'T GIVE ME ANY SHIT FOR MY PRICE.  I LITERALLY WOULD RATHER TRADE SOMEONE THAN SELL THIS.  IF YOU WANT IT BADLY ENOUGH THERE IS MY ASKING PRICE!

**WANTS**

I'm open to almost anything.  As you can see in a few pictures, I already have a really nice 65% that I use for gaming/evening use so I'm most likely not interested in another 65% unless it's something really cool.  Looking for anything unique or if you want to talk about taking a GB spot I'd be open for that too.  Anything 60% and below is probably my sweet spot but again, I'm open and you might surprise me.  (If you have a Pearl 40% let's talk seriously!)

I'm open for 1:1 or 1+PP:1 or 1:1+PP.

Please Comment Before PM and then we can chat.

Thanks and have a great rest of your weekend!

This set is brand new and still sealed.  It will come shipped in its original package.

**IDOBAO ID80 Hotswap built - 380 + shipping  (OBO)**

This is the grey version of the board and is built with gateron ink blacks v2 that have been lubed with Krytox 205g0 and filmed with black TX films.  I has genuine cherry screw in stabilizers that have been lubed, clipped, and band-aid modded.  This is a hotswap PCB.  It also has Dominikey SA Pink and White keycaps.  Unfortunately I tried mounting the arrow keys on box jades and the keycap stem cracked making them a little more loose than the others.  I can fix this with glue or ship as is.

Feel free to PM with questions!

This keyboard is [gutted](https://i.imgur.com/d2NXNzH.jpg), [shaved](https://i.imgur.com/EROzK5j.jpg), painted, and[ filled with weights](https://i.imgur.com/muKdxcE.jpg).  At **over 2 lbs, It is a staggering 82% heavier than a normal HHKB!**

Flawless condition. Comes with a desoldering PKB PCB, aluminum plate, PC plate, and LEDs/hardware.

Shipped in PCK carry case.~~

~~**HHKB Professional Classic - $190 shipped**
(White/Printed, Manufacturing date July 2020)
Basically new, only used for a few typing tests to compare with my Type-S as this was originally meant to be a donor board for other projects.~~

**MIssing “up arrow”** 
Bone base used for &lt;5 hours, Rolling bones and UMKA are unused. No shine or loss of texture. One of my most prized sets because of the R0 and R5, unfortunately missing the “up arrow” which could be somewhat replaced with the 1u shift key. Shipped in bags.~~

All 4 of the GMK Sumi deskmats, unused. I only have one box that is long enough for these so I’d prefer to sell them in a single bundle.~~

Everything will be shipped in the original box and comes with a (will do it once sold) desoldered H60 PCB, Aluminum Half Plate, and extra new screws that came with the board. The foam that I used for it is not the original foam that it cam with but if you would like it just lmk. There are light scuffs on the inside of the board but unnoticeable once it is built. I can detail if you would like. Really like the way the board sounds

 **GMK Bento R1 - $250 shipped OBO**

The set as you can see has some decent shine on it so its got some good use but otherwise a perfectly suitable set."

Item | Price | Notes
:-- | :-- | :--
PC HHKB Leaf60 | ~~$350 local, $375 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Built with Gat Black Inks, PC plate, Zeal stabs, and black back weight. I bought this one off [this nice person](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/kk0l7j/kr_h_leaf60_hhkb_rama_heavy_industry_seq2_w_paypal/) from Korea and it is beautiful but I've moved onto something different. I was forgot to take photos myself but if you check their timestamps, you can find a crack on the inside of the top housing, which isn't noticeable when built/in use. Will come in box with extra top housing. Pictured in **new timestamp** with the PBT WoB keycaps, not included in price but will include for $50.
HHKB Classic Charcoal | ~~$200 local, $220 shipped~~ **pending** | Bought from someone here. Sliders are very lightly lubed with 3204 but could probably do with a more thorough brush over. Will come in original box, original black spacebar, blue & red PBT spacebars, and RAMA cable as I don't have the original.
[GMK Laser R1](https://imgur.com/rNeCyzp) | ~~$375 local, $400 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Base, gaijin, spacebar, and blocknet kits. These were my daily driver for a little under a month so they have been used but there is little to no shine, not that I could find at least. Price is for base kit shipped in GMK tray and the rest in bags.
GMK Peach Blossom | ~~$220 local, $230 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Bought this set sealed from someone local, used and mounted for less than an hour. I actually sold this to somebody in an older post but unbeknownst to me, two keycaps were missing but were eventually found but the person ended up just returning the set. Box is banged up on one corner but trays are in still in good condition.
GMK Penumbra | ~~$115 local, $130 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Bought from someone local, in bags, as is. There is some shine on some random keys that I tried my best to capture, again, if you scroll down [this timestamp](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/lll49u/usca_h_kuro_m60a_pc_hhkb_leaf60_ewhite_hhkb/).
[Alcatel MMK Doubleshots](https://imgur.com/NIfimo1) | ~~$50 local, $60 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Forgot who I bought these from but these are doubleshot keycaps from an [Alcatel MMK](https://deskthority.net/wiki/images/thumb/a/a0/Alcatel_004.jpg/640px-Alcatel_004.jpg) -- what you see is what you get. Bought these to use for a display board but would prefer they just go to a good home. Shipped in bag.
Laser aviator cable | $40 local, $50 shipped | **The one with the blue heatshrinks.** Bought to go with ePBT Sushi and I thought it went really well together since it has blue connectors and is a lighter shade than other Laser-themed cables.
Laser YC-8 cable | $50 local, $60 shipped | **The one with the purple heatshrinks.** Bought from u/ThePrinkus, one of the nicer cables I've had the pleasure of trying. I paired this with the Laser R1 set and this shade works really well but just going another direction.

Gat Black Inks 68x | ~~$41 local, $51 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Stock.

Penguins x70 | $60 local, $70 shipped | 62g , comes with the extra 67g springs. 205g0 on housing and rails but not the legs, GPL 105 on springs, white Deskey films. Will come in Kinetic Labs bag.
MX Hyperglides x70 | $60 local, $70 shipped | Lubed and filmed by previous owner, not sure with what though.
Zeal Zilents x47 | $40 local, $50 shipped | 67g, *think* these are stock.
118 Ergo Clears and extra parts | $80 local, $100 shipped | This consists of the bags to the left and bottom of Peach Blossom in the most recent timestamp. It contains a bag with 118 Ergo Clears, clear top Panda housings, Kiwi stems, MX Clear springs, more springs which I'm unsure of, a bag of 48 stock Kailh Purples, and a bunch of clicky Kailh switches like the Box Pink and Box Jade.
C3 Equalz stabilizers | ~~$15 local, $20 shipped or free if you buy $100 worth of stuff~~ **Sold!** | Bought to potentially use for friends' builds but never ended up getting used."

Hi all, looking to get rid of some items. I am located in the UK so I would prefer to ship within the UK and then the EU.

All prices are **excluding shipping** within the UK only.

Prefer to sell both and priority will be given to buyers who can buy both items.

Thanks!

|GMK ASCII|Comes with the original box and tray, can ship in bags for a cheaper price.|£145|These caps have been shined and buffed for a smooth texture as a personal experiment. Mainly did this because of the inconsistent shine throughout the board so I decided to sand down all the keycaps and polish them. I really like the feel of these and will be doing this to more of my sets but only getting rid of this set due to having too many atm. I didn't shine ALL of the keys, only the alphas, modifiers, ESC and arrow keys. The rest have the original finish.|

Moving soon and need to clear out some stuff. Prices do not include shipping, but are negotiable. Don't hesitate to send offers, I am motivated to sell. 


[Timestamps and Photos](https://imgur.com/a/xftyaHL)


**Square Badge Model M 101** $110

Decent condition. Needs a good clean, has some broken rivets. Works 100%. Includes PS/2 to SDL cable. 

**Grey badge IBM Model M 101** $60

Missing a few caps and missing the spring on the f12 key. Has some broken rivets. No cable. Works fine otherwise. 
 

**Boxed and restored IBM SSK** $350

Has the original box, Screw modded and fully restored. In overall good condition, however has some scratches on the top case detailed in the timestamp album. Back label is missing, and the badge was as well, so it was replaced with a reproduction industrial badge I had lying around. Includes a brand new unicomp AT to SDL cable.


**IBM Model F AT** $400

2 available. Have been fully restored with new foam and the plates repainted. In overall nice condition, however the badges have some damage to them from corrosion, due to previous storage conditions, [here is a photo](https://imgur.com/a/WBQrLk9).


**IBM Model F AT UNRESTORED** $275

3 available. Completely unrestored condition. Dirty, but fully working. Great projects. Plates have corrosion on them, foam needs replaced. but they are solid and complete. Was planning on restoring them like the others but can't find the time. 

**IBM Model F XT UNRESTORED** $125

7 available. Completely unrestored condition. Dirty, but fully working. Great projects. Plates have corrosion on them, foam needs replaced. but they are solid and complete. Was planning on restoring them but can't find the time. 

**Blue alps AT layout board** $250

Really great condition blue alps, probably 9-9.5/10. Thin doubleshots. Case and caps are dirty, I haven't attempted to clean them. Unfortuantely the board uses an unknown protocol and as far as I know cannnot be converted. Would be nice for a handwiring project though. Cable was replaced with one from a zenith z150 as the original had been cut. 

**Akko 65% MX Blue board** $70

Don't know a whole lot about this, not really my area of interest. A friend bought it, ended up not liking the switches, and asked me to sell it for him. Looks to be [This](https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-Cherry-Switch/dp/B08318P9NJ?th=1) board. Basically unused condition. MX blues and front print PBT caps. 


**NMB RT101 Clicky Space Invaders** $40

Missing the 7 key and the stem/spring. bottom housing contacts look to be bent as well, so entire switch should be replaced. perfect project board for someone who has a donor board. Otherwise seems to work fine. 

**NMB RT8256CW+ Clicky Space Invaders** $55

Complete and fully working, but needs a good clean. Black clicky switches. 


**GMK Skiidata** $240

Complete base kit. Perfect condition, used for less than a week. Includes GMK tray.

**All prices are OBO, priority will be given to bundles.** Due to shipping delays, I'll be shipping UPS and CON-US only.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**~~GMK 8008 Base and Accent Kits~~**

***SOLD for asking*** *~~$300 shipped~~*

Includes base kit and accent kit. The caps are lightly used, but there is no shine or signs of use. Will ship in original GMK tray and sleeve.

&#x200B;

**~~Monstargear PC XO v2~~**

SOLD for $350 *~~$375 shipped (no keycaps or switches included)~~*

Limited edition polycarbonate hotswap TKL from Monstargear with brass plate, brass weight, and RGB lighting. This is a really solid and heavy board. The PVD brass weight and plate give it some real bulk, and it sounds great with tactiles and linears. RGB accent lighting on the side as well as under each key. Stock plate mounted stabs were replaced with genuine Cherry stabilizers and Durock purple stems, lubed with 205g0. Connects via USB-C.

&#x200B;

**~~ALF X1.1 WKL Grey~~**

SOLD for $375 *~~$400 shipped (no keycaps or switches included)~~*

This is an incredibly heavy board anodized in a deep gray with brass plate and weight. I’ve installed mill-max sockets to make the PCB hotswappable. The PVD brass weight and plate are tarnished (see photos), but this does not affect the board’s performance in any way. There is an extra plate and weight in a highly reflective, steel-like PVD finish. I’m not 100% sure if it’s brass, but both are in very good condition.

The PCB is QMK-compatible and connects via USB-C. Please note that the LEDs beneath the ALF logo do not seem to work. The previous seller informed me that they should, but I could never figure it out. They may still work, but assume that they do not.

&#x200B;

**~~KBD 8X MKII WKL Rose Gold + PC Plate and Gummy Worm Gasket~~**

SOLD for $375 *~~$400 shipped (no keycaps or switches included)~~*

Aluminum 8X MKII WKL in rose gold. The PCB has been mill-maxed, making it hotswap. It will come with lubed smokey Durock screw-in stabs. The board’s in like-new condition, with no signs of wear on the ano, brass weight, brass plate, etc.

I’ll also include a polycarbonate plate and a gummy worm gasket, both of which (in my opinion) help this board really shine.

&#x200B;

**PBT Olivia Japanese**

*$50 shipped, +$40 with any keyboard*

Bought this set off of Taobao some time ago. Colors are really nice and, despite being a bit thin, the dye sub of the legends and symbols is pretty good. The PBT is thick and sturdy. Only selling this because I use WKL boards, and this set does NOT support Tsangan or WKL bottom rows.

&#x200B;

**PBT Camping**

*$40 shipped, +$25 with any keyboard*

PBT dye-sub version of GMK Camping. Compatible with standard TKL and 60/65% boards. Do not expect GMK-like quality, as the dye sub legends are not quite as crisp. Colors are also brighter than the original."

[Timestamp](https://imgur.com/gallery/LcrvF0N)

Today I'm saying goodbye to a custom Monstargear Alu Xo V2 Build I've used for the past month. Popularized by Wildcat in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7NyAw90e0c), this board really superseded my expectations, sounded way better than I thought. It was custom anodized by a fellow mechmarketer to a hot pink/purple that matches quite well w/ the Cyberpunk Domikey Doubleshot SA Keycaps/custom cerakoted aviator cable.

Features:

\-Custom Anodized hot pink/purple

\-8.6lb Weight, all aluminum build

\-Hotswappable

\-Polished Brass weight/plate

\-Clipped/lubed genuine gmk stabilizers (no rattle, will retune before sending out)

\-Acrylic Side-glow LEDS

\-Sound-dampening case foam

Condition is overall excellent, with some minor scratching around one screw-hole and a scuff on the polished brass weight (see pictures in timestamp). Overall with the weight, polish, and feel, this board will hopefully be the perfect endgame for someone out there. Would prefer to sell as an entire custom kit (board, switches, caps, and cable), but will part.

Hey all,

Just upgraded to a more permanent board so I am selling my KBD67v2 MKII Gray kit. The board comes with:

&#x200B;

Gray case (excellent/like new condition)

Brass plate

Brass weight

Hotswap PCB

MK Ultra case and plate foam

OA (Original Aspiration) stabilizers -- BNIB. Not currently installed on PCB. I will ship the stabs in original GB packaging along with the keyboard. Link:  [https://cannonkeys.com/products/gb-oa-stabilizers-from-wuque-studio](https://cannonkeys.com/products/gb-oa-stabilizers-from-wuque-studio) \-- absolutely beautiful stabs.

Screws/Hardware

Bonus: Unused Spacebar Foams (12$ value  [https://kbdfans.com/products/spacebar-foam?variant=34275185819787](https://kbdfans.com/products/spacebar-foam?variant=34275185819787) )

&#x200B;

Case itself is in near perfect condition. Zero blemishes, scratches or dings that I can see. PCB has some slight discoloration from when I wiped off a little lube from the stabilizers which is no big deal and has no impact on performance. No other issues at all from what I can see or that I experienced. Was a fantastic board for about 6 months of light to medium use and was taken good care of. Currently out of stock on kbdfans with over 900 people on the wait list.

&#x200B;

**Asking price:** $280 all in, including shipping to CON US only. $240 Local cash pick up (93012 zipcode).

&#x200B;

**\*\*\*\* Also looking to buy GMK Umbra in really good condition or BNIB. Willing to pay for it outright, or trade my board + additional paypal on my end for GMK Umbra. Post, then PM, to discuss. \*\*\*\***

|\~\~104-key OG Cherry WoB double shot set - see below for detailed description.\~\~|Very light shine on the alphas. No shine on the other keys. The 6.25u spacebar is brand new (came from GMK Bleached's spacebar kit.). Will be sold in bags.|$75 + shipping|

Local is 02459.

These were made by Cherry, on the same tooling that is now owned by GMK (Cherry sold their double shot tooling to GMK around 2011 or 2012).Includes only the keys shown. This will fit a typical 104-key full-size, TKL, or 60% with standard winkey bottom row, or something like the Ikki68 layout. Only including the non-stepped Caps Lock only. The alphas cluster keys came from a Cherry G80-8200HUAUS-2, and the nav keys, F-keys, and numpad are from a G81-8000HPBUS-2-C. The spacebar is from GMK Bleached's spacebar kit.

Note that the black Windows keys are pad printed. All other keys are double shot.

Also including the dark gray double shot windows keys shown, which were made by JTK - I got those out of a JTK grab bag.

Note that the white on OG Cherry double shot WoB is a bit creamier and more beige than GMK WoB - seems to be pretty close to GMK L9 (see pic), which is the beige used on 9009. This is a bit more beige than the bright WS1 white you see on Drop's GMK WoB."

|104-key OG Cherry WoB double shot set - see below for detailed description.|Very light shine on the alphas. No shine on the other keys. The 6.25u spacebar is brand new (came from GMK Bleached's spacebar kit.). Will be sold in bags.|$75 + shipping|

Local is 02459.

**OG Cherry WoB**

Includes only the keys shown. This will fit a typical 104-key full-size, TKL, or 60% with standard winkey bottom row. Only including the non-stepped Caps Lock only. The alphas cluster keys came from a Cherry G80-8200HUAUS-2, and the nav keys, F-keys, and numpad are from a G81-8000HPBUS-2-C. The spacebar is from GMK Bleached's spacebar kit.

Note that the black Windows keys are pad printed. All other keys are double shot.

Also including the dark gray double shot windows keys shown, which were made by JTK - I got those out of a JTK grab bag.

These were made by Cherry, on the same tooling that is now owned by GMK (Cherry sold their double shot tooling to GMK around 2011 or 2012).

Note that the white on OG Cherry double shot WoB is a bit creamier and more beige than GMK WoB - seems to be pretty close to GMK L9 (see pic), which is the beige used on 9009. This is a bit more beige than the bright WS1 white you see on Drop's GMK WoB."

Some notes on the items:

\- **Zebra Wood 60%** \- Has DZ60RGB PCB. Came built by KBDFans with lubed stabs and factory Zealios. Comes with wrist rest. I'm willing to desolder and take off $50 but priority goes to anyone who wants it with switches.

\- **GMK Botanical RAMA** \- This is the white version. Opened but used very very lightly.

\- **GMK Botanical Space Cable** \- Has definitely seen better days but is not in horrible condition. See photos.

\- **Nullbits Nibble** \- Unbuilt.

\- **Mechlovin Adelais PCB & FR4** \- This is their first iteration with USB-mini top mount. Will only sell these together as they're already priced low.

Hello,

Trying to do some spring cleaning of some things I am just not going to use anymore. Please comment before PM. I am only shipping to CONUS right now (sorry). If you have any questions feel free to ask. I tried to price everything at or below what I have seen these items sell for recently on here but if something seems off please let me know. Items will be marked out once sold. Thanks!!

**~~Rama M65-B Milk~~**~~: Has hotswap PCB. Keyboard has been built once. I typed on it for around 5 minutes and then unbuilt the board. The board is in perfect condition. This will come with everything you would receive from Rama as well as it having the internal weight installed in the board already. Does not include stabs, switches or keycaps. Will ship this in original box as well. ----~~ ***~~Asking $950 shipped OBO~~*** SOLD FOR $900 SHIPPED

**~~GMK White on Black~~**~~: Picked this up from Drop a few months ago but what I planned on using it for is getting a different set. Set is up for pre order on Drop right now but if you don't want to wait to get the set then here is this one. ----~~ ***~~Asking $150 shipped OBO~~*** SOLD FOR ASKING PRICE

**~~GMK Oblivion v2~~**~~: I believe this is the regular base kit as it has the Hello World! enter key but the previous owner was not for sure. This set does have a good amount of shine on the WASD keys plus others that are used for gaming. The rest of the caps have shine but it is not quite as bad. Pricing will reflect this as well. This will be shipped in bags. ----~~ ***~~Asking $220 shipped OBO~~*** SOLD FOR $200 SHIPPED

**~~PBT Islander~~**~~: Bought this base set for the Rama above but as you can see I will not (hopefully) have that board in my possession too much longer. I mounted this set once, typed on it for maybe 5 minutes and then took it off and put it back in the box. Set looks brand new, no shine at all. Will ship this in the original box. ----~~ ***~~Asking $120 shipped OBO~~*** SOLD FOR ASKING"

[Timestamp](https://imgur.com/gallery/gyJVnPC)

Today I'm saying goodbye to a custom Monstargear Alu Xo V2 Build I've used for the past month. Popularized by Wildcat in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7NyAw90e0c), this board really superseded my expectations. It was custom anodized by a fellow mechmarketer to a hot pink/purple that matches quite well w/ the Cyberpunk Domikey Doubleshot SA Keycaps.

Features:

\-Custom Anodized hot pink/purple

\-8.6lb Weight, all aluminum build

\-Hotswappable

\-Polished Brass weight/plate

\-Clipped/lubed genuine gmk stabilizers (no rattle, will retune before sending out)

\-Acrylic Side-glow LEDS

\-Sound-dampening case foam

Condition is overall excellent, with some minor scratching around one screw-hole and a scuff on the polished brass weight (see pictures in timestamp). Overall with the weight, polish, and feel, this board will hopefully be the perfect endgame for someone out there. Would prefer to sell as an entire custom kit (board, switches, caps, and cable), but will part.

The 16mm springs are similar to Sprit slow springs where more force is required at the top. The milky bottom seems to reduce the sounds relative to the mx housing. Interesting linear switch that feels different from other linears due to the springs and milky housing.

**Notes**

The Klippe case, brass plate, white foams and DZ60RGB PCB have been my daily drivers for around two years, although less used in the last year during home office times (which is where my other kbs live).

They are in good condition, there are normal signs of use on the case and the brass plate has the discolourations typical for the material after some time. I'd keep the GMK screw-in stabs in the PCB unless you'd rather have it without; they might need a good cleaning and re-lubing.

The rest is basically brand-new and originally bought for builds that never happened.

**Shipping**

Insured shipping only, within Germany ~5EUR, within the EU ~14EUR. I'm happy to ship anywhere as long as there is an insured shipping option and you're paying the cost. :)

Time to move along some things. Would prefer to ship within Australia but let me know if you're elsewhere and willing to pay for postage. Can also do organise pickup Brisbane Northside. Negotiable on prices mainly if combining, prices **USD** excluding postage. Can provide further pics of needed, most items have plenty of pics online. No quality issues unless mentioned.

Keyboards:

Anne Pro 1 – Gateron Reds. Switches are spray lubed, did it a year ago and they aren’t as smooth as they were then so let me know if you would like me to give it another round of spray. Stabs are lubed and tape in the plate mount. The spacebar could do some more work, other keys sound like a custom built. Previous owner threaded the screw to disassemble it, so if you plan on doing that you’ll need to get some more screws. But with another spray it would be a perfect first or second mech. Comes with standard white doubleshot keycaps all Annes come with $60

~~UT47.2 Built with lubed V1 Zilents (67g I believe). GMK stab clipped and lubed nicely. Nice hotswap 40%. $70~~

Sentraq S65X. Built with lubed 65g V1 Zealios. Case has a little scratch in front of the spacebar (hardly visible) and a couple under it. A few of the switches are built with gateron housings instead of zealio. Stabs lubed clipped and bandaid modded. I’ve put some foam in the case and it gives it a nice sound and makes it heavier – you just can’t see the LEDs through the acrylic sides while it’s in there. Comes with cheap engraved PBT keycaps. Can include that DSA set for another $50 for a full size. $150

Plum 96 - This is a PCB mount board, and I have replaced the standard Cherry black stems with Gateron Green stems and 80g springs for nice heavy clicks. Being PCB mount means the switch spring, stem and top are essentially hotswappable. Comes with the standard keycaps as seen [here](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/images/products/large_1194_MD-5474_20150120144944_cfc5e8576be07937.jpg) . $110


Switches:

Cherry Silent Black x 110. Lubed with a thick lube for smoothness and noise reduction. $60

Keycaps:
SA Danger Zone R2 – Alphas and mods sets, enough for TKL and smaller with standard layouts including 65%, 7u space layouts as you can see [here](https://drop.com/buy/danger-zone-sa-keycap-set) . $240

NPKC PBT blue and white – nice pretty set with legends engraved on the front. $35

~~Blank grey PBT – Nice think PBt, looks great with RGB underneath it. I believe it’s Gateron brand but can’t confirm as I’m the second owner. $20~~

Transparent dark grey ABS keycaps – as seen [here](https://drop.com/buy/abs-clear-keycaps) $15

Random stuff:
KBD 8x mk 2 Brass plate $45

EK Mechlube 2 - great for use on stabs, can also be used on switches as a thicker lube. $5

Faulty Invyr UHMWPE stems from Drop – they’re sending out replacements and I don’t have a use for these. Useable for a budget build I suppose, or for keycap mounting etc. $5"

Selling my Percent Studio Canoe Gen 2 in the Svart (black) colorway. I purchased it in the group buy and have really loved using it so far, but I want to purchase a different size of keyboard and can't justify keeping this one as well, unfortunately. 

Built with NK Creams (Lubed w/ 205g0) and C^3 stabilizers in a matching cream color. Comes with normal gray center accent plate as well as a yellow accent plate (originally bought to match with GMK Lunar but should look good with plenty of other sets). The keycaps in the pictures were just a placeholder while waiting for the GMK sets I ordered and won't be included unless requested.

Had some unexpected bills come up so I may stop the sale if I reach the amount I need to. *(IF I do this, I will edit the post and make it very evident)*

I acknowledge that some prices will be good, and some on the more on the expensive side; this reflects my readiness to sell that particular artisan and how much I have into it.

&#x200B;

**Artisans:**  
*Letter/Number reflect position in artisan box in* [timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/mbMGPoL)  
*See example table below*

All prices include first class shipping if CONUS, international will be *roughly $10 more. CONUS can upgrade to priority for $4 extra, just let me know before I send the invoice please.*

Hi all, looking to get rid of some items. I am located in the UK so I would prefer to ship within the UK and then the EU.

All prices are **including shipping** within the UK only, other regions you will have to cover the extra cost.

Prefer to sell both and priority will be given to buyers who can buy both items.

Thanks!

Mainly did this because of the inconsistent shine throughout the board so I decided to sand down all the keycaps and polish them. I really like the feel of these and will be doing this to more of my sets but only getting rid of this set due to having too many atm. I didn't shine ALL of the keys, only the alphas, modifiers, esc and arrow keys. The rest have the original finish.|

Hello again friends,

Continuing my journey towards keyboard minimalism and, generally, not hoarding stuff. **Local to Los Angeles, 90006.** I'm happy to talk more about stuff in DMs or provide photos of specific things upon request. The usual: comment before PM, no chats because I have them disabled. Have a good rest of your week!

Item | Price | Notes
:-- | :-- | :--
[GMK Laser R1](https://imgur.com/rNeCyzp) | $400 local, $425 shipped | Base, gaijin, spacebar, and blocknet kits. These were my daily driver for a little under a month so they have been used but there is little to no shine, not that I could find at least. I would prefer to keep the JTK keycap trays but if the buyer wants them both, they can have them for an extra $15. *Anyone can buy the trays, they are FCFS.*
GMK Penumbra | $140 local, $150 shipped | Also bought from someone local, in bags, as is. There is some shine on some random keys that I tried my best to capture, again, if you scroll down the larger timestamp. No tray but, if you want the JTK keycap trays shown in the GMK Laser timestamp, you can have them for $15. *Trays are FCFS.*
[Alcatel MMK Doubleshots](https://imgur.com/NIfimo1) | $60 local, $70 shipped | Forgot who I bought these from but these are doubleshot keycaps from an [Alcatel MMK](https://deskthority.net/wiki/images/thumb/a/a0/Alcatel_004.jpg/640px-Alcatel_004.jpg) -- what you see is what you get. Bought these to use for a display board but would prefer they just go to a good home.
enjoyPBT Sushi (White) | ~~$70 local, $80 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Used for about a month but have been in a bag and in this leftover GMK tray I had. **Price is for shipping in bags.** I can ship in the tray for $10. *As with the JTK trays with Laser, you can buy the GMK tray too for the $10.*
Laser aviator cable| $40 local, $50 shipped, *subtract $10 if bought with Laser* | **The one with the blue heatshrinks.** Bought to go with ePBT Sushi and I thought it went really well together since it has blue connectors and is a lighter shade than other Laser-themed cables.
Laser YC-8 cable | $50 local, $60 shipped, *subtract $10 if bought with Laser* | **The one with the purple heatshrinks.** Bought from the same person who also made the white YC-8 cable. I paired this with Laser on the PC Leaf60 and this shade works really well but just going another direction."

More pics of the color: http://imgur.com/a/C42WGp6

Selling my Space65 CV. It's built with silent alpacas, milmaxed PCB, with a carbon fiber plate. This board was cerakoted in a gun candy chameleon color, it changes between blue and purple depending on how the light hits it. The board will come with the purple and black aviator cable as well, the GMK Taro caps that are on the board (only the ones on the board) as well as the arrows that are in the picture.  The side LED shorted out which I guess is a super common issue with this pcb. 

******THE ARROWS ARE NOT LATS*******

There are imperfections in the coating such as small speckles here and there, they are only visible up close. There's also a small nick on the back of the board. I've pictured these as best I could. 

Asking $600 OBO for the full bundle, keeb, switches, keycaps, and cable. Price is shipped conus lower 48. I would like to buy an expensive mountain bike that my wife is not happy about. Help me make her a little less angry. Please comment before you pm. Stay safe friends!"

A quick note for the pricing: for the boards, I'm trying my best to price them at break-even, which means the prices only cover my costs (the board, switches and mods, stabs, shipping fee to me and PayPal fee). For keycap sets, they are priced at market average.

[Kira60](https://imgur.com/a/0NmbOZG)\- Sad to see this one go as it's my favorite boards I've owned. I love the premium weight and the switches are some of the smoothest I've used. It was originally a silver kira60 prototype. I bought it off a user on here who cerakoted it in dark purple. It's built with lubed and filmed feis with pastel switch tops. The PCB is the BIOI G60BLE. It has bluetooth, but I robbed the battery for another project. It has a small nick in the corner that isn't noticeable when it's on the desk, but I included it in the pictures.  **300 Shipped OBO.**

**Due to the epidemic, the only shipping method from Japan to the United States is shipping.  
It will take about 2 months but cheaper shipping cost.**  
  
**GMK will send from Taiwan so shipping won't be an issue. $15 in bag and $30 in original tray.**  


Thanks for reading."

Items| Price/Quantity | Description

**Keyboard with switches and cable (not hot swap)**|**~~$140 Shipped~~ SOLD**| Green 60% Tofu uses DZ60 PCB, has box black switches and 4 random switches on the arrow keys, Cherry stabs, aluminum plate, and RGB underlighting. Custom USB cable is from zap-cables. 
**PBT Retrocast Keycaps**|**~~$70 Shipped in Plastic Bag~~ SOLD**| Bought these on Aliexpress last month and they just got here a few days ago. I bought these for $77 to try them out and see how aliexpress keycaps were and I gotta say they're pretty good if you want a cheap set of gmk sets. I ended up going for a set of SA keycaps for the glorious board instead. These have not been used just mounted for a picture."
