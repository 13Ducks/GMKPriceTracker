Prices in USD. Shipping refers to inside the USA. Might ship Wednesday and Friday this week. I need a sizeable financial incentive to ship outside of the US right now. I’m in Houston, local is cheaper. FCFS-sorta. I'm gonna eat dinner and if people have bundle offers thats probably favored. If my prices are way off-like something Im selling has obv gone unsold at the price I'm listing, cite your sources and send an offer.  
EDIT: if you write on discord I'll see it eventually. write 'pm on discord' and I'll see it sooner. Reddit chat likely to be significantly delayed. 

**Haves:** 

~~[GMK Umbra](https://imgur.com/a/KmTlKHd): Sealed. Was gonna sell, then trade, then all fell through. 240 shipped in the box, 235 if you let me put them in baggies.~~ SOLD

~~[GMK Shark Bait](https://imgur.com/a/KmTlKHd): I’m glad this got made. Sealed~~. ~~Base novs bars for 300.~~ Base only, uh, 240 shipped sealed, 235 shipped in baggies. ~~Have another novelty kit still too.~~ ALL SOLD

~~[MT3 Serika](https://imgur.com/a/479tWGs): mods have been opened and are unused, the spacebars were the template for the MT3 stupidfish1 foams. Also included sealed are latin alphas, extra mods, geometries, novelties, super homing, alt F-row, numpad. See the drop page for the kits [here](https://drop.com/buy/drop-zambumon-mt3-serika-custom-keycap-set). Note: GMK Serika R2 is next month, you can pay about the same and get em in that profile in ~a year. 340 shipped.~~ **SOLD**

~~[GMK Ceresia](https://imgur.com/a/ScQUFLr), WS1 white on P3 red, so same white as GMK Minimal. Red same as Handarbeit, upcoming Red Alert next year. The 2.75u shift has a cracked stem but feels ok with the little belt on it shown. TKL coverage has minimal shine. This was my first MM purchase years ago. 60+ship~~ **SOLD**

~~[DCS WoB, alphas and most mods](https://imgur.com/a/WgksX8x), no bottom row as you can see. I used these with ceresia early on w my first ducky. Spacebar is a ducky and also a 6u.

Hi mechmarket, here is stuff. I am located on the RIT campus and they have been really good about keeping the COVID case count low so I don't think there should be anything to worry about there. I am also willing I guess to do local cash if you need/want to and are in the area.

All prices in USD shipping included. Shipping to CONUS only.

Things I have:

|Item:|Price:|Condition:|
|:-|:-|:-|
|~~GMK Umbra - Base Kit~~|~~$250/Trades~~ **Sold for asking**|~~Purchased from another user BNIB. Used for about 2 weeks before I put it back in the box. No shine on any of the caps yet.~~|
|Dark Purple Tofu|$200|Built with gat ink yellows on a dz60 with a black alu plate. The layout is ansi but 7u bottom row. I cut some eva foam for the battery cutout as well as to cover the base of the inside. The right shift stab came loose once and when I put it back I found that I had left a minor mark on the front right of the case (shown in timestamps).|
|70x Unholy Pandas|$30|Made from Halo Clear and Yok Polar Panda parts. I can lube them for extra if u want me to for some reason. 205 and 3203 on hand with 105 for springs.|
|~~19x C3 Kiwis~~|~~$15~~ **Sold for $20 lubed**|~~Stock, a few extras I don't need. can also lube these if u want me to. Same lubes as above.~~|

Things I want:

The board was 450 shipped to me from China about a year ago, and the switches cost me $100 - so the way it's priced right now is less than what I paid for it.  This is my 4th price reduction down from 600, but I can't really go much lower than this... I do need to sell it though...  I want to make my reasoning for selling at a loss clear though: it's not because I don't think the board is nice - on the contrary, it's a super nice and very unique keyboard (the arrow cluster is really cool I think).  I simply have too many boards coming in over the next few months and I want to both send this to someone who will use it and use the money from this sale to pay down some of the things I've got on the way!

I have an unbuilt Rama Mist Thermal (caps just on for pics) in full with Solderable PCB w/Halt plate & the original “Beam” aka silver plate. This board is absolutely stunning/amazing and it sitting on the desk looks so unique but I am personally still on the hunt for a Chimera65 or a Keycult 1/60 or 1/65 as the leaf spring mount is not my cup of tea when it comes to typing on.

U80 Milk with hot swap PCB. ~~$550USD excluding shipping (price fell of a cliff since everyone is complaining)~~ SOLD for 750 USD excluding shipping 

Used for less than a week as I don't like TKL, much prefer 65%. Come with all original packaging.

All factory marks were there when the board was received, all coverups with the white paint were done by Rama. There is 1 scratch on the top left corner that has been covered by some white paint by Rama. - can only see this in certain lighting conditions, will not see it when typing. 2 more marks on the inside of the case again covered by some white paint by Rama - cannot see these unless u take the case apart.

Hi mm, I am parting with these Oblivion V2 kits. New and unused, still in plastic wrapping. 

No FCFS I'm afraid, priority goes to nordic and EU buyers, because of shipping cost and the uncertainty of everything at this point.

My asking price is 305EUR before shipping for both kits. I prefer to sell as a bundle, but let me know if you are only interested in one of the kits, and maybe we can figure something out.

*Edit:  Disclaimer about the price—Although they are experiencing a delay, the nk65 Entry will be restocked. However, I hope you do understand for Canadians it cost over $42USD to get it shipped to Canada from NovelKeys. That is also why I stated I would prefer to sell to another Canadian to help avoid those charges.*

Hi all,

looking to sell a couple of items to eventually fund myself an HBCP.

&#x200B;

1. \[$265USD / $345CAD\] **GMK Olivia ++ Dark Base kit.** Still sealed. I bought both the light and dark sets and ended up keeping the light base as I have many more dark GMK sets coming in soon. Would trade for sealed GMK Olive. If opened, I would still be interested with a bit of paypal on your end.
2. \[$750USD / $1000CAD\] **Percent Studio Canoe Gen 2 Casio limited edition**. Still sealed in original packaging. This guy took waaaay too long and I have already committed to a dozen other 65% boards. Would possibly trade for any interesting boards.

Shipping is **not included in the price**, but will split the shipping 50/50 with Canadians.   
Trade preference goes to BC>Canada>NA>Rest of the world

Please comment before PM.

**Info**

Just getting rid of some items I have excess of and looking for a good home!

Items are not FCFS, are OBO (below asking), and shipping included to CONUS. Bundles are convenient and happy to negotiate a reasonable bundle price. It's also generally helpful if messages are clear and actionable (provide ZIP and PayPal in the initial message so I can quote shipping quickly). Unless they are marked as sold, they are still available.

CONUS shipping only because shipping internationally is not easy, especially with the pandemic.

Discord: flatwhite#0009

Reddit: PM only, I will not respond to any chats. Comment before PM'ing please.

I'm going to bed soon, will answer messages in the morning if I don't get to it tonight.

~~This probably won't be first come first served, as I'd like to see if I can sell some of the items as bundles.~~ 

~~I live in Norway so shipping rates may be higher than EU/US people are used to. Probably talking 10-20$ for the light packages, and 20-30$ for the heavy ones (M60a, Tex).~~

Item | Condition | Price
----|---------|-----
Rama M60-a Dusk SEQ1 | Only used for 3-4 days, rest of the time spent in the box, no extra inner weight. Hotswap PCB. Unfortunately the time in storage has left the brass backweight with some small oxidation marks, not visible at distance or in many types of light, but can be seen during close inspection. Hard to capture on camera, but I included two pictures that show the marks. I contacted Rama Works about it, and they said it's an issue with the coating they use - it needs to be cleaned very carefully before being put away for storage, and I guess just using the provided cloth wasn't enough... Unfortunately, the oxidation marks can't be removed like on normal brass without also damaging the PVD coating. If you are the kind of person who requires utter flawlessness, then this board may not be for you unless you want to bypass the coating or try to get a replacement brass weight from Rama (I hear they may have extras from ongoing M60a runs) | ~~Asking 450$ + shipping.~~ **sold**
GMK Plum  | Comes with tray. Used 3-4 days. Unfortunately a factory defect on the 7U spacebar as can be seen in one of the pics. The other 2 spacebars are fine. | ~~130$ + shipping.~~ **sold**

[Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/FWVkGXl)

The keyboards in the timestamp are sold without keycaps.

[TGR A17 replica](https://imgur.com/a/XFzDd4T): bought from r/mm a couple of months ago, but was unfortunately [damaged](https://i.imgur.com/udzJTFD.jpg) in shipping (see pics); it is just a hairline crack on the top acrylic layer, but it does not affect the functionality whatsoever. Built on a black h87a (mini USB) with lubed Gateron Milky Blacks; types like a dream. Got a new main TKL so this is just gathering dust.  Can provide sound test upon request. $260 shipped, but can include coiled, grey mini USB aviator for an additional $40.

**Brutal60 (proto) +Instant60 PCB**: bought from local seller in July. Haven't been using this board lately so I might as well sell it; comes on a polycarb plate, baby blue C3 stabs, and shelf liner in the bottom part of the case. No visible flaws. Is not compatible with modern brutal60 parts due to it having different plate mounting points. Asking for $300 shipped, but can leave the NK Silk yellows (spring-swapped to Sprit 68g Heavy; uniformly re-applied with 205g0) for an additional $60.

**~~GMK Olivia++ with Spacebars Kit~~**~~: NIB sealed, and not willing to split. Wanted to gift to my sister, but went with giving Peach Blossom instead. $310 shipped.~~   **Sold for $300 shipped**

**ePBT Kuroshiro R2 (base+JP mods)**: Was part of the GB: mounted for pics, and used in a typing test. Took it off because I do not like the feel of ePBT when compared to ABS caps like GMK. $240 shipped

**~~SA Bliss Base:~~** ~~I wanted to like this, but uniform R3 was not my cup of tea. Used extremely lightly, about 2 hours max. $220 shipped~~ **Sold for asking**

**SA Ice Caps**: Bought this to make a [bootleg 'olivia' colorway](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/hrzcyz/i_wish_i_had_the_real_ones/) when combined with SA Bliss. Again, not my cup of tea due to R3 profile. Bundle with SA Bliss base to emulate the above for $275 shipped, or buy by itself for $70 shipped.

Please post before PM-ing. Due to current world affairs, priority goes to local (91030) and then CONUS.

Hello! Selling some stuff to make way for PC upgrades. Everything is OBO, and I hopefully think priced fairly. Things will not be FCFS, but to people I know won't just flip the caps/ board. Comment PM b4 pming!
KBD8XMkii - Polycarb WKL, built with Gateron milk blacks on a fr4 plate, milk top black bottom. Lubed with 205g0, Spring swapped to 70g tx springs (14mm), and filmed with Deskeys film. Brass weight, and missing a screw. Board is very well kept, no scratches on usb port / back. 0 signs of yellowing, brass weight has machining marks (that's p normal). Only one small scuff, will send picture if interested. $550 shipped.

~~GMK Olivia + Spacebars - Never mounted, only opened to check caps for any warpage. Keys are all good! Packaging got slightly damaged in transit unfortunately. Looks a bit smooshed, but caps are pristine. PM if you want more pics. Both kits for $290 shipped, bundle w/ kbd8x for $825 shipped.~~ SOLD TO u/elliotheressa_325

~~GMK Mizu Base - Man, this hasn't been listed on mechmarket in a fat while, huh? I know I'm probably gonna get a SHITTON of dms in the next 5 minutes. We'll do this: first person to guess what my favorite league character is, gets first priority on the caps. (Assuming you're not a flipper, new account, etc etc lol). Selling for $235 shipped in bags. Caps are in grear condition, they were mounted for the first time recently on the kbd8x and used for barely a month. Literally bought them together just for that reason. Now I'm kinda not vibing with it, and prefer monochrome sets. Can also bundle with the kbd8x, shipped as it looks, for $800.~~ SOLD TO u/Soraikuuuu for Asking!

HHKB P2 - Honestly don't know what to do with this. Bought it to work on as a project, don't use it anymore. Kinda sits there, menacingly, repeatedly yelling me to mod it. Please, someone help a pour soul, and take it off my hands. Modded w/ JTK MX sliders + stabs, lubed w/ 205g0. Comes with original caps and sliders. No original packaging. $150 shipped.

Lastly, this damn Senna statue. I hate senna as a champ with all my heart. Dumbest ADC ever made. If you want it, it's free, but I'll judge you. From the league mini set for True DMG.

Bundles get priority! Once again, comment PM b4 pming.

here's a hint btw on my fave champ on league, it's part of the true dmg lineup. :>",purchased gmk mizu base from u/theechoeffect,"[US-CA] [H] KBD8XMkii PC WKL TKL, GMK Olivia Light base + Spacebars, GMK Mizu Base, HHKB Pro 2 + accessories [W] PayPal, Trades"

Note that the asking price for all the kits included covers what I paid for these items. I just want to get back what I paid. I tried to price the bundles in such a way that, the bigger the bundle you get, the more discount you can get. So here are the smaller bundles pricing-

# There will be discount if you bundle; All prices include PayPal fee and shipping to CONUS

via DHL air in HK. There is gonna be a $5-7 surcharge on shipping to other parts of the world. Remote charge might occur depending on your address so please pm it to me to check. Feel free to msg me about shipping in Asia because there might be discount from the courier.

The typical timeframe is 1-2 weeks, including domestic shipping to the proxy, their processing time in HK (3 days usually), time that cargos waiting for pick-up at bay and the time on flight to the destinations. It is pretty reliable since COVID-19. [Here's some DHL tracking after they pick up the package.](https://imgur.com/a/czxgagT)

Sold sets will be striked-thru. I do prefer bundle so it won't be FCFS.

Hello mechmarket!

Today I am finally letting go of the first keyboard that got me hooked into the hobby! This Savage is in great condition and I have enjoyed all the time that I have had with it.

**~~A-Stock Green Savage65 w/ 7U FR4 Plate, milmax PCB, and Desoldered PCB - $415 + Shipping or OBO~~**    **SOLD for $400 + Shipping**

This board has served me through thick and thin and it was so much fun to play with and I really had a good time with it. On the back you may notice that the cannon is gold and that is from an infill I did with some acrylic paint (I have a YouTube video about how I did it). Aside from that, everything should be in great condition. It will only come with the 7U plate but has both a desoldered PCB that is fully functional and a milmax PCB with full size backspace.",sold gmk first love novs to u/marvingreyphoto,[US-NY] [H] A-Stock Green Savage65 with gold infill and extra PCB [W] Paypal

Today I have got this beautiful black unikorn for sale. It is currently built with a brass plate and lubed alpacas. It comes with another sealed singa pcb and brass plate, and a 60% TX carry case.

Selling this because I am moving soon and I don't want to take any my KB stuff with me. I've had my fun with this hobby but it is time for me to move onto other things :)

The prices listed are for the caps with trays. There will be shipping added pending how many kits you want. I would prefer to sell them to someone within the United States to avoid international shipping headaches.

This left no lasting marks, but there is still left over Plasti-dip on the inside of the case and in the switch slots of the plate, none of this is visible when assembled and in normal use and could be removed with a little effort, I priced accordingly to reflect this.

Prices in USD. Shipping refers to inside the USA. Might ship Wednesday and Friday this week. I need a sizeable financial incentive to ship outside of the US right now. I’m in Houston, local is cheaper. FCFS-sorta. I'm gonna eat dinner and if people have bundle offers thats probably favored. If my prices are way off-like something Im selling has obv gone unsold at the price I'm listing, cite your sources and send an offer.

~~[GMK Ceresia](https://imgur.com/a/ScQUFLr), WS1 white on P3 red, so same white as GMK Minimal. Red same as Handarbeit, upcoming Red Alert next year.

Hey /r/mechmarket, I've been making commisioned cables for a few months now with 20+ satisfied customers and so I've decided to brand myself as **Curlicue Cables**! Consider this post a *soft-opening* for my first batch of  **ready-to-ship cables.**

&nbsp;

So many people are making cables these days, and I've noticed prices for keycap-inspired cables that are just *too damn high*, anywhere from $70-$100, with a lead time of several months, GB-style! Nobody likes to wait, which is why I'm making themed cables at affordable prices in large batches, **ready-to-ship.**

&nbsp;

**My cable process:** USB2.0-spec shielded cable is sleeved with high-quality paracord and double-sleeved with genuine Flexo-PET Techflex for quality and durability. Once sleeved, Cables are coiled at 3/8"" using Zap Coil Collars (no tape!) and oven baked, freezed to cool, baked and cooled once more, and reverse-coiled for a [springy, quality coil](https://imgur.com/ojWIwWZ). That's a total of **three heat/cool cycles**, one more than most vendors! [Connections are soldered](https://imgur.com/fyEYGJA) at 300 degrees using Kester 63/37 leaded solder, and heatshrink applied carefully with a heat-gun.

Cable Colorway | Description | Qty. Remaining | Price 
------------------|--------------|------------------|-------
[Clean White](https://imgur.com/VJidmUU) | For those who want a clean, simple cable that matches with anything | ~~1~~ 0 | $50
[Water](https://imgur.com/lwW2rUC) | Color-matched with a certain popular set, Mizu | ~~1~~ 0 | $50
[Stormtrooper](https://imgur.com/0fyVi1a) | Miss all your blaster shots with this cable, also known as BoW | ~~2~~ 0  | $60
*Shipping $6 CONUS* in a [8""x8"" box, shipped securely in a bubble-wrapped sleeve](https://imgur.com/LFwpoe5).

&nbsp;

The next batch of these colorways will be in much higher quantity, ~10. I'd appreciate your feedback in the comments or DM on these colorways, and if you have a specific modification you'd like to one of these cables, such as adding the black aviator to the Mizu cable, changing heatshrink colors, or changing coil direction/placement, please let me know! If you are interested in one of these cables for the next large batch and would like a modification, DM me and I'll take your preferences into consideration.",bought gmk olivia++ light base and dark base and spacebar kit from u/lukeski14,"[US-IN][H] Curlicue Cables | White/Black & Mizu Coiled + Detachable Cables, Ready to Ship [W] PayPal"

I want to sell some of the early purchases I made (which I am all very happy about TBH) as I go deeper into this blackhole :) Please leave a comment here before PM and I'd prefer local pick-up (CA 95131) over shipping (otherwise FCFS) just because that would be much easier for the heavy keyboards, shipping is CONUS only.

Retooled MX Black frankenswitch x84 | 16mm 62g springs, Tx films, Lubed 205g0, milky bottom. I desolder these from a board I bought from another member. Interesting frankenswitch. The 16mm springs are similar to Sprit slow springs where more force is required at the top. The milky bottom seems to reduce the sounds relative to the mx housing.

Board is in excellent condition, PCB has been desoldered once and tested, all functionality of the PCB is working properly.

The board is great sounding and has a very nice RGB aesthetic, but the layout isn't for me and I have too many other boards coming, so I'm letting this one go.

I Am a Artist by Trade, My Mother has her own art studio and passed her love of all art mediums down to me. I also love building Keyboards because Lubing Switches truly is an Art Form

I have been perfecting the ART of lubing switches for a long time and through my journey, I have come to realize a few things. Tub/Bag lube makes very consistent good results but IMO I believe that the only way to truly make every switch perfect is to hand lube each by hand. It takes a lot longer but I lube every customer switch the same way that I lube Switches for my Personal Builds. I use only what I consider to be the best supplies, I test every switch in a hot swap board before I ship them out to make sure that each and every one is perfect.

Hello fellow clackers, I have a few goodies for sale. Please read the notes completely!

All items will be shipped securely in a box. **CONUS only (sorry international)**

|[**SA Laser (Gaijin & Obnet Sets)**](https://drop.com/buy/drop-mito-sa-laser-custom-keycap-set)|[IMGUR Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/o3Cc1JC) Used as my daily driver for a month. There is moderate shine on the alphas and mods. No missing keys. There are no issues with mounting except for one or two ""loose"" keys. These keys mount fine; they just require a bit less force to remove. The 6.25u spacebar has slightly damaged MX mounts on the left and right side. This results in the spacebar lifting off the stabilizers when pressed too far to the sides. To fix this, you can apply a bit of teflon tape to the stabilizer mounts (which is what I did). Issue shown in the pictures. [Pics & Video of Shine](https://imgur.com/a/566ckXa)|**$190 shipped PayPal G&S**|

Hi All,

I have a set of GMK 9009 R3 Base keys that are BNIB/sealed. I'm looking to trade them for a set of GMK Phosphorous. I need the base and numpad sets. I'd also like the spacebars, but that's optional. I don't mind if they're not brand new, as long as they're in good condition and all sets are complete. I'd add money (through PayPal G&S) on top of my GMK 9009 base set to make the trade equal.

Alternatively, if anyone wants to just sell me their GMK Phosphorous set, I'd be down for that too!

Please comment here before PMing and don't use chat. Thanks!

board is built in the picture but would be desoldered before shipping. but the board could be built up with h1 or mauves lubed and filmed if you want for an extra €70

The board has a small scratch on the rounded front on the right side and the smallest anode blemish just above that refer to last picture in the timestamp album. and there are some mini scratches on the clear coat on the brass weight but nothing a light polish can't get rid of.

Hi keeb warriors,

Hope everyone is having a nice chilly Autumn so far (chilly here in the Bay at least). Selling some stuff to make up for the 3070 I was able to purchase at my local computer store. **Not FCFS, will be prioritizing local sales near 94403 and if I have to ship it will be CONUS only.** Will list prices for both local and shipped for each item.

**Please leave a comment before shooting me a pm, and all chat messages will be ignored**

I'm also casually looking for a RAMA boxr artistan, either emperor or king. Will pay for a reasonable price.

Have a good rest of your day!

Hello keeb warriors,

Before shooting me a pm, know that I am **looking to sell this board for cash locally around the 94403 area only**.  If I don't sell this board in a few days, then I will relist this for shipping CONUS only.  I am selling this board with the switches installed and will not separate them (**no keycaps included**). Doing this because installing the switches with the plate foam was quite tedious and difficult, and I don't want the buyer to possibly ruin a switch or socket.  Board will come with its carrying case.

~~Asking price: $300 cash~~ **-SOLD-**

Please no chat, just leave a comment then shoot me a pm. Thanks and have a great day!

**NK65v2 Specs**:

* **E-White Alu Case**: Bought this BNIB from a user on this sub, used it for about a month then have had it sitting pretty on display for another. No dents, only 2 miniscule scratches on the edge of the board next to the backspace, caused from mishandling my tool trying to remove the stock stabs that were on. Negligible with caps mounted, check timestamp for detailed pic.
* **NK65 PCB:** USB-C and Hotswap. Mounted only once with the creams. VIA compatible.
* **NK Cream Switches**: Stem, housing, and springs lubed with Krytox 205g0.  Had these babies since April so now they're dummy smooth without that leathery feel to them.  Pm me if you want a sound test and I'll send a Google link
* **Gateron plate mount stabs:** Didn't like the stock cherry stabs this kit came with and had these on hand. Lubed with Krytox 205g0
* **Black Aluminum Plate:** Top mount
* **2 Dampeners:** Silicone Case Dampener that came with kit and StupidFish Plate foam bought seperately",sold gmk sandstorm to u/basiliskwang,"[US-CA] [H] Built NK65v2 E-White Alu Edition w/ NK Creams, Gateron Stabs and foam [W] Local Cash"

Hello Mechmarket.

I want to sell this beautiful keyboard for exactly the same as i paid for it brand new from Ungodly.designs. I was lucky to win the raffle but the layout isn't for me sadly.

I got 6 different gaskets for it that i will add for free, and both a solder and a Hotswap PCB that also is included free of charge.

The price takes into consideration : Danish import VAT (25%) + Import Fee (24 Euro) and paypal fees.

Should the price however still seem to high for you and you really want this keyboard, im willing to take a offer. I really need to free up some cash for christmas.

Thanks!

via DHL air in HK. There is gonna be a $5-7 surcharge on shipping to other parts of the world. Remote charge might occur depending on your address so please pm it to me to check. Feel free to msg me about shipping in Asia because there might be discount from the courier.

The typical timeframe is 1-2 weeks, including domestic shipping to the proxy, their processing time in HK (3 days usually), time that cargos waiting for pick-up at bay and the time on flight to the destinations. It is pretty reliable since COVID-19. [Here's some DHL tracking after they pick up the package.](https://imgur.com/a/czxgagT)

Edit 1 at 10:45PM THESE WILL BE SHIPPED FROM CALIFORNIA, SORRY I COPY AND PASTED ANOTHER TITLE FROM MECHMARKET AND FORGOT TO EDIT LOCATION

Edit 2 at 11:53PM Hi everything has sold. I apologize if I did not get to everyone! Have a wonderful week. 

Hi selling some products I will not be using.

~~NK Vaporware- Asking 60 shipped mounted once and typed on for less than 30 minutes. Purchased to see how it'd look really. Not available on Novelkeys at the moment, roughly the same price you'd pay MSRP with shipping, checking right now and to order the NK WoB would roughly be 66.33. Using NK WoB as reference since you can't add vaporware to cart. Pricing breakdown on their website as follow. SOLD~~

~~$50 keycaps, $11.45 USPS priority mail, and $4.88 tax~~

~~NK WoB- Same reasoning as NK Vaporware, asking $60 shipped this set has not been mounted at all. - Currently pending SOLD~~

~~GMK WoB (Missing spacebars + 3 white keycaps)- Asking $70 shipped. Purchased originally from Drop, probably received it 2-3 weeks ago? Reason for purchasing I wanted the spacebars and the white keycaps it comes with, if you've seen my previous post I was looking for black spacebars in a specific GMK colorware so I decided to purchase GMK WoB to get the spacebars haha, also took interest in the white keycaps that it comes with. Looking to get 70 shipped which I believe is more than fair considering the missing spacebar and 3 white keycaps. If you're in need of spacebars originative still has GMK spacebars, nothing in black though but other colors if you wanted something more colorful!- currently pending~~

~~NK VAPORWARE- 60 SHIPPED~~

~~NK WOB- 60 SHIPPED~~

~~GMK WOB (MISSING KEYS)- 70 SHIPPED~~

These will be shipped via USPS. I will try my best to get it dropped off to my post office Friday/ Saturday. If I am unable to then it will be first thing Monday morning, if you're not okay with this then please do not purchase. As always, please comment before PM'ing. As per usual if you send a chat I will not respond. Thank you! And stay safe!",bought gmk wob from u/soraikuuuu,"[US-GA] [H] NK Vaporware, NK WoB, GMK WOB(Missing some keys and spacebars) [W] PayPal"

EDIT Only items available are the ID80 PCB and KBDfans 5 degree case! Thank  you so far for the interest!

Hi all morning! Haven't gone to sleep yet so went through some more stuff I impulsively bought during quarantine! Trying to sell things to save some funds and fund other things such as bills and other boards I may purchase later on lol. I'll try to keep things short and simple this time around!

~~SOLD- 1) Red Tokyo V2 w/ acrylic diffuser- Purchased this from another user for $170. Looking to get $150 shipped. Board is in great condition nothing wrong, works perfectly fine. Includes cherry clipped/ lubed cherry screw in stabs. I had holy pandas installed on this then removed.-SOLD~~

~~2) Rose Gold Tokyo V1 (VIA Compatible)- Purchased this from another user for $180 (Really should have asked for more pictures.) Board works perfectly find there is a dent/ ding on the bottom plate of the board and it seems like the board has a little gap on the bottom portion right side of the board. Has lubed cherry screw in stabs, not sure if they're clipped or not haven't opened this board since purchasing. There are some marks that I pictured but nothing extreme. Looking to get $130 shipped.~~

For the Tokyo Boards just a heads up drop is having pre orders for a v4 kit offering 4 different colorways black, slate, silver, and coyote eta is around December. So basically before the year ends, just want to be transparent since I'm selling older models.

~~3) Instant 60 PCBs Tsangan Layout Combo- Purchased extra PCBs when putting together some HHKB boards for some friends went another route hence why I have two still. I just realized after taking the picture there is some lube on the PCBs I've wiped it off so it isn't sticky but it did get on the PCB so there's some discoloration but doesn't affect the PCB in anyway in terms of functionality. This is a combo because the PCB that has the landing pads some of the hotswap sockets need the pins pushed back towards the middle. They weren't initially working at first but I did push everything back myself using a pin needle. Have only installed switches on this PCB once so I don't know if they need to be pushed back. The second PCB I never got to personally use but did do a tweezer test and all keys register. Looking to get 75 SHIPPED. Just do note from what I mentioned regarding the first PCB you might have to push the pins back to the middle (the golden part on the underside of the PCB.) These are on cannonkeys usually going for 60 for one currently OOS. So I'm fairly confident you're getting a good deal from me!~~

4) ID 80 PCB from Idobao- Purchased this directly from their site. It retails for $65, Looking to get $45 shipped selling at a loss. Not too sure why I bought it in the first place. But who knows maybe you'll have a use for it!

~~5) KBDFans 5 Degree Gray Case- Purchased this a couple months ago I think I paid around $90 for it, in used condition. I am asking $60 shipped, NO SCREWS INCLUDED. This is a used board so there maybe some small scuffs on the board which I tried my best to picture this thing is heavy lol, no blockers are included.~~

~~6) Keyboard Belle 1984 Case- I believe I got this for around $60? Way back then I built in it once then disassembled. I'm asking for $40 shipped, NO SCREWS INCLUDED with this just the case itself. Do note this is a 3D Printed case so there maybe imperfections due to 3D printing process. But honestly the board looks amazing and is in great condition!~~

~~7) Drop HOLY PANDAS 1st drop I believe- I counted this I have 67, little back story I got this with the red tokyo 60. These are my first tactile switches and I did not like them. So I decided to lube them HEAVY. These things are heavily lubed with krytos 205g0 but I went crazy and lubed the whole stem and everything lol. Because of this I am taking that into account with my pricing. I am asking for $50 shipped. I paid $1 dollar a switch $67 (I purchased 70 don't know where 3 of them went)~~

Hi mechmarket, I have a couple things I would like to sell today, not looking to trade this time because my keyboard expenditure has gotten out of control.

CONUS buyers only, please

Please note that there is a second sale of the Mode Eighty First Edition on 11/17, where 300 units will be offered (hotswap option available then). Also, there are currently B-stock units available at [Mode Design's website](https://shop.modedesigns.com/collections/first-edition-release/products/eighty-case-only?variant=32741173395538).

Anyhow, I'm selling the Mode Eighty because it was an impulse buy (did it in the bathroom at work) and it's simply too expensive for me to use personally (and I don't have a soldering iron). As such, I'm looking to sell it basically at cost to me (paid quite a lot over retail due to taxes mainly). I have not taken the keyboard out of the wrapping paper in fear of smudging its incredibly beautiful backside.

Local buyers strongly preferred, especially for the Mode Eighty, so if you happen to be located in/near Orange County and are willing to travel to somewhere close to me, that would be great and I can provide a little discount.

|Item|Condition|Price|

Hi mechmarket, I'm back again to sell my Mode Eighty, along with a used ePBT WoB set

As usual, CONUS buyers only, please

Local buyers (Orange County) strongly preferred, especially for the keyboard.

**Mode Eighty First Edition - Light**

For transparency, I paid a total of $701.51 for this keyboard.

These are still in stock at Mode Design's [website](https://shop.modedesigns.com/collections/first-edition-release/products/eighty-case-only?variant=32741173395538), along with the pre-orders (good price, really nice colour options available, and delivery in January).

The keyboard has not been taken out of the paper wrapper (I was scared that I would smudge the bottom), and all the accessories are still in their original packaging, only thing I've done is take pictures.

Asking $678 + shipping

**ePBT WoB**

This set has been used for around 1.5 months on my NK65. No shine as far as I can tell, and the only keys I have used are the 65% ones (I have included a picture of my NK65 in the timestamp so you can see which keys I have used).

~~Asking $59 + shipping~~ SOLD

**Both the Mode Eighty and ePBT WoB**

~~Asking $717 + shipping~~ ePBT WoB SOLD

Not exactly looking to trade at the moment, sorry

Feel free to PM me if you have any inquiries

Hi mechmarket, I've returned again, this time with quite a nice keeb to sell/trade, and also the GMK Cafe and Spacebars from before.

CONUS only, please

**ai03 Polaris**

New, sealed (box opened to take pictures, but everything inside remains sealed)

\-Grey WK version

\-Brass weight (Gold color)

\-FR4 full plate (it's black and does not look like brass or PC, so I came to this conclusion)

Comes with all the accessories that came with it.

~~Asking $666 + shipping~~ SOLD

Or

Trades for mid- to high-end 65% (non-PC) keebs, preferences and notes listed below

Got this in today and it was a whole lot prettier than I had imagined. I kind of don't want to sell it that much now that I've seen it in person, but I'm posting it here if someone really wants it and I can use this money towards something that suits me even better since I'm more of a 65% guy (65% > 60%, literally), but I wouldn't mind keeping this beauty at all :)

**GMK Cafe Base and Spacebar Kit**

New, sealed

I thought I had secured a local buyer from my last post, but I haven't heard back for over a day (please message back, man), so I'm posting this bundle here since I got the Polaris today.

~~Asking $379 shipped CONUS~~ SOLD

Or

Trades for mid- to high-end 65% (non-PC) keebs, preferences and notes listed below

Oh, I forgot to include the Alpaca switches:

**75x Alpaca Switches (stock)**

The timestamp picture shows a bag of 150 Alpacas, but I'm only selling 75 of them because the rest is for personal use and I got some Tangerines yesterday.

~~Asking $51 + shipping~~ SOLD

I know that they are still in stock at PrimeKB, but this price is not really extravagant and I probably ship a lot faster than PrimeKB (no offense intended, great store).

For trades:

I'll add PayPal if necessary, but keep in mind that I'm not rich and don't want to blow over $1k (total, along with the Polaris and/or GMK Cafe bundle) on a keeb.

Boards I'm most interested in (many over $1k market price, but I want to try nonetheless because they're such nice keebs):

\-Iron165

\-Chimera

\-Constellation (failed to get one last friday because of the chaos)

\-Key65 (preferrably with logo blocker)

If you have any questions, please feel free to PM me

Thank you and have a wonderful day :)",sold gmk cafe base + spacebars to /u/occasionalirrelevant,"[US-CA][H]Polaris Grey WK, GMK Cafe Base + Spacebars, PayPal [W]PayPal, 65% Keeb Trades"

Hi mechmarket, I have 2 things I would like to sell/trade

CONUS buyers only, please

Check the bottom of this post for trades

**ePBT x GOK BoW**

I bought 2 of these, but decided that it's probably better that I don't tempt myself with buying more keebs :)

~~Asking for $123 + shipping~~ SOLD

**NK65 Aluminum E-White**

This keeb was built on September 29th and used since, it was built with:

* Gateron Ink Blacks (v2), lubed with Krytox 205g0 and filmed with Deskeys films
* Stabs have been clipped and lubed (205g0 for the housing and dielectric grease for the wire)
* ePBT ABS WoB keycaps (no shine as far as I can tell)

The only imperfection I could find is a small spot under the spacebar, which was not caused by me, and I have included a photo of it.

The carrying case (unused) and coiled cable (unused, it is a white-ish cable, not the black one) are included.

~~Asking $289 + shipping for the bundle excluding keycaps (ePBT WoB)~~ SOLD

~~Asking $355 + shipping for the bundle including keycaps (ePBT WoB)~~

&#x200B;

Both items are available for trade (I would prefer to trade my NK65 rather than sell it), but only for keyboards

For trades, I'm interested in mid- to high-end 65% keebs (non-PC preferred), with PayPal on my end, of course, but I'm not looking to straight up buy a keeb, hence the trade to offset some of the cost

Not interested in keebs like Cannonkeys' brutalist boards, any KBDFans boards (already bought the D65), or the like, sorry :(

For reference, boards over $1k are out of my budget, I know that this budget is not much, but wanted to try nonetheless.

Please feel free to PM me if you have any questions

The board was 450 shipped to me from China about a year ago, and the switches cost me $100 - so the way it's priced right now is less than what I paid for it.  This is my 4th price reduction down from 600, but I can't really go much lower than this... I do need to sell it though...  I want to make my reasoning for selling at a loss clear though: it's not because I don't think the board is nice - on the contrary, it's a super nice and very unique keyboard (the arrow cluster is really cool I think).  I simply have too many boards coming in over the next few months and I want to both send this to someone who will use it and use the money from this sale to pay down some of the things I've got on the way!

Hello, r/mechmarket

Today I am clearing out some of the boards, keycaps, switches, deskmat, wrist rest for another build in the future.

Will be using paypal g&s and all prices include paypal fees and shipping.

I will be only shipping to CONUS as shipping international is a bit difficult with the current situation.

If any of the prices seem unreasonable, feel free to send an offer as well.

Please comment and send me a PM!

Hello, r/mechmarket

Today I am clearing out some of the boards, keycaps, switches, deskmat, wrist rest for another build in the future.

Will be using paypal g&s and all prices include paypal fees and shipping.

I will be only shipping to CONUS as shipping international is a bit difficult with the current situation.

If any of the prices seem unreasonable, feel free to send an offer as well.

Please comment and send me a PM!

~~**70x 67g SoHos** - bought these in case I missed out on Alpacas.

~~**Hex.3C FR4 Plate** - plate was cut slightly too wide (cutouts are fine and everything), so you can sand down the outer edges, or just use a bit of force to close the keyboard (worked with my keyboard). Plate was cut using the universal alu/brass file. Asking **$18 shipped**.~~

~~I have 59x NK Silk Yellows that have been relubed with 205g0, springs lubed with 105 oil, and filmed with Deskey films. For some reason, when I opened up my switches, the stems were dry as a bone... so maybe ""relubed"" is the wrong term haha. I'm looking for **$45 shipped** for these.~~

~~I also have 2x Black FR4 Hex.3C plates. These were cut using the Universal Alu plate file, they are cut a little big and have a very tight fit on the hex top but it works. You could sand it yourself but I don't have the materials to do so before selling these :/ Looking for **$17 shipped**.~~

Hey Mechmarket!

Icarus flew too close to the sun and got ahead of himself chasing theme builds. Now he needs help cleaning his closet! Tried to price everything cheaper than anywhere else, if I missed something let me know.

\*\*I'm happy to lube/mod any switch or stab set per request. Just keep in mind this will increase cost and may add lead time to shipment.\*\*

To get the boring stuff out of the way:

* Prices include shipping, CONUS only
* Shipping will have tracking - Insurance provided on orders over $100
* **Prioritizing bundles**
* Comment before PM
* No reddit chats, please!
* Orders ship next day, unless otherwise stated

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for looking!

Hi All,

I've got a NK65ee Frost and GMK Umbra base for sale.

~~The~~ **~~NK65 Entry Edition Frost~~** ~~is barely used. I purchased it new on~~ r/mechmarket~~, tried it once and decided that I didn't like the angle and that I need a numpad. Asking for $130 shipped (CONUS).~~ \***SOLD FOR ASKING PRICE\***

~~The~~ **~~GMK Umbra Base~~** ~~kit is also barely used. After several weeks of fruitless searching for a GMK Phosphorous set, I purchased this kit BNIB on~~ r/mechmarket ~~in the hopes that it would look good on my blue Southpaw 65 Extended (it didn't). It was mounted and typed on once. Asking $250 shipped (CONUS) in box.~~ **\*SOLD FOR ASKING PRICE\***

I'd be VERY INTERESTED a trade for the GMK Phosphorous base, numpad, and spacebar kits. The base and numpad kits are required for me, but the spacebars kits are optional. Depending on which items are involved, I'd be willing to add Paypal G&S on my end to even out the trade.

Please comment before PM.

Hi All,

I have a set of GMK 9009 R3 Base keys that are BNIB/sealed. I'm looking to trade them for a set of GMK Phosphorous. I need the base and numpad sets. I'd also like the spacebars, but that's optional. I don't mind if they're not brand new, as long as they're in good condition and all sets are complete. I'd add money (through PayPal G&S) on top of my GMK 9009 base set to make the trade equal.

Alternatively, if anyone wants to just sell me their GMK Phosphorous set, I'd be down for that too!

RAMA U80A Moon | Built w/ Gateron Silent Black Inks lubed with 205g0 and spring swapped with 65g TX springs and Durock Stabilizers lubed with 205g0. Comes with MT3 Susawatari Keycaps barely used. The pictures look like there is shine but it is just the nature of the plastic used. Also comes with extra Rose Gold external weight and Internal Dampener. The keyboard came with machining marks on bottom corner of the board straight from RAMA (Not caused by me). Not visible during use. Pictures of the marks [here](https://imgur.com/a/rNmIMp9) | **1250$ Shipped for everything. Not selling weight seperately, please don't ask** $1200 w/o the keycaps

~~CannonKeys Navy Savage65~~ | ~~From the last drop. A-stock with flawless condition on the exterior. I believe there is some marks in the inside straight from CannonKeys but since its only the inside, it is considered a-stock by CannonKeys standards. Built w/ C3 Tangerines V2 (spring swapped to 65g TX Springs and lubed with 205g0) and Durock Stabilizers (Lubed w/ 205g0). PCB is millmaxed with 0305 sockets and the FR4 plate is the 6.25u spacebar variant. Comes w/ CannonKeys carrying case, sheet of neoprene foam inside the keyboard, and the polyfill in case you wanted that too. **Does not come with keycaps**~~ | **SOLD for 440$**
Switch Couture Matte Black Alice | Bottom is frosted acrylic to let the underglow RGB shine through. Will come with the extra matte black bottom piece if you wanted to swap it out. Comes with frosted acrylic feet installed.

The typical timeframe is 1-2 weeks, including domestic shipping to the proxy, their processing time in HK (3 days usually), time that cargos waiting for pick-up at bay and the time on flight to the destinations. It is pretty reliable since COVID-19. [Here's some DHL tracking after they pick up the package.](https://imgur.com/a/czxgagT)

~~About the 60% KN2.10²: It is a sandwich mount keyboard with a 60% ANSI layout and hotswap pcb. It comes with the following:~~

* ~~Lubed, clipped (Zeals come clipped from factory), and band-aid modded Zeal stabs~~
* ~~Lubed and filmed 63.5g Turquoise Tealios~~
* ~~DZ60RGBV2 PCB~~
* ~~Sorbothane lined bottom case and KBDFans modular plate foam on plate~~

~~This keyboard sounds incredible and is super quiet. In full transparency, there are scratches to the plate from taking switches in and out as I tested them. There are also some scratches around the inner edges of the top case but both these and the plate scratches are not visible when the keyboard is put together. See the extra pictures if you want to check this out. This has been a great keyboard for me but I am making the leap to gasket mount. Selling for $300. SOLD~~

Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

I am selling my KN2.10² that is e-white bottom, black plate, and e-yellow top. It is a sandwich mount keyboard with a 60% ANSI layout and hotswap pcb. It comes with the following:

* Lubed, clipped, and band-aid modded Zeal stabs
* Lubed and filmed 63.5g Turquoise Tealios
* DZ60RGBV2 PCB
* Sorbothane lined bottom case and KBDFans modular plate foam on plate

&#x200B;

This keyboard sounds incredible and is super quiet. In full transparency, there are a lot of scratches to the plate from taking switches in and out as I tested them. There are also some scratches around the inner edges of the top case but both these and the plate scratches are not visible when the keyboard is put together. This has been a great keyboard for me but I am making the leap to gasket mount.

&#x200B;

Feel free to let me know if you have any questions and I will be more than happy to answer them.

Asking $420 for the complete setup shipped. Prefer not to separate the parts.

Hey mechmarket! I impulsively bought this GMK Dots set from another user and I only bought em cause I thought they looked cool lol. I am selling this as I don’t use this keycap set and I would like to use the money for Christmas gifts. They are in mint condition. Keep in mind, the seal in the picture has been broken off and has been mounted once or twice from the previous owner. I personally haven’t used or mounted these at all, only to look at. I inspected and these have no shine or wear at all and I am asking for $340 Shipped! I can negotiate pricing within reason as well. (shipping to CONUS) 

Please pm me if u have any questions or concerns!

Hello Mechmarket! Today I'm offloading a build I've been using for the past few weeks:

* Silver Tofu 60% Case (has EVA foam up to screw mounts)
* Brass Plate (many scratches from pulling switches over and over, doesn't affect sound or feel at all)
* 1up HSE PCB (ANSI layout with 6.25u spacebar)
* Durock Smokey Stabilizers (These are the V1s, lubed with Krytox 205g0 on the stems, Dielectric Grease on the wires)
* Free keycaps from an Anne Pro 1
* Optional foam between plate and PCB (just ask)
* ~~Optional Aluminum plate~~

Looking to get $245 shipped for this with the brass plate ~~or $220 with just the aluminum plate (no brass).~~ Can bundle with any of the switches below for a discount.

Looking to sell my black WKL Polaris build:

built with:

* v1 gat black inks lubed with krytox 105 gpl and spring swapped to 62g (thic thock DL series springs)
* full pc plate
* pink c3 stabs lubed with 205g0
* brass weight
* both plate and case foam installed

looking for £475 shipped in the EU (BT price)

£500 PayPal (higher becuase of 4.5 percent PayPal fees)

not fcfs, doesn't include caps and I wouldn't recommend buying it if you're outside the EU since you're paying EU price

**information about damage:**

**TLDR: there's damage (not visible once fully built) around one of the screw holes on the inside of the case and one of the screw threads still remains which means there are only 7 screws securing the top case to the bottom case. however despite this once fully built there's almost no visible damage and typing experience is unaffected.**

when I initially tried to build it, one (out of eight) of the hex screws securing the top of the case to the bottom was incredibly tight and hence was stripped very quickly. I tried multiple difference methods to extract the screw peacefully (e.g. araldite) but to no avail. After 6 months of leaving it unbuilt I finally took it to my local key cutting shop where they managed to separate the 2 case parts by drilling the top of the screw head till it was destroyed and came apart. Unfortunately this process left a a reasonable amount of damage around the screw hole on the inside of the case and ofc left the rest of the screw thread intact in the case which means that there are only 7 screws securing the top of the case to the bottom.

I found that despite this, since the board is gasket mounted, the typing experience isn't affected whatsoever and being one of the central screws doesn't affect the structural integrity of the board either.

when you take the case apart there is clearly visible damage around the screw hole in question, however once fully built there is only one tiny scratch on the backside of the board just next to the weight which I will highlight in the pictures.

If you're buying a board for a great typing experience and dont mind knowing that there's some aesthetic damage on the inside then this is an ideal candidate.

I'm sorry for rambling on, the damage is really not as bad as I remembered it to be but I thought id give everyone the full story anyways.",bought gmk burgundy from /u/rankdank420,"[EU-UK][H] built WKL black Polaris (damaged see below) [W] BT, paypal"
