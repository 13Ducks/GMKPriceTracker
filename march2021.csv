Purchased some things that aren’t seeing much use after a move to mostly 40% boards. Comment before PM, I don’t use reddit chat so make sure you send PM. Shipping included to CONUS only. Prioritizing bundles and willing to discount. Happy to negotiate if anything is priced too high, modded switches can be especially hard to value.

**60% hotswap keyboard - $150 shipped**

Case: KeyboardBelle 60% Cassette Futura B-Stock, Beige - only flaw I can see is a small mark on the bottom of the case that isn’t visible when using. Hand-cut foam under PCB that can be removed as needed (it's really tight so doesn't make much difference). Comes with 5-degree 3D-printed wedge to give some angle.

PCB: 1up Keyboards HTE (Hotswap Tsangan Edition) - QMK/VIA compatible, has underglow (which isn’t really visible in the case), hotswap sockets are all in great shape ([store page](https://1upkeyboards.com/shop/controllers/1up-rgb-60-pcb-hte/)). South-facing switch orientation but you'll be fine w/ cherry profile keycaps if you use the included switches as they have longer stems.

Switches: Cherry Silent Red Housing, Kailh Pro Burgundy Stem, Sprit 69g supreme spring (linear), Kebo thin yellow films. Switches lubed w/ Krytox 205g0 on stem and 105 oil on springs. Stock Durock silent linear on spacebar as it’s pretty loud with SA caps but I’ll include another of the Kailh/Cherry switches in case you like the loud space. Switches are pretty thocky and pleasant to type on. [Typing test](https://voca.ro/1fqfZNpShFF3) of the board on a phone mic.

Keycaps: SA Vomit set from Signature Plastics grab bag. A few extras are included here as well if you want different accent enter/esc. Spacebar has hand-cut foam inside, it’s a little scuffed looking but works just fine and I can remove if needed. The Os are scooped homing caps.

Plate: Carbon fiber universal plate - same one as [here](https://3dkeebs.com/collections/everything-else-1/products/carbon-fiber-60-plate?variant=36413205348514) with the 2.25 left shift

Stabs: C3 v2 Dark Grey with steel wire - lubed w/ SuperLube on wire and Tribosys 3204 on sides of stem

Cost breakdown before shipping to me: $35 case/wedge + $45 PCB + $25 plate + \~$25 keycaps + \~$40 switches = $170

Everything is barely used and in great shape but I'm moving to split-space life.

**~~Holy Bobas (pink top)~~** **~~x66 - $95 shipped~~** ~~(will also include 1 Boba U4 Thock and 1 Boba U4 silent in case you want a silent space or need to fill out a 65% board). Lubed using Gazzew method w/ Loob-3g on bottom housing rails, no lube on legs. 68g stock springs donut dipped in blend #3.~~ SOLD FOR ASKING

**U-stem Sky bottom w/ Boba pink top** **x108 - $85 shipped**. UHMWPE stems from 415keys and lubed w/ Tribosys 3204. 65g TX short springs lubed with 105 oil. No need for films with these tight boba tops. Separated/cherry-picked into groups based on how well they held loose-stem Keyreative ABS spacebar. 68 held spacebar tight, 40 had some level of looseness. EnjoyPBT pbt keycaps held well on the vast majority of stems during testing and I would recommend using tighter-stemmed keycaps if you intend to use all 108. Basically par for the course with the u-stems.

There are a couple of scratches on the plate caused by my bad switch puller. 2 of the hotswap socket came off, I jump them to other diodes and all keys are working. The bottom socket which came off of the pcb slightly. The key to put the switches is to hold the plate and push in the socket and switches together, it holds fine.

HI,

I want to sell my GMK Bleached base set and my macropad. The bleached set is opened and has been mounted, I just opened the box took pictures and put them back in. I like the set but really doesn't match any of my boards. The macropad is a Sun20pro macropad from Velocifire and is in the pulse colorway. It looks good and the RGB is amazing but I have no use for it.

Evening y'all,

Had a couple of things I wanted to get rid of to make room for incoming stuff. CONUS only, **prices include shipping**. If purchased soon, I should be able to ship sometime tomorrow.

**Devastating TKL:**

A-Stock in the Grey variant. Built with 0305 Mill-Max Sockets.

This arrived a couple of weeks ago, but I only built it over the weekend. While installing the mill-max sockets, I lifted the pad for the W-key and stripped its trace, so had to bridge (photos included in album). Regardless of how scuffed it looks, the PCB works fine. Comes with everything it originally came with, including 2 FR4 plates, o-rings, polyfill etc.

Asking $380 shipped in original bag / packaging

**NK Cherry BoW:**

Purchased this from another user just last week, but upgraded with KAT Alpha. 0 shine, original owner cleaned it with denture tablets. Missing 1 out of the 4 PGDN keys.

Asking $55 shipped in bags, +$10 shipped in original trays

**x60 Sakurios:**

Also purchased these from another user, mounted once in a hotswap board. Lubed with 205g0, springs with 105, never soldered. These are also 3-pin, as the previous owner clipped the legs.

Asking $60 shipped

No rattles on stabs now. Used for less than 5 hours. Want to let go because the board is still a little too big for my tiny work desk.

Downsizing my collection. Brand new or used, I'm the first and only owner. Condition is clearly stated with close-up photos in timestamp to show condition. All items come with **original and full packaging just like when newly shipped,** unless otherwise stated.

Payment: All through Paypal Goods and Services for your peace of mind as it comes with buyer's protection, unless you specifically request other methods otherwise.

I ship globally to your residential country or to your Singapore forwarder address (I'm based in Singapore), shipping estimate:

1. Shipping to your Singapore forwarder address, less than 7 USD;
2. Shipping to your residential country:

a. Standard shipping (selective countries only) - **7-15 USD** for smaller items, **12-35 USD** for bigger items.

b. Express shipping - **25 USD onwards**; keyboard will be usually 50 **USD onwards (shiping within Asia will be cheaper)**. For goods value above 300 USD, I will only recommend to ship with Express option given faster turnaround and better point-to-point tracking. Combine multiple purchases to save on shipping as there's always a base weight charged.

* Two disclaimers:
   * Both included plates do not work with stepped caps lock well because the switch cutout stops short a little bit. If you would like to use stepped caps lock you need to file the plates slightly. Alternatively, you can just use a different plate.
   * The typing angle (4 degrees) is pretty low. According to some people, this is fantastic and better than a higher angle. For me, I've decided that it is not. I have done some testing with other low angle boards over the past couple weeks and decided I like the higher angle. It comes down to personal preference, but I thought it was worth mentioning.

Heyo mm,

I like to lube/film switches in my free time/as I watch shows as it is therapeutic and helps pass the time (plus the bonus of getting to physically feel and hear the switch, so lmk if you want an honest review before you buy). I want to provide modded switches at an affordable price but can be flexible. My pricing is typically the MSRP of the switch + $.30 for lubing and $.05 for adding film. Shipping is additional at $4 for CONUS.

Also have a BNIB GMK VoC lying around.

Local is 92618 and 92843.

Hi folks, I've recently built another TKL so I'll need to sell this one off since it's not getting much use. It's a near-flawless condition KBD8xmkii built with 62g lubed+filmed mauves+sohos on a PC plate (they're identical JWK switches, just didn't have enough of either to cover the whole keyboard. Typing experience is also unaffected).

There's a tiny hairline scratch on the brass weight that I've included pictures of, but this seems to be a pretty common occurrence.

The typing experience is surprisingly soft because the PC plate has a solid amount of flex. Sound is also pretty nice and thocky due to the top mount, but it's not harsh at all. Case foam can be included if you want to dampen any reverb or reduce some thock.

* Built KBD8xmkii: 380 shipped
* Extra plates: 40 shipped for the brass, 30 shipped for each of the FR4/PC plate
* Extra case foam + desoldered PCB (tested): 80 shipped
* **Bundle everything together (strongly preferred!): 450 shipped**

I'm not making any money here, just want to sell off this bundle for cheap to someone who will get some great use out of it :)

The keyboard is lightly used. I don't see any noticeable scuffs on the exterior but there is some scuffs on the plate due to removing switches which is normal (you can also see for yourself on pictures provided). Shipping to CONUS only sorry. Would like to sell everything as a whole so naturally priority goes to bundles. Willing to give price adjustments for bundles.

Cleaning up my collection a bit, and found these two boards from 2016/2017, both of which have interesting histories.

**Exclusive's first board:** [the E8-V1](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=87572.0).  I am selling an **unbuilt WKL Founders Edition, #33** (of 33), **MAO white**, with raw brass weight, two plates (red alu, steel), one PCB, a bunch of badges in different colors.   

*Like the other E8-V1s, I have observed alignment issues where the WKL blockers touch the keycaps above them (only tested the steel plate). This can be remedied for the most part by pushing the plate up up up when screwing it into the top case. Otherwise this is a really nice, chunky, and limited board.  I went through a lot to get this board with all parts working, and it has left me with somewhat of a bitter taste that I can't get rid off (The GB for this was a real mess, to say the least, check the GH thread above for full history). Hence me selling it.*  

Looking for **~~$400 OBO~~ SOLD for asking**.

**Feng's** [**Smart 68 V1**](https://web.archive.org/web/20180703134842/https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=83442.0) (not to be confused with the Magicforce 68 Smart). One of the first custom keyboards that came with hotswap sockets. I am selling a Silver V1 (low profile) with a red plate. Layout B (which is rather unconventional).  

*Similarly to the E8-V1, the GB was pretty awful. Feng/Geekkeys were super unresponsive and some people never got their board after all. I was lucky and got all the ones I ordered (I am keeping a black one for myself). It's actually quite a nice low-profile board. Almost not bezel to it. Here a* [*few photos with SA keycaps*](https://imgur.com/a/p3Nmm) *but it also looks quite good with GMK. Stabs need to be relubed.*

~~Lubrigante Case – Acrylic Case in matte clear acrylic.  Ordered from Ponoko in January 2021 and quickly moved onto designing my own custom stacked case so I no longer need this one.  You can pick up a pcb from switch couture, sneakbox, or project keyboard who have theirs on preorder.   I ordered an extra acrylic spacers to accommodate top and bottom mount usb C.  One of the additional spacers has a crack in it but has been repaired.  (If you have a pcb topside usbc you wont need this piece). The rest of the acrylic is in excellent shape as it was used as a model.  Hardware included is brass stand off and m2 hex sockets.  Skip the wait time and trying to find hardware.  With all pieces the case is 18mm.  Stack height is 7.5mm part a (hi profile no gap), 3mm part B plate, part c and d 8mm, and 2mm part E.  I do have aluminum feet if you need them it’s an extra 10$.~~

~~Lubrigante Case – Acrylic Case in matte clear acrylic.  Ordered from Ponoko in January 2021 and quickly moved onto designing my own custom stacked case so I no longer need this one.  You can pick up a pcb from switch couture, sneakbox, or project keyboard who have theirs on preorder.   I ordered an extra acrylic spacers to accommodate top and bottom mount usb C.  One of the additional spacers has a crack in it but has been repaired.  (If you have a pcb topside usbc you wont need this piece). The rest of the acrylic is in excellent shape as it was used as a model.  Hardware included is brass stand off and m2 hex sockets.  Skip the wait time and trying to find hardware.  With all pieces the case is 18mm.  Stack height is 7.5mm part a (hi profile no gap), 3mm part B plate, part c and d 8mm, and 2mm part E.

A quick note for the pricing: for the boards, I'm trying my best to price them at break-even, which means the prices only cover my costs (the board, switches and mods, stabs, shipping fee to me and PayPal fee). For keycap sets, they are priced at market average.

**Bocc Polycarbonate** | Includes Soldered (never used) and Hotswap PCB (used for a few weeks), original box and accessories. **LEDs on the Hotswap PCB, the 4 on the bottom left do not turn on.** **Also, screwing in the hotswap PCB to the case is not possible in this instance, its a known issue with the polycarb version of this board. Seems the threads werent created properly.**** This hasnt been an issue for me as the switches are held in with friction easily, and soldered will be soldered in obviously.** The brass weights have a couple scuffs but nothing major. Used the board for a few weeks and love it, but not a fan of the weight of a polycarb board. Hoping to get a Zentith when its out.  | **$590 shipped**

Some notes on the items:

\- **Zebra Wood 60%** \- Has DZ60RGB PCB. Came built by KBDFans with lubed stabs and factory Zealios. Comes with wrist rest. I'm willing to desolder and take off $50 but priority goes to anyone who wants it with switches.

\- **GMK Botanical RAMA** \- This is the white version. Opened but used very very lightly.

\- **GMK Botanical Space Cable** \- Has definitely seen better days but is not in horrible condition. See photos.

\- **Nullbits Nibble** \- Unbuilt.

\- **Mechlovin Adelais PCB & FR4** \- This is their first iteration with USB-mini top mount. Will only sell these together as they're already priced low.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or would like more pictures :)

The price is as listed below or best offer, and the shipping fee depends on the location - might be waived if you're close enough to Philly.

Feel free to PM me for details. Thanks!

A quick note for the pricing: for the boards, I'm trying my best to price them at break-even, which means the prices only cover my costs (the board, switches and mods, stabs, shipping fee to me and PayPal fee). For keycap sets, they are priced at market average.

Hey y'all,

Today what I have for sale is a custom vintage build.

It's a very clean Wyse ASCII keyboard (no yellowing and minor shine on the keycaps), that's been USB converted internally, and is fully functional.

Additionally, the switches have been replaced with NovelKeys Novelias, which are similar to Box Royals but pink and with a different weighted spring, and the stabilizers have been lubed.

Currently, the converter tries to map the keys one-to-one with what's written on the keycaps, but it's possible to reprogram it with a different layout.

Additionally,  the  switches have been replaced with NovelKeys Novelias, which are  similar  to Box Royals but pink and with a different weighted spring, and  the  stabilizers have been lubed.

Currently,   the converter tries to map the keys one-to-one with what's written on   the keycaps, but it's possible to reprogram it with a different layout.

Looking for $140 OBO.

It is the hotswappable PCB.  Comes with c3 stabs (lilac body, n9 grey stem) lubed with that one dbz lube and 205g0.

I have lubed and clipped the stabilizers. Will come in original carrying case with original cable, the rest of the mitocorn caps will be in a bag.

Hello,

Trying to do some spring cleaning of some things I am just not going to use anymore. Please comment before PM. I am only shipping to CONUS right now (sorry). If you have any questions feel free to ask. I tried to price everything at or below what I have seen these items sell for recently on here but if something seems off please let me know. Items will be marked out once sold. Thanks!!

**~~Rama M65-B Milk~~**~~: Has hotswap PCB. Keyboard has been built once. I typed on it for around 5 minutes and then unbuilt the board. The board is in perfect condition. This will come with everything you would receive from Rama as well as it having the internal weight installed in the board already. Does not include stabs, switches or keycaps. Will ship this in original box as well. ----~~ ***~~Asking $950 shipped OBO~~*** SOLD FOR $900 SHIPPED

**~~GMK White on Black~~**~~: Picked this up from Drop a few months ago but what I planned on using it for is getting a different set. Set is up for pre order on Drop right now but if you don't want to wait to get the set then here is this one. ----~~ ***~~Asking $150 shipped OBO~~*** SOLD FOR ASKING PRICE

**~~GMK Oblivion v2~~**~~: I believe this is the regular base kit as it has the Hello World! enter key but the previous owner was not for sure. This set does have a good amount of shine on the WASD keys plus others that are used for gaming. The rest of the caps have shine but it is not quite as bad. Pricing will reflect this as well. This will be shipped in bags. ----~~ ***~~Asking $220 shipped OBO~~*** SOLD FOR $200 SHIPPED

**~~PBT Islander~~**~~: Bought this base set for the Rama above but as you can see I will not (hopefully) have that board in my possession too much longer. I mounted this set once, typed on it for maybe 5 minutes and then took it off and put it back in the box. Set looks brand new, no shine at all. Will ship this in the original box. ----~~ ***~~Asking $120 shipped OBO~~*** SOLD FOR ASKING",bought gmk wob from u/ajttwood,"[US-IL] [H] Rama M65-B Milk, GMK WoB, GMK Oblivion v2, PBT Islander Base [W] PayPal"

**~~GMK 8008 Base and Accent Kits~~**

***SOLD for asking*** *~~$300 shipped~~*

Includes base kit and accent kit. The caps are lightly used, but there is no shine or signs of use. Will ship in original GMK tray and sleeve.

&#x200B;

**~~Monstargear PC XO v2~~**

SOLD for $350 *~~$375 shipped (no keycaps or switches included)~~*

Limited edition polycarbonate hotswap TKL from Monstargear with brass plate, brass weight, and RGB lighting. This is a really solid and heavy board. The PVD brass weight and plate give it some real bulk, and it sounds great with tactiles and linears. RGB accent lighting on the side as well as under each key. Stock plate mounted stabs were replaced with genuine Cherry stabilizers and Durock purple stems, lubed with 205g0. Connects via USB-C.

&#x200B;

**~~ALF X1.1 WKL Grey~~**

SOLD for $375 *~~$400 shipped (no keycaps or switches included)~~*

This is an incredibly heavy board anodized in a deep gray with brass plate and weight. I’ve installed mill-max sockets to make the PCB hotswappable. The PVD brass weight and plate are tarnished (see photos), but this does not affect the board’s performance in any way. There is an extra plate and weight in a highly reflective, steel-like PVD finish. I’m not 100% sure if it’s brass, but both are in very good condition.

The PCB is QMK-compatible and connects via USB-C. Please note that the LEDs beneath the ALF logo do not seem to work. The previous seller informed me that they should, but I could never figure it out. They may still work, but assume that they do not.

&#x200B;

**~~KBD 8X MKII WKL Rose Gold + PC Plate and Gummy Worm Gasket~~**

SOLD for $375 *~~$400 shipped (no keycaps or switches included)~~*

Aluminum 8X MKII WKL in rose gold. The PCB has been mill-maxed, making it hotswap. It will come with lubed smokey Durock screw-in stabs. The board’s in like-new condition, with no signs of wear on the ano, brass weight, brass plate, etc.

I’ll also include a polycarbonate plate and a gummy worm gasket, both of which (in my opinion) help this board really shine.

&#x200B;

**PBT Olivia Japanese**

*$50 shipped, +$40 with any keyboard*

Bought this set off of Taobao some time ago. Colors are really nice and, despite being a bit thin, the dye sub of the legends and symbols is pretty good. The PBT is thick and sturdy. Only selling this because I use WKL boards, and this set does NOT support Tsangan or WKL bottom rows.

&#x200B;

**PBT Camping**

*$40 shipped, +$25 with any keyboard*

PBT dye-sub version of GMK Camping. Compatible with standard TKL and 60/65% boards. Do not expect GMK-like quality, as the dye sub legends are not quite as crisp. Colors are also brighter than the original.",bought gmk 8008 from /u/itsamemarius,[US-IL] [H] GMK 8008 | KBD 8XMKII Rose Gold | Alf X1.1 | Monstargear PC XO v2 TKL | PBT Keycaps [W] PayPal

Looking to trade this Space65 for a Vega thats hotswap,or a unbuilt Hotswap voice65 just pm me the board specs and colorway etc. (I will be keeping this GMK set unless you are trading one as well). 

This board is in flawless condition, I can make a sound test upon request along with other pictures. 

-Built on a Carbon Fiber plate, with Lubed and filmed alpacas, as well as durock v2 stabs. 

-Pink LED Badge

-Will ship in original packaging

-IMO the stabs could be redone, I purchased this off MM and it was built by a streamer and the space bar could use a little bit of work. However, I am pretty picky when it comes to how the board sounds, so that may just be me. It is not quite my taste as I would rather have a more deep and thocky sound. 


I will also trade for other 65% boards, pm me with colorway, condition, or anything that is worthy of mentioning.

I would love to sell this board as a bundle but we’ll see what offers I get! Anyways the board is built with lubed and filmed JWK Moss switches and Smokey Durock Stabs. It currently has a FR4 Plate, but it came with brass. The keycaps are NK BoW. **DOES NOT COME WITH CABLE**

I’m going to ask $425 for the whole board including everything listed but if would want to bargain, just pm I’m open to dropping the price a little bit.

PC HHKB Leaf60 | ~~$350 local, $375 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Built with Gat Black Inks, PC plate, Zeal stabs, and black back weight. I bought this one off [this nice person](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/kk0l7j/kr_h_leaf60_hhkb_rama_heavy_industry_seq2_w_paypal/) from Korea and it is beautiful but I've moved onto something different. I was forgot to take photos myself but if you check their timestamps, you can find a crack on the inside of the top housing, which isn't noticeable when built/in use. Will come in box with extra top housing. Pictured in **new timestamp** with the PBT WoB keycaps, not included in price but will include for $50.
HHKB Classic Charcoal | ~~$200 local, $220 shipped~~ **pending** | Bought from someone here. Sliders are very lightly lubed with 3204 but could probably do with a more thorough brush over. Will come in original box, original black spacebar, blue & red PBT spacebars, and RAMA cable as I don't have the original.
[GMK Laser R1](https://imgur.com/rNeCyzp) | ~~$375 local, $400 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Base, gaijin, spacebar, and blocknet kits. These were my daily driver for a little under a month so they have been used but there is little to no shine, not that I could find at least. Price is for base kit shipped in GMK tray and the rest in bags.
GMK Peach Blossom | ~~$220 local, $230 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Bought this set sealed from someone local, used and mounted for less than an hour. I actually sold this to somebody in an older post but unbeknownst to me, two keycaps were missing but were eventually found but the person ended up just returning the set. Box is banged up on one corner but trays are in still in good condition.
GMK Penumbra | ~~$115 local, $130 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Bought from someone local, in bags, as is. There is some shine on some random keys that I tried my best to capture, again, if you scroll down [this timestamp](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/lll49u/usca_h_kuro_m60a_pc_hhkb_leaf60_ewhite_hhkb/).
[Alcatel MMK Doubleshots](https://imgur.com/NIfimo1) | ~~$50 local, $60 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Forgot who I bought these from but these are doubleshot keycaps from an [Alcatel MMK](https://deskthority.net/wiki/images/thumb/a/a0/Alcatel_004.jpg/640px-Alcatel_004.jpg) -- what you see is what you get. Bought these to use for a display board but would prefer they just go to a good home. Shipped in bag.
Laser aviator cable | $40 local, $50 shipped | **The one with the blue heatshrinks.** Bought to go with ePBT Sushi and I thought it went really well together since it has blue connectors and is a lighter shade than other Laser-themed cables.
Laser YC-8 cable | $50 local, $60 shipped | **The one with the purple heatshrinks.** Bought from u/ThePrinkus, one of the nicer cables I've had the pleasure of trying. I paired this with the Laser R1 set and this shade works really well but just going another direction.

Hi friends,

Hope the new year has been treating you all well. I've had a lot of fun buying, selling, and trading over the past year but I've been in and around this hobby for too long and I need the money more than I need the keyboards so I'm looking to shed all of the paperweights I've accrued.

**I will begin shipping things some time either before or after this weekend but right now, due to my work schedule and being unable to get to the post office while they are open, I am prioritizing and only listening to local offers.** Bundles get priority over single item buyers. Prices are for pick up local to Los Angeles (90006) but I'm alright with meeting up if you are farther from greater LA, though I might ask for a few extra bucks cause gas is expensive again, man.

The three keyboards listed are priced to sell barebones (i.e. unbuilt with no switches). If you'd like to bundle something, message me what you'd like and we can talk it out. I also have extra switches and stabilizers which are not listed so feel free to ask and I can let you know what I have.

**If you happen to have an e-black HHKB Leaf60, I am happy to trade or buy straight up. I'm also open to a black HHKB Polaris.**

Please comment before PM, I'll pass on messages until you comment in the thread. I also have chat disabled so PM is your best friend.

I am currently using this keyboard and have it listed in case there is someone who is willing to buy it ASAP, I just want what I paid for it. No stabs included, unless buyer asks.

I was forgot to take photos myself but if you check their timestamps, you will see photos of the brass back weight and a crack on the inside of the top housing, which isn't noticeable when built/in use.

I would prefer to keep the JTK keycap trays but if the buyer wants them both, they can have them for an extra $15. *Anyone can buy the trays, they are FCFS.*
[GMK Striker](https://imgur.com/6mefhvL) | ~~$225~~ **Sold!** | I forgot who I bought these from and was too lazy to look it up. To be honest, I overpaid for them but eh, it was a cool set to own. Heavy shine from the previous owner, photos with and without light in larger timestamp. I'm not sure how to price this seeing as Striker 2 is in group buy, this comes with no box, and it is heavily used so feel free to send offers but I feel like this is fair if you don't want to wait until Q4 2021/Q1 2022 for the group buy.
GMK Peach Blossom | ~~$220~~ **Sold!** | Bought this set sealed from someone local, used and mounted for less than an hour. Beautiful set but just don't have any use for it. Box is banged up on one corner but trays are in still in good condition. Just asking what I paid for it.
GMK Penumbra | $150 | Also bought from someone local, in bags, as is. There is some shine on some random keys that I tried my best to capture, again, if you scroll down the larger timestamp. No tray but, if you want the JTK keycap trays shown in the GMK Laser timestamp, you can have them for $15. *Trays are FCFS.*
[Alcatel MMK Doubleshots](https://imgur.com/NIfimo1) | $75 | Forgot who I bought these from but these are doubeshot keycaps from an [Alcatel MMK](https://deskthority.net/wiki/images/thumb/a/a0/Alcatel_004.jpg/640px-Alcatel_004.jpg) -- what you see is what you get. Bought these to use for a display board but would prefer they just go to a good home.
enjoyPBT Sushi (White) | $100 | Used for about a month but have been in a bag ever since.
70x MX Hyperglides | $70 | Lubed and filmed by previous owner, not sure with though.
70x Penguins | $45 | 205g0 on housing and rails but not the legs, GPL 105 for the springs, white Deskey films. Lubed and filmed by previous owner. Will come in Kinetic Labs bag.
[Dark blue aviator cable](https://imgur.com/L9Trk3o) | ~~$40~~ **Sold!** | Bought off someone locally just to have a matching cable for Striker. The cable is a tad bit darker but I like how it looked together, especially if you have a darker deskmat or desk setup in general.
[White YC-8 cable](https://imgur.com/ADQvXCU) | ~~$60~~ **Sold!** | I bought this cable in case I went with a white board in the future but don't think I'll be going that route for the foreseeable future.
[Laser aviator cable](https://imgur.com/9psCGCB), *left in timestamp* | $50 | Bought to go with ePBT Sushi and I thought it went really well together since it has blue connectors and is a lighter shade than other Laser-themed cables.

Hello again friends,

Continuing my journey towards keyboard minimalism and, generally, not hoarding stuff. **Local to Los Angeles, 90006.** I'm happy to talk more about stuff in DMs or provide photos of specific things upon request.

~~£200,~~ £150 for the full set (sans numpad), which is about what I paid for them all up (shipping & tax). Not interested in splitting the sets at all. Just checked the invoice, I paid $230 USD all up.

This pcb also has a reset button that does not line up with the hole on the backplate meant for said button. I built this board with one of the acrylic strips meant for raising it, in between the pcb and the backplate to prevent the button from being constantly pressed. You can see what I mean in the timestamp as well. You can desolder the reset button, drill a new hole in the back plate to solve this issue, or keep the build as I had done it.

Hi all,

&nbsp;

Didn't sell this the last time and totally forgot about it. Up for sale again is a bundle for GMK Camping(japan) base + novelties from round 2. Both kits are 100% sealed. I'm guessing this is the last round so might be one of the fewer chances left at a sealed set if that is your preference.

&nbsp;

IMO one of the best themed sets out there but went a different direction for a build. Selling as a bundle only.

Clearing out some stuff that doesn't get desk time anymore. CONUS only, not FCFS. Bundles will be prioritized.

**KFE R1** \- First up is a silver KFE from R1 - [https://monokei.co/products/kfe](https://monokei.co/products/kfe). Condition is good. There is one small nick next to the arrow keys that I have pictured in the timestamp. This will come with an infinity ce PCB built with vintage blacks (58.5g thicthoc) with C3 stabs on a full poly plate. This is the build that I purchased it with from the original owner and I have not taken it apart since I purchased it. I will also be selling this with a brand new unopened h88 and a half fr4 plate. **Looking for $900 shipped.**

**~~Navy WKL Prophet~~** ~~- Prophet is in perfect condition, I don't see any flaws to speak of. I have only used it a few times since it was sent to me. Anything you see in the picture is just dust particles or smudges on the bottom. Top is navy, bottom is black. This will ship unbuilt with a brand new, unused prophet pcb and PP and nylon plates.~~ **~~Looking for $530 shipped.~~**

**~~Singa Jaguar, B stock -~~** ~~This board has essentially never been used. I built it up and never got to type on it because the left shift on the PCB did not work. I wasn't able to return this as I bought it unopened from the first owner. They sold it as new. So unfortunately this is a plate and pcb with no working left shift. The flaw to make it B stock is on the inside. Happy to send a picture if needed.~~ **~~Looking for $950 shipped. SOLD FOR $925~~**

**~~NK65 Milkshake~~** ~~- Just got this in, brand new -~~ **~~$265 shipped SOLD~~**

**~~GMK Metaverse Base Kit -~~** ~~Lightly used. Minimal shine at most. -~~ **~~$270 shipped SOLD~~**

Looking to move on from my GMK oblivion set that was used on my work keyboard but no longer need, since it was used daily there is some shine on the alphas hopefully the pictures can show it accurately. Also have a TOFU 65 board I built to use while I waited for my main board to come in. Used for a few months, flaws in it are the screws that hold are gold weight are stripped so you wont be able to take off the weight under the board. Another flaw is in the pcb , for some reason my alt and windows key are flipped even though I have them mapped correctly in QMK, as a work around I simply mapped them oppositely in QMK. Same thing happens for the backspace key as well as the '\\' key, used the same fix and mapped them oppositely. Never tried to get a refund or get it fixed since this was an easy workaround.

Note that the black Windows keys are pad printed. All other keys are double shot.

Also including the dark gray double shot windows keys shown, which were made by JTK - I got those out of a JTK grab bag.

These were made by Cherry, on the same tooling that is now owned by GMK (Cherry sold their double shot tooling to GMK around 2011 or 2012).

Note that the white on OG Cherry double shot WoB is a bit creamier and more beige - seems to be somewhere between CP and L9.

|104-key OG Cherry WoB double shot set - see below for detailed description.|Very light shine on the alphas. No shine on the other keys. The 6.25u spacebar is brand new (came from GMK Bleached's spacebar kit.). Will be sold in bags.|$75 + shipping|

Local is 02459.

**OG Cherry WoB**

Includes only the keys shown. This will fit a typical 104-key full-size, TKL, or 60% with standard winkey bottom row. Only including the non-stepped Caps Lock only. The alphas cluster keys came from a Cherry G80-8200HUAUS-2, and the nav keys, F-keys, and numpad are from a G81-8000HPBUS-2-C. The spacebar is from GMK Bleached's spacebar kit.

Note that the black Windows keys are pad printed. All other keys are double shot.

Also including the dark gray double shot windows keys shown, which were made by JTK - I got those out of a JTK grab bag.

These were made by Cherry, on the same tooling that is now owned by GMK (Cherry sold their double shot tooling to GMK around 2011 or 2012).

Note that the white on OG Cherry double shot WoB is a bit creamier and more beige than GMK WoB - seems to be pretty close to GMK L9 (see pic), which is the beige used on 9009.

625,edwyn,1613544854.0,/r/mechmarket/comments/lloc0n/ic_gmk_95neon_set_based_on_airmax_95_for_fellow/,"/MM Community, I'm Edwyn and GMK 95NEON is my first keyset. This set is inspired by one of my favorite sneakers in its original (and best?) colorway: Nike Air Max 95 in Neon.

After the success of the shoe, the Neon colorway, also known as volt, is now one of the most popular colorways in sports and I want to bring it to the keyboard community.

Just like when it was created in the 90s, the Neon colorway evokes a sense of the future and speed, something that I feel matcheswith the keyboard niche. It was a challenge to faithfully replicate the shoe into a keycap set as the NEON colorway itself has gonethrough many tweaks of its own during its 25+ year lifetime and capturing the grey gradient was also not easy.

I hope my my rendition does the shoe justice and delights fellow sneakerheads and 90s kids. If you are interested please fill in the IC form

~~**GMK Botanical Base:** Sealed. **Looking for $325 shipped**~~ **SOLD**

~~**SKCM Salmon Alps:** 62 salmon alps + 1 SKCM lock switch.  These...are not in the best condition. Had to give them the full restoration treatment: Ultrasonic cleaning the top housing and sliders, and then dry lubing them the top housing and sliders, as well as paper-modding them. They feel OK in the end. Tested switches are on multimeter where 43 are in working condition while 19 others are not. I'm sure you could get the 19 others to work by bending the leaf spring on the switchplate back. Condition based on key feel alone ranges wildly from 4.5-6/10. Could haggle a bit lower pricing if you feel like it. **Looking for $35 shipped**~~ **SOLD**

**Apple Portable Alps Keycaps:** [Full layout](https://i.imgur.com/ZMHnII9.jpg) You'll find that these looking strikingly like those from the alpha portion of a M0116, meaning that the right hand mods are all 0.5U shorter than traditional 60% layouts (1.5U backspace, 1.75 enter, 2.25 shift).

Flawless condition. Comes with a desoldering PKB PCB, aluminum plate, PC plate, and LEDs/hardware. Replaced the stock case screws with the black hex screws that were included (with the exception of 2 holes that were a bit tight for the hex, so I left them with the stock screws as I didn’t want to risk stripping them). Shipped in PCK carry case.~~

~~**HHKB Professional Classic - $190 shipped**
(White/Printed, Manufacturing date July 2020)
Basically new, only used for a few typing tests to compare with my Type-S as this was originally meant to be a donor board for other projects.~~

**MIssing “up arrow”** 
Bone base used for &lt;5 hours, Rolling bones and UMKA are unused. No shine or loss of texture. One of my most prized sets because of the R0 and R5, unfortunately missing the “up arrow” which could be somewhat replaced with the 1u shift key. Shipped in bags.

~~**GMK Hyperfuse (2016) - $180 shipped**

The 87x kit, cut appropriately to outfit a 86u but found it slightly too light.~~

All 4 of the GMK Sumi deskmats, unused. I only have one box that is long enough for these so I’d prefer to sell them in a single bundle.~~

KINGBOARDS FOR SALE!!!

Off loading some extra stuff of mine. Getting deep into this hobby, I cannot justify having 6 different boards in my current situation.

Please let me know if you have any questions. I prefer bundles and selling CONUS. Shipping for switches is approximately $5, I am unsure about the boards, but I estimate about +$13.

Hello! Today I have some deals. I got a little too excited recently and am looking to off-load some things.

**Monokei Kei - $675 shipped OBO**

[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/t6t9Ozm)

Silver with red bottom, HHKB, A - Stock, Polcarb plate, solderable PCB, built. I’m not looking to de-solder. I don't have the instruction card / art for this board.

There is a small scratch on the left blocker, and a very very small mark on the right side of the board, see photos. Both marks are very minor in my opinion, but you can judge for yourself.

Built with Tealios V2, turquoise, 65g. Switches have been lubed with Krytox 205 G0 and filmed with Deskeys switch films. Stabs are Durock V2, color smokey, lubed with Krytox 205 G0, landing pads on the pcb.

Make me an offer!

**SOLD** **~~Resin Party Artisan - $30 shipped~~**

[~~Photos~~](https://imgur.com/a/7G17W7G)

~~Mounted once, never used. Cherry profile R1 (Esc). Pretty colors.~~

**SOLD** **~~Infinikey BOW - $115 shipped in bags~~**

~~Complete set, used very sparingly, no shine.~~

**SOLD** **~~GMK Minimal Base - $125 OBO shipped in bags~~**

[~~Photos~~](https://imgur.com/a/QKNqm6N)

~~Q: Wait, what the hell? Why is this GMK Minimal set so cheap? Why is it OBO?~~

~~A: Well….~~

~~I purchased this set used, for… well… more than this. It came with some shine. A bit more than I expected but oh well, not a huge deal. I thought, “I can shine these fully so that they’re even and look nicer”. This idea was fine, I was slowly shining them by hand. Then I got impatient. I used a dremel with a soft wheel on it and some plastic shine compound to speed up the process. Unfortunately the friction was hard to control and I ended up deforming a few caps. Theyre not tooooo bad, but some keys, like the 7u spacebar and return keys have marks where the top layer of plastic is a bit deformed and other keys like the O key have corners that are basically worn down. I’ve included photos so you can see for yourself. I know, I know, I fucked up. I also don’t have any idea how to price this set now. Hence the OBO. Don’t get offended if you think my price is way to high for a~~ *~~damaged~~* ~~set like this, just low ball me.~~

###Switch Lubing/Modding Service
[Work Station & Example of Lubing — 20,000+ switches lubed](https://imgur.com/a/HreuCIa)   

| `Service` | `Pricing` |
| :- | :-: |
| `Switch Lubing` | **$0.50^(/switch)** — **$0.60^(/switch)** my lube |
| `Frankenswitch Lubing` | **$0.65^(/switch)** — **$0.75^(/switch)** my lube |
| `Switch Filming` | **$0.10^(/film)** — **$0.15^(/film)** my film | 
| `Spring Swapping` | **$0.10^(/spring)** | 
| `Stabilizer Tuning/Lubing` | **$2.00^(/stabilizer)** |

###How It Works
1) [Fill out the order form](https://forms.gle/AyBtXJiaLHn66CVWA)
2) You ship your things to me
> Buyer covers shipping both ways

3) I complete your order, send an invoice, and ship everything back
> Everything will be shipped back in the same packaging
---
###FAQ
1. Which parts of the switch do I lube?  
> Bottom housing, stem (tactile legs aren't lubed), and spring   
>
> ***Disclaimer: Unless otherwise stated, factory lube is not removed*** 

2. What is 205g2+105 and how does it compare to 205g0?    
>  205g2+105 is a 1:1 mixture of 205g2 and 105 commonly used among Korean keyboard enthusiasts, popular Youtuber [:3ildcat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeHOkFGW-7uAZFvq3BXb8YA), and sold by [TX Keyboards](https://www.us.txkeyboards.com/products/krytox-lube?variant=31403083825212). The result is a mixture with a consistency very similar to 205g0, which is a mixture of 105 and PTFE powder.

3. What is your turnaround time?
> 1-3 days depending on when I receive your switches and/or materials

4. Switch sales cannot be confirmed for trade flair

#Switch Lubing/Modding Service
[Work Station & Example of Lubing — 20,000+ switches lubed](https://imgur.com/a/HreuCIa)   

| `Service` | `Pricing` |
| :- | :-: |
| `Switch Lubing` | **$0.50^(/switch)** — **$0.60^(/switch)** my lube |
| `Frankenswitch Lubing` | **$0.65^(/switch)** — **$0.75^(/switch)** my lube |
| `Switch Filming` | **$0.10^(/film)** — **$0.15^(/film)** my film | 
| `Spring Swapping` | **$0.10^(/spring)** | 
| `Stabilizer Tuning/Lubing` | **$2.00^(/stabilizer)** |

###How It Works
1) [Fill out the order form](https://forms.gle/AyBtXJiaLHn66CVWA)
2) You ship your things to me
> Buyer covers shipping both ways

3) I complete your order, send an invoice, and ship everything back
> Everything will be shipped back in the same packaging
---
#FAQ
1. Which parts of the switch do I lube?  
> Bottom housing (rails, center post, bottom)  
> Stem (all sides and legs) - tactile legs aren't lubed   
> ***Disclaimer: Unless otherwise stated, factory lube is not removed*** 
>
> All switches are lubed and filmed the following materials:  
> — Krytox 205g2+105: bottom housing and stem  
> — Krytox 105: springs  
> — TX Film: 0.15mm & 0.125mm

2. What is 205g2+105 and how does it compare to 205g0?    
>  205g2+105 is a 1:1 mixture of 205g2 and 105 commonly used among Korean keyboard enthusiasts, popular Youtuber [:3ildcat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeHOkFGW-7uAZFvq3BXb8YA), and sold by [TX Keyboards](https://www.us.txkeyboards.com/products/krytox-lube?variant=31403083825212). The result is a mixture with a consistency very similar to 205g0, which is a mixture of 105 and PTFE powder.

3. What is your turnaround time?
> 1-3 days depending on when I receive your switches and/or materials

4. Switch sales cannot be confirmed for trade flair

Hi MM,

The time has come for me to release one of my fav boards.

The board is cerakoted with combat grey top and rose gold bottom/badge. Original color was graphite for those who are wondering.

There are 2 builds for the board:

1. Gat inks lubed with 205g0 on brass plate <- current
2. Holy mint pandas lubed with 3204 on copper plate

Board has 2 badges

1. copper
2. rose gold

there is one small mark on the brass weight but its hard to see unless under harsh lighting

I am taking priority over local(94568)>US>NA>World

Asking is 2,200$ obo shipped US (will recalculate if outside of US)

After 2 years in the hobby I've collected a lot of stuff that I intended to use but because I was busy I never got to it. Now it's just piled up and I think it's time it goes to someone who can use it and free up some funds. I'm also moving in a few months so it was an opportune time to downsize the collection.

Hey-hey. It is a time for a spring cleaning! I have some things I'd like to let go off, but before that a couple of things to mention:

* All prices exclude shipping and are OBO (meaning you can offer your __lower__ price by sending me a message here on Reddit)
* For switches / springs that miss like 1-4 pics that you need (i.e. you need 63 and I offer 60) I can throw in the extra ones you need (will need to check in my extras stash though).
* Please don't use Reddit Chat. I rarely check it when I'm on the go in my 9 square meters room ;)
* Bundles take priority. EU takes priority for singular items. I ship pretty much everywhere but do ask just in case.
* The minimum total I'm willing to ship outside EU is 50€
* Trades are possible but won't be prioritised (unless you have GMK Phosphorous or Prophet HHKB)

With all of the above out of the way, the menu is below!

Hey-hey. So I'm looking to trade my Wilba Thermal Moon for a different 60% HHKB layout keyboard.

What I Have:

* Wilba Thermal Seq1 (Moon)
* Kit polished aluminium plate
* Extra kuro (black) plate
* Kit hotswap PCB
* Extra solderable PCB
* Paperwork, original packaging, box etc.

I've built this board with a hotswap PCB and used for the last \~7 days (even less). No visual imperfections whatsoever.

Reason for trading: ""Moon"" colour is almost impossible to colour match with the keysets I have. It has this peculiar bluish tint which I'm not particularly a fan of.

What I'm looking for:

* 60% HHKB layout keyboards only
* No integrated plate / sandwich mount please
* Trade for Wilba Thermal in a different colour is also an option

**I'm not looking to sell the board at this time so please don't even ask.**

~~High polished set of SA Pulse keycaps. These took me hours to polish first using super fine micromesh followed by a dual action polisher with compound then with fine polish. Never again will I do this, lubing switches is much faster to put it in perspective haha. They look way cooler than stock SA caps but I can’t get used to typing on SA despite the cool looks and fun loud sound. They are not flawless, let’s be very clear about that, they have been used since polishing so they have typical swirl mark style super fine micro scratches on them which is impossible to avoid since you’re constantly touching them. They will ship in plastic bags so they may pick up a few more tiny marks during shipping, nothing I can do about that really. The only caps that are polished are the standard 60% ANSI caps, mod-pipe and tilde. All the F row, arrows and other caps above the main set shown in the pictures are not polished and have the factory matte finish still. $120 shipped via priority mail~~ SOLD!

Hello, I am looking into picking up what I considered to be my ""endgame"" keyboard when I first got into this hobby and am looking to trade some of the stuff listed here for it or just buy it with paypal. I am looking for **only** a Black Polycarbonate Think 6.5 v1 preferably with the badge but I am not against a badge-less one. Preferably unbuilt or Hotswap. 

Here is what I have to sell/trade:

* MGA Standard Black - Built with stock 68g Boba U4T's on an Aluminum Plate with a red Project Keyboard Alice PCB. Has Cherry Clip-ins with Cannonkeys wires Lubed with 205g0 on housing and Permatex on wires. - **Looking to get $275 USD Shipped**

* Sneakbox Hotswap Alice PCB, Aluminum Alice Plate, and Rotary Encoder with Black Knob - These are from his recent sale. I am looking to get back what I have into it. - ~~Looking to get $105 USD Shipped~~ **SOLD**

* Switch Couture X Mechlovin Alice PCB - This is a Top side USB-C PCB so it does not work with all Alices. - ~~Looking to get $60 USD Shipped~~ **SOLD**

* GMK Skidata+ Base Kit - ~~Looking to get $230 USD Shipped~~ **Decided not to sell**

* GMK ASCII Base Kit + Spacebars Kit (Has some shine, the gray hides it fairly well but these are not unused.)  - ~~Looking to get $250 USD Shipped~~ **SOLD**


I am not interested in any trades other than for an unbuilt Think 6.5 V1 in Black Polycarbonate. I'd prefer to just buy the board through paypal and recoup my money through selling the other stuff though. Priority goes to bundles, CONUS only for free shipping, willing to ship anywhere as long as buyer covers shipping costs. Local to 85706, cheaper if picked up locally.

Howdy, I am looking to sell my Mode Eighty to fund other keyboard interests. 

I have a Mode 80 in Deco colorway, and it is built with 8008 inks that are lubed lightly with 205g0 on just the stem, 1514 on springs. It is on a POM plate with c3 stabilizers that are lubed with 205g0 and dielectric grease. Built without the middle gasket. It will come with the original carrying case as well as all extra screws and allen wrenchs and one extra daugtherboard cable. 

I also have extras that I am looking to bundle with the Mode Eighty, the extras are 3x Middle Gaskets, 1x Hotswap Bottom Gasket, 1x Fr4 Plate, 1x Gold Aluminum Plate, 1x Black Aluminum Hotswap Plate, 2x Desoldered PCB's (both tested with tweezers and work flawlessly), and 1x Hotswap PCB.

My asking price for the bundle is **$850 USD + shipping.** I am willing to split the bundle but only after someone has purchased the board. Would much prefer just to sell all together though. ~~If you want just the board built either the way it is (8008 inks) or hotswap I will sell it for **$600 + shipping**~~ **SOLD**

I am open to a trade for a Black PC Think6.5 v1, but am only interested in that version of the Think 6.5.

Hello! I have a Voice65 in E-White that comes with a pc plate and an aluminum plate. The board has been barely used and mainly used for typing tests which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arwN7CDf8uI). No flaws, dings or anything. Gaskets are already installed on the case, as well as some smokey durock stabs lubed with krytox 205g0 and permatex. Everything in original box including box is included. 

I also have Infinikey Pastel Rainbow w/ Add-on kit barely used as well. No shine

I am currently looking for an unbuilt savage65, preference is rose gold but I'd still be interested in different colors! The other board mentioned above I'm also interested in. Also any other interesting 65% I'd consider trading. I'd be willing to trade both the Voice65 and Infinikey set for one board. I am also interested in Japanese keysets for trade with the Infinikey set! Thanks!

Up for sale is a Maxkey Foundation Base Kit. Very good condition with no visible shine (mounted for a week and removed for an mt3 set) and standard Maxkey QC. Only issue is the 6.25u spacebar is missing. Instead, I have included a black Maxkey 6.25u spacebar. I think this is a decent match because the alpha font color is black. I have included pictures of the full set so you can see what you get.

Downsizing my collection. Brand new or used, I'm the first and only owner. Condition is clearly stated with close-up photos in timestamp to show condition. All items come with **original and full packaging just like when newly shipped,** unless otherwise stated.

Payment: All through Paypal Goods and Services for your peace of mind as it comes with buyer's protection, unless you specifically request other methods otherwise.

I ship globally to your residential country or to your Singapore forwarder address (I'm based in Singapore), shipping estimate:

1. Shipping to your Singapore forwarder address, less than 7 USD;
2. Shipping to your residential country:

a. Standard shipping (selective countries only) - **7-15 USD** for smaller items, **12-35 USD** for bigger items.

b. Express shipping - **25 USD onwards**; keyboard will be usually 50 **USD onwards (shiping within Asia will be cheaper)**. For goods value above 300 USD, I will only recommend to ship with Express option given faster turnaround and better point-to-point tracking. Combine multiple purchases to save on shipping as there's always a base weight charged.

Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

Looking to sell my GMK Eclipse bundle (Base, Spacebars, 40s, Pale Blue Accents, Orange Accents) for $240 shipped or $200 local cash pick up (zip code 93012).

&#x200B;

I tried my best to get the best picture possible of the gaming keys to show the quality of the keycaps. Majority of sets will have shine on these specific keys before the rest. You can see they retain their grainy texture/look and that there is no shine. I paid 300 for the bundle about 7 months ago and they saw light to medium use. I work a lot of hours and don't get to jump on the computer much. Not trying to make a profit... they just got me through until my other GMK sets started to roll in.

&#x200B;

The caps will ship in these 5 bags you see pictured. The bag with red zip lock consists of the keys that i pulled directly off my RAMA M65. Of the other 4 bags, 1 consists of spacebars, 1 consists of both the orange and pale blue accents, 1 consists of the 40s kit, and the last bag holds the rest of the base kit.

&#x200B;

Other than the pale blue accents, what you see in the red top zip lock bag are the only keys I ever mounted when I bought them (what you would need for a 65% board). Everything else you see in the bundle was untouched by me, and I was told the entire set was pretty much pretty much unused when I bought it.

&#x200B;

Comment before you PM and no chat please.

Hey all,

Just upgraded to a more permanent board so I am selling my KBD67v2 MKII Gray kit. The board comes with:

&#x200B;

Gray case (excellent/like new condition)

Brass plate

Brass weight

Hotswap PCB

MK Ultra case and plate foam

OA (Original Aspiration) stabilizers -- BNIB. Not currently installed on PCB. I will ship the stabs in original GB packaging along with the keyboard. Link:  [https://cannonkeys.com/products/gb-oa-stabilizers-from-wuque-studio](https://cannonkeys.com/products/gb-oa-stabilizers-from-wuque-studio) \-- absolutely beautiful stabs.

Screws/Hardware

Bonus: Unused Spacebar Foams (12$ value  [https://kbdfans.com/products/spacebar-foam?variant=34275185819787](https://kbdfans.com/products/spacebar-foam?variant=34275185819787) )

&#x200B;

Case itself is in near perfect condition. Zero blemishes, scratches or dings that I can see. PCB has some slight discoloration from when I wiped off a little lube from the stabilizers which is no big deal and has no impact on performance. No other issues at all from what I can see or that I experienced. Was a fantastic board for about 6 months of light to medium use and was taken good care of. Currently out of stock on kbdfans with over 900 people on the wait list.

&#x200B;

**Asking price:** $280 all in, including shipping to CON US only. $240 Local cash pick up (93012 zipcode).

&#x200B;

**\*\*\*\* Also looking to buy GMK Umbra in really good condition or BNIB. Willing to pay for it outright, or trade my board + additional paypal on my end for GMK Umbra. Post, then PM, to discuss. \*\*\*\***

Hey all,

Just upgraded to a more permanent board so I am selling my KBD67v2 MKII Silver. The board comes with:

&#x200B;

Silver case (excellent/like new condition)

Brass plate

Brass weight

Hotswap PCB

MK Ultra case and plate foam

Screws/Hardware

Bonus: Unused Spacebar Foams (12$ value  [https://kbdfans.com/products/spacebar-foam?variant=34275185819787](https://kbdfans.com/products/spacebar-foam?variant=34275185819787) )

&#x200B;

Case itself is in near perfect condition. Zero blemishes, scratches or dings that I can see. PCB has some slight discoloration from when I wiped off a little lube from the stabilizers which is no big deal and has no impact on performance. No other issues at all from what I can see or that I experienced. Was a fantastic board for about 6 months of light to medium use and was taken good care of. Currently out of stock on kbdfans with over 900 people on the wait list.

&#x200B;

**Asking price:** $280 all in, including shipping to CON US only. $240 Local cash pick up (93012).

~~Hello!~~

~~I am selling a few items from my collection as I have narrowed down my preferences and have a new board/keycaps on the way. Here is what I am selling:~~

**~~The Mark65 PC Hot Swap Keyboard~~**

~~The keyboard is built with Durock V2 stabilizers (lubed with 205g0) and StupidFish plate and case foam. This board was used by StupidFish to create the foams so it will include the prototypes as well as an extra set of foams. Has the gold aluminum plate. The plate was modified as the slots for the stabilizers around the spacebar were too small so I had to take out some prongs and bend in the edges a bit (see photo). This cannot be seen when the keyboard is built and was necessary to make the stabs work properly (it is a common issue with these plates). If you want to try your luck with a new plate, extras will be going on sale soon but I can't imagine the dimensions will be different. Comes with extra hot swap PCB and a few extra screws. Will also include an extra 2u stabilizer since it is currently built for split backspace and does not have a stabilizer installed for backspace.~~

~~SELLING FOR $330 SHIPPED~~ **SOLD FOR ASKING**

&#x200B;

**~~Future Funk PBT Keycaps~~**

~~Purchased from Ali Express and used for about one week. Still in good condition and comes with proper setup for most configurations (1.75u shift).~~

~~SELLING FOR $50 SHIPPED~~ **SOLD FOR ASKING**

&#x200B;

**~~ePBT GOK BoW Keycap Set~~**

~~This set was used for about 3 weeks and comes with an extra 6.25u spacebar. One spacebar has foam inside that I cut to reduce echo but it can easily be removed or you can just use the other spacebar.~~

\- 210327 1610 I got started later than expected today. Sorry, and thank you for your patience, to those waiting for invoices. I will be sending them out all evening.

\- 210328 13:09 I sent the first round of invoices out yesterday evening and I've continued sending them today. Most people didn't ask for keyboard kits and their extras. It's taken longer to negotiate who gets what as a result. Sorry about the delay and thank you  for your patience.

\- 210328 17:05 I finished sending the first round of invoices earlier today. There are a few more pending sales than usual after some time. I'm guessing that half of them are going to back out and I'll send another round of invoices to the next buyers in line. I've crossed out what's been sold already above.

\- 210320 12:42 All of the first round of invoices have paid or backed out. There are buyers next in line for Prophet and Taro but they haven't been sent invoices yet (or they have and they've backed out also so the cycle is repeating). Most of the first round of sales have been shipped. A few are waiting to be collected, dropped off, and/or for contact details for tracking.

\- 210402 12:42 All of the items requested in the first rush of entries have been sold. I've been responding to later requests/entries as they've trickled in.",bought gmk red samurai r1 from u/juliandoucette,"[UK] [H] Polaris, Prophet, Sirius, Klippe S, Ergonomic keyboards, Keycaps, Switches, Deskmats, and Artisans [W] PayPal"

Hello, r/mechmarket;

It's time to let go of my topre collection.

Prices are listed in GBP but I'll also accept EUR or USD.

I'll prefer UK > EU > Other buyers to reduce shipping costs and risks.

I will not undervalue items if I ship them internationally.

I'll prefer to sell cases (e.g. Norbaforce) with boards (e.g. Realforce R2) unless there are separate buyers for both parts.

These prices may seem high to international buyers. International shipping, import, handling, and PayPal fees add up quickly.

|Condition rating|Explanation|
|:-|:-|
|1|New / Unused|
|9.5|Like new / Used for display and/or testing only|
|.9|Like new / Used for a very short time only|

All topre board cases, except for the 87UB, have been carefully removed once.

**Pro tip**: Comment ""pm"" first then [send me a private message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=juliandoucette&subject=topre%20sale&message=Items%3A%0A%0A1.%20Thing%201%0A2.%20Thing%202%0A%0ACurrency%3A%20GBP%0A%0ALocation%3A%20UK%0A%0AEmail%3A%20someone%40somewhere.com) including what you want to buy, the currency you want to pay with, the country you want me to ship to, and your PayPal email address. Then I can respond by reserving the item for you and sending you a payable invoice including the cost of shipping in your preferred currency without further discussion and you can choose to ask further questions, pay, or back out in your own time.

## FAQ

## How much does shipping to X cost?

There are no hard and fast rules, unfortunately. I'm not a vendor and I'm not marking up the items that I'm selling to average out the costs of shipping. I prefer to use Royal Mail 1st class signed for, guaranteed delivery, or international tracked and signed. But I sometimes use parcel2go e.g. for larger and/or more expensive international deliveries. Both of these services have estimation wizards that you can use to guess shipping costs in advance if you're curious.

## How long does shipping to X take?

It varies. Delivery services around the world are backed up to different degrees at different times. I've had US deliveries arrive in less than a week. And I've had US deliveries arrive after more than 2 months in the last year.

## How come you paid so much for item X? Y site says that it costs less!

I paid retail, group buy, or extras price for most of my items. But international shipping, import fees (>=20%), and handling fees (>=9GBP) add up quickly. And EU vendors usually sell for higher base prices than US. That's why some items (e.g. laser desk mats) are more expensive (they were not available in the EU/UK) and I'm taking larger losses to try to sell them at reasonable prices. Finally, of course, I'm human and I make mistakes. Please drop me a message if you think I've made a mistake so that I can fix it!

# Updates

\- 2021/03/09 02:35 I sorted the first round of entries and messaged everyone that I plan to send invoices to but I haven't finished sending invoices yet.

\- 2021/03/10 00:52 I sent invoices to everyone that I messaged last night and most of them paid. The Bingsu buyer has not paid yet. I haven't looked at offers that came in over the last 24h yet. And I haven't struck items that have been sold in the table above yet. I will do that as soon as I can tomorrow.

\- 2021/03/10 11:43 I removed sold items from the gform and struck them out in the table above. The Bingsu buyer backed out. I will download and sort form entries again and send an invoice to the next buyer tonight. I sent two types of messages 2021/03/09. One said (paraphrasing) ""Form entry recieved. I'll sort entries and send invoices as soon as I can"". And the other said (paraphrasing) ""I chose your entry and I'll send you an invoice asap"". Sorry to those in the first group that thought that they were in the second when I said ""I messaged everyone that I plan to send invoices to"". I should have been clearer.

\- 2021/03/12 12:45 I shipped the first round of sales and I am packing the second round of sales. Offers are trickling in and I'm responding to them as soon as I can.

\- 2021/03/14 10:27 I shipped the third round of sales yesterday. I'll probably close the form and post another ad soon.

\- 2021/03/19 11:18 I shipped the fifth round of sales earlier this week. Some of the items that have been sold haven't been crossed out above yet. If you submitted my form and I didn't get back to you then someone probably submitted a better offer for most of the items in your entry before you did.

Hey r/mk, 

Looking to offload some items: 

~~**Lin Whale R2 Navy - $825 shipped OBO** [Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/22gi97I)~~ SOLD for $700

~~- This is the navy color, and has the slight ano mismatch that all whales are known to have. It's built with a Retooled blacks lubed with 205g0, TX filmed, and spring swapped to 62g 16mm TX. The plate is Half POM, and the stabs are C3 Navy lubed with 205g0 on housing, and Dielectric hand painted on wire. Similar to how XHT-BDZ is done. It does have a dent in the bottom right near the screw as seen in the linked pictures (this does not effect usability in anyway, and the case can be opened and reassembled just fine). I planned on fixing this, and bought it this way but never got around to this. This is at cost for me, but putting OBO as totally understand due to the dent. The anime sticker on bottom came from previous user, and definitely remove it if you want me too. It's not stuck on there, and super easy to take off. I just did not do it for the photos.~~ 

~~**Black Acrylic Alice - $250 shipped** [Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/RfxOc8z)~~ TRADED

~~- This is a matte black Acrylic Alice known as the Ergosaurus. It is using a Ergosaurus PCB, and acrylic half plate built with KS3 Gateron Yellows lubed with Carbon GS2, and GPL105 on springs. Durock stabilizers lubed with 205g0 on housing, and Dielectric hand painted on wire. Also has a stainless steel bottom that I had cut for it to make it heftier, and change the acoustics. This added roughly 3lbs to the weight of the case.~~

**Gasket Acrylic P3D Prime E - $260 shipped** [Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/4RAEUkI)

- This is matte black from P3D, and is built with Creamerons (cream in milky yellow gat housing) lubed with 205g0, and GPL105 on the spring. Durock stabilizers lubed with 205g0 on housing, and Dielectric hand painted on wire. It has a custom cut brass plate, and brass bottom that I had cut as well for added heft, and acoustics. Will also include the FR4 plate that came with it should you want to use it. This is at cost as getting the Brass plate, and bottom cut from sendcutsend alone was $145 (dumb I know, but really wanted that brass bottom). 

~~**Lily58 Black - $120 shipped**~~ SOLD for $115 

~~- Built with hotswap sockets, fr4 plates, elite Cs on both sides as well as oleds. Built this to get back into split ergo, but realized it's not my thing anymore. Only used briefly.~~

~~**GMK KA1953 - $210 shipped**~~ SOLD for asking 

~~- No signs of wear or use as only mounted this for 30 minutes, and did not like it at all.~~

~~**ePBT Retro Cyrillic - $160 shipped**~~ SOLD for asking

~~- Same with the KA above I've only used this for about 30 mins as did not like it. More of a GMK fan myself, but otherwise set is practically brand new.~~

GMK botanical base is sealed. Looking to trade for GMK Cafe or Bingsu. Will add/ask for PayPal depending on conditions. Probably won’t sell this unless local or I find a Bingsu/cafe set to purchase first.

Edit: will sell botanical for $340 shipped (sorry for high side, just so after shipping and fees I’d have enough to hopefully pick up bingsu or cafe)

#Switch Lubing/Modding Service
[Work Station & Example of Lubing — 30,000+ switches lubed](https://imgur.com/a/HreuCIa)   

| `Service` | `Pricing` |
| :- | :-: |
| `Switch Lubing` | **$0.50^(/switch)** — **$0.60^(/switch)** my lube |
| `Frankenswitch Lubing` | **$0.65^(/switch)** — **$0.75^(/switch)** my lube |

| `Spring Swapping` | **$0.10^(/spring)** | 
| `Stabilizer Tuning/Lubing` | **$2.00^(/stabilizer)** |

###How It Works
1) [Fill out the order form](https://forms.gle/AyBtXJiaLHn66CVWA)  
2) You ship your things to me  
> Buyer covers shipping both ways

3) I complete your order, send an invoice, and ship everything back  
> Everything will be shipped back in the same packaging

#FAQ
1. Which parts of the switch do I lube?  
> Bottom housing, stem (tactile legs aren't lubed), and spring   
>
> ***Disclaimer: Unless otherwise stated, factory lube is not removed*** 

2. What is 205g2+105 and how does it compare to 205g0?    
>  205g2+105 is a 1:1 mixture of 205g2 and 105 commonly used among Korean keyboard enthusiasts, popular Youtuber [:3ildcat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeHOkFGW-7uAZFvq3BXb8YA), and sold by [TX Keyboards](https://www.us.txkeyboards.com/products/krytox-lube?variant=31403083825212). The result is a mixture with a consistency very similar to 205g0, which is a mixture of 105 and PTFE powder.

3. What is your turnaround time?
> 1-3 days depending on when I receive your switches and/or materials

4. These sales cannot be confirmed for trade flair

> All switches are lubed and filmed the following materials:  
> — Krytox 205g2+105: bottom housing and stem  
> — Krytox 105: springs  
> — TX Film: 0.15mm & 0.125mm

2. What is 205g2+105 and how does it compare to 205g0?    
>  205g2+105 is a 1:1 mixture of 205g2 and 105 commonly used among Korean keyboard enthusiasts, popular Youtuber [:3ildcat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeHOkFGW-7uAZFvq3BXb8YA), and sold by [TX Keyboards](https://www.us.txkeyboards.com/products/krytox-lube?variant=31403083825212). The result is a mixture with a consistency very similar to 205g0, which is a mixture of 105 and PTFE powder.

3. What is your turnaround time?
> 1-3 days depending on when I receive your switches and/or materials

|[~~D65 Clear Polycarbonate Hotswap Kit~~](https://imgur.com/a/iS6BIgv)|~~Includes an Instant65 hotswap PCB instead of the original KBD67 pcb which doesn't have the RGB underglow that looks amazing on this board. Has a PC plate, gaskets were installed on the case. Overall great condition, the brass weight looks pretty good. I had to dremel part of the USB-C port and enter key stab to make the PCB fit.

Just got NIB [Cherry KXN3-8451](https://imgur.com/a/7nat8aX) from 84, the keyboard is known for being one of the first cherry keyboards released with the mx blacks, these switches have a lighter original spring, as far as I know, about 62g, after I tried it, I was dissatisfied with the switches, they seemed to me not smooth enough and uniform, so I decided to sell them. I sell a keyboard without a case, so that delivery from Russia does not cost a fortune. Price $160 shipped worldwide

I likewise have a Black Physix build with lubed/filmed Novelkey blacks on a red alu plate. Shes a buttery one. I have one spare PCB and one spare red alu plate to match. As seen, it comes in the original case provided by the man himself.

As for the GMK Bento Kits, I would STRONGLY prefer not to split the kits. It will include the Rama in the basekit as well. I wont split unless the deal is too stronk to refuse.
