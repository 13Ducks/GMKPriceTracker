Happy almost-Friday, friends!

It's a full purge, this time -- getting rid of almost everything I own. **Local to Los Angeles, 90006. Not FCFS, priority goes to local and/or bundled deals. All bundles will get discounts.** I'm happy to talk more about stuff in DMs or provide photos of specific things upon request. The usual: comment before PM, no chats because I have them disabled. Have a good weekend, y'all.

**Just to reemphasize: priority goes to local and/or bundled deals.**

Item | Price | Notes
:-- | :-- | :--
PC HHKB Leaf60 | ~~$350 local, $375 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Built with Gat Black Inks, PC plate, Zeal stabs, and black back weight. I bought this one off [this nice person](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/kk0l7j/kr_h_leaf60_hhkb_rama_heavy_industry_seq2_w_paypal/) from Korea and it is beautiful but I've moved onto something different. I was forgot to take photos myself but if you check their timestamps, you can find a crack on the inside of the top housing, which isn't noticeable when built/in use. Will come in box with extra top housing. Pictured in **new timestamp** with the PBT WoB keycaps, not included in price but will include for $50.
HHKB Classic Charcoal | ~~$200 local, $220 shipped~~ **pending** | Bought from someone here. Sliders are very lightly lubed with 3204 but could probably do with a more thorough brush over. Will come in original box, original black spacebar, blue & red PBT spacebars, and RAMA cable as I don't have the original.
[GMK Laser R1](https://imgur.com/rNeCyzp) | ~~$375 local, $400 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Base, gaijin, spacebar, and blocknet kits. These were my daily driver for a little under a month so they have been used but there is little to no shine, not that I could find at least. Price is for base kit shipped in GMK tray and the rest in bags.
GMK Peach Blossom | ~~$220 local, $230 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Bought this set sealed from someone local, used and mounted for less than an hour. I actually sold this to somebody in an older post but unbeknownst to me, two keycaps were missing but were eventually found but the person ended up just returning the set. Box is banged up on one corner but trays are in still in good condition.
GMK Penumbra | ~~$115 local, $130 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Bought from someone local, in bags, as is. There is some shine on some random keys that I tried my best to capture, again, if you scroll down [this timestamp](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/lll49u/usca_h_kuro_m60a_pc_hhkb_leaf60_ewhite_hhkb/).
[Alcatel MMK Doubleshots](https://imgur.com/NIfimo1) | ~~$50 local, $60 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Forgot who I bought these from but these are doubleshot keycaps from an [Alcatel MMK](https://deskthority.net/wiki/images/thumb/a/a0/Alcatel_004.jpg/640px-Alcatel_004.jpg) -- what you see is what you get. Bought these to use for a display board but would prefer they just go to a good home. Shipped in bag.
Laser aviator cable | $40 local, $50 shipped | **The one with the blue heatshrinks.** Bought to go with ePBT Sushi and I thought it went really well together since it has blue connectors and is a lighter shade than other Laser-themed cables.
Laser YC-8 cable | $50 local, $60 shipped | **The one with the purple heatshrinks.** Bought from u/ThePrinkus, one of the nicer cables I've had the pleasure of trying. I paired this with the Laser R1 set and this shade works really well but just going another direction.

MX Hyperglides x70 | $60 local, $70 shipped | Lubed and filmed by previous owner, not sure with what though.
Zeal Zilents x47 | $40 local, $50 shipped | 67g, *think* these are stock.
118 Ergo Clears and extra parts | $80 local, $100 shipped | This consists of the bags to the left and bottom of Peach Blossom in the most recent timestamp. It contains a bag with 118 Ergo Clears, clear top Panda housings, Kiwi stems, MX Clear springs, more springs which I'm unsure of, a bag of 48 stock Kailh Purples, and a bunch of clicky Kailh switches like the Box Pink and Box Jade.
C3 Equalz stabilizers | ~~$15 local, $20 shipped or free if you buy $100 worth of stuff~~ **Sold!** | Bought to potentially use for friends' builds but never ended up getting used.",sold built switch couture alice and gmk hennessey to u/hllce,"[US-CA] [H] HHKB Classic, PC Leaf60 HHKB, GMK Laser R1, GMK Peach Blossom, GMK Penumbra, OG Doubleshots, PBT WoB Keycaps, Laser YC8 & Aviator Cable, A Lot of Switches [W] Local Cash, PayPal"

Happy Friday, friends!

Nearly done clearing out my entire inventory of stuff I've hoarded and soon I'll be able to stop attending Hoarders Anonymous meetings. **Local to Los Angeles, 90006.

:-- | :-- | :--
Modern M0110 | ~~$475 local, $500 shipped~~ **Sold!** | [Built/glamour shots here.](https://imgur.com/a/WztPehW) I picked this board up from John himself and it is beautiful, the shotpeen finish is one of the coolest I've seen on a metal case. Unfortunately, top mount just isn't for me. It's a heavy baby, weighing at over 7 pounds built. Will come in original box with case, plate, screws, allen wrench but no PCB, stabilizers, keycaps, etc.
KBDfans D60 | $375 local, $400 shipped | [Semi-built/glamour shots here.](https://imgur.com/a/4NKE2Dh) Bought this direct from KBDfans last month as I waited to find a grail and I found one sooner than expected. Really great board for the value, would recommend for people who want to try gasket mount, HHKB, or both. Black with purple weight and accents, built with lubed & filmed H1s (205g0 switch, 105 stem, Kebo film), C3 cream stabilizers (205g0 housing, dielectric grease wire, KBDfans stab pads) on a DZ60WKL with an FR4 plate and plate foam installed **but not** case foam. Will come in original box with board, extra gaskets, alu plate, spacebar foam, and case foam. **The D60 is still in stock on KBDfans if you want a brand new kit, you'll just get faster shipping and more extras buying my stuff.**
GMK Hennessey | ~~$180 local, $200 shipped~~ **Oops!** | **Was totally unaware that [extras are currently running on Drop right now](https://drop.com/buy/drop-mito-gmk-hennessey-custom-keycap-set). Also decided that I wanna keep them for now.** ~~Bought local from someone. Mounted it for a few minutes on another board, just don't need it and don't want it to become another thing I hold onto for way too long while it collects dust. Priority for local buyers because I don't have a shipping box for it (yet) and shipping the new GMK trays spooks me.~~
DZ60RGB-WKL | ~~$55 local, $65 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Bought this to test out in the M0110, only mounted one set of switches and typed on for five minutes. This is in stock at several places (e.g. [KBDfans](https://kbdfans.com/products/dz60rgb-wkl-hot-swap-pcb)) but I'll also throw plate and case foam in with it.
Laser aviator cable | $40 local, $50 shipped | **The one with the blue heatshrinks.** Bought to go with ePBT Sushi and I thought it went really well together since it has blue connectors and is a lighter shade than other Laser-themed cables.
Laser YC-8 cable | $50 local, $60 shipped | **The one with the purple heatshrinks.** Bought from u/ThePrinkus, one of the nicer cables I've had the pleasure of trying. I paired this with the Laser R1 set and this shade works really well but just going another direction.

Switch part lot | $50 local, $60 shipped | This is everything in the timestamp below the DZ60 and to the right of the cables. It contains a bag of clear top Panda housings, Kiwi stems, MX Clear springs, more springs which I'm unsure of, a bag of 48 stock Kailh Purples, and a bunch of clicky Kailh switches like the Box Pink and Box Jade.
C3 translucent pink stabilizers | ~~$10 local or add-on shipped~~ **Sold!** | Never used. Comes with 3 2u wires, 1 6.25u wire, **no 7u wire**, housings, screws, and washers.
Durock smoky stabilizers | ~~$10 local or add-on shipped~~ **Sold!** | Two sets with 3 2u wires, 1 6.25u wire, **no 7u wire,** housings, and screws. Lightly lubed with 205g0 on the housings and dielectric grease on the wires.

**Metropolis R2 and Handarbeit R2 are running in April and May respectively.** I looked up recent for sale prices for each to try and be in the ballpark but if I'm off just cite your sources or flame me

Prices in USD. Shipping included in USA. I need a sizeable additional financial incentive to ship outside of the US right now. I’m in Houston, local is cheaper.

Lightly used and does have a tiny nick by the backspace button that is not noticeable at all with keycaps. Comes with l&f alpaca switches as well as purple C3 stabs that are lubed. Has a milmaxed pcb.

* Space65 Black/Gold with grey led badge. FR4 plate. $650

Lightly used. Does not have any blemishes or nicks as far as I can tell. Led badge is a bit loose due to the magnet but that can be fixed easily with superglue and is very normal with these badges. Has a milmaxed pcb.

IGNORE THE DESK MATS PART OF THE TITLE. Made a mistake in adding that to the title sorry lol. 

CONUS only please. Comment before PM, please no chats. Primarily looking for trades on certain items that will be specified but will likely sell if none are found. Items that I can buy outright or trade  for are the following Rama U80 (hotswap, any colorway), Mode80 (hotswap, any colorway other than the ART series colors), other interesting TKL's (prefer brand new or light use with no flaws), GMK sets (prefer brand new or no shine, and nothing that has recently come out please), and artisans.

* Think 6.5 V2 Darth Vader 1U - $720 - Built and used for an hour (too many 65% boards). No flaws besides scratches on FR4 board from removing switches. Built with C3 purple stabilizers and a hotswap pcb from an Asia exclusive GB. Will include a brand new solder pcb as well as all original accessories except the tweezers. Will not come with anything that is pictured (keycaps and artisans). SOLD
* Grey Vega - Trades - No flaws visible to the eye. Comes with everything that was included originally. Hotswap pcb with aluminum plate. Gaskets are mounted on the plate and not the case. (Again too many 65% boards).
* GMK Bingsu Base - Trades - Not sealed but has not been typed on so brand new in box. Purchased right before being offered a sealed set so I will be getting rid of this one.
* GMK Botanical Base and Spacebars - Trades - BNIB
* Burgundy TOFU65 - $140 - BNIB with underglow pcb and aluminum plate. Comes with free braided cable SOLD
* BOB artisans are $70 each

Downsizing my collection. Brand new or used, I'm the first and only owner. Condition is clearly stated with close-up photos in timestamp to show condition. All items come with **original and full packaging just like when newly shipped,** unless otherwise stated.

Payment: All through Paypal Goods and Services for your peace of mind as it comes with buyer's protection, unless you specifically request other methods otherwise.

I ship globally to your residential country or to your Singapore forwarder address (I'm based in Singapore), shipping estimate:

1. Shipping to your Singapore forwarder address, less than 7 USD;
2. Shipping to your residential country:

a. Standard shipping (selective countries only) - **7-15 USD** for smaller items, **12-35 USD** for bigger items.

b. Express shipping - **25 USD onwards**; keyboard will be usually 50 **USD onwards (shiping within Asia will be cheaper)**. For goods value above 300 USD, I will only recommend to ship with Express option given faster turnaround and better point-to-point tracking. Combine multiple purchases to save on shipping as there's always a base weight charged.

When installing switches, the hotswap socket fully popped off the PCB along with the solder pads. I tried to solder the pads back onto the PCB (as you can see from the photos lol. I didn't now any better and wrecked that thing), but it was too far gone.  This is the only key that doesn't work. As a work around, I set the ( "" ) key on layer 2 to act as the semi-colon. The rest of the PCB is fully functional. I believe this can be repaired with wiring it to another hotswap socket with wire and soldering, but I'd rather just leave that up to someone else. There is noticeable warping on the front of the case that persists in all of the polycarb variants. This is an issue that was brought up by multiple PC owners in the Boardsource Discord channel.

But now I've got a bit of breathing room and am opening up a couple of commission slots :) My guide price is **£34**, which which would come with a 10cm coil, double sleeved in MDPC-X and Techflex, and a GX16 aviator. Or upgrade to a coloured aviator for only £10! (Or a LEMO if you feel like having some tough talks with your accountant.) Other connectors and upgrades also available - mini-XLR, Weipu, etc. 

My turnaround time at the moment is about 5-10 days if I have everything in stock.  

For some examples of my work, check out my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hectoring_mk/) or have a look at the ready to ship cables below. (The crossed out ones have sold but can be back ordered.) Typical tracked shipping costs for one cable: UK £5 EU £11-13 ROW £15-19*.

Hi there! Selling two keyboards that I no longer need. I'm selling these at cost - [please see here how much i paid for all these originally.](https://imgur.com/a/4iXay8F)

1. KBD8X MKII WKL E-Yellow - **415$ + Shipping**
   1. Purchased this for my mother on Black friday but she ended up not liking the color. I kept it for myself but I can't justify owning two TKL's right now. Brand new, only opened for pictures and to test the PCB. **Comes with Keyboard, Brass Plate, Poly Plate, Solder PCB, Hardware, KBDFans Stabs, Bumpons.**


**CANDYBAR AND KEYCAPS HAVE SOLD**

2. CandyBar Premium Lefty E-White - **$315 + Shipping**
   1. I really love this board. I lined it Sorbothane and added KBDFans foam to the plate. Sounds great with tactile switches. I only changed switches twice so the PCB is working perfectly. But it's been collecting dust, and with the other keyboard purchases I've made, I don't see myself using this board anymore. If you like or want to try 40% this is the best intro to the wonderful world of tiny keebs. **Comes with the original box, hardware, documentation, Keyboard, Aluminum plate, hot-swap PCB, and Sorbothane inside the case.**
3. CandyBar Sherbet Keycaps - **60$ + Shipping**
   1. Had these on my Candybar and I love the look. But they belong with the Candybar. Comes in the original box with box trays.

I'm willing to bundle the Candybar and Keycaps for **370$ + Shipping.**

Downsizing my collection. Brand new or used, I'm the first and only owner. Condition is clearly stated with close-up photos in timestamp to show condition. All items come with **original and full packaging just like when newly shipped,** unless otherwise stated.

Payment: All through Paypal Goods and Services for your peace of mind as it comes with buyer's protection, unless you specifically request other methods otherwise.

I ship globally to your residential country or to your Singapore forwarder address (I'm based in Singapore), shipping estimate:

1. Shipping to your Singapore forwarder address, less than 7 USD;
2. Shipping to your residential country:

a. Standard shipping (selective countries only) - **7-15 USD** for smaller items, **12-35 USD** for bigger items.

b. Express shipping - **25 USD onwards**; keyboard will be usually 50 **USD onwards (shiping within Asia will be cheaper)**. For goods value above 300 USD, I will only recommend to ship with Express option given faster turnaround and better point-to-point tracking. Combine multiple purchases to save on shipping as there's always a base weight charged.

Hey everyone,

Ended up purchasing another keycap set and some computer parts so I am trying to get rid of some of my current collection to help pay for some of that stuff. I bought the gmk camping r2 late last year brand new and have used it for a few months before putting it back in the box. I made the matching coiled cable this year for it but I put that back in storage when I put the keycaps away.

I don't have a host end for the cable but I have some leftover parts from older projects of mine that I can include if you want to try and make your own host end for it (I think the longest piece of usb 2.0 cabling I have is around 3ft?). If you want to make it match this cable exactly I can provide you with the parts list you need to buy from zap cables and the wiring diagram to follow. I can solder up the leftover parts for you for an additional $10 if you don't feel comfortable doing it yourself.

I also have a cable that I sleeved and coiled to try and match the vilebloom keycap set, but the paracord splicing wasn't clean enough for my standards so I put it away for storage. Figured someone else could put it to good use instead of it sitting around.

Inspired by the colours and landscape surrounding the legendary mountain, this set brings a stylish look to your keyboard. The set features dark blue Latin and Katakana legends on white alphas, with lighter blue-grey mods. The pink of the accents resemble the iconic sakura.

**Kits:**

[Latin base](https://i.imgur.com/9bIOqnN.png) | [Katakana base](https://i.imgur.com/wnMwGer.png) \- Pretty straightforward. Provides the compatibility you need for most layouts, while keeping it as trimmed down as possible.

[Addition](https://i.imgur.com/Phluo6t.png) \- To cover some more niche layouts and give legend options that weren't in the base kit, as well TGR Alice-like layouts. Basic 40s compatibility also included.

[Novelties](https://i.imgur.com/HxOfozG.png) \- Made in collaboration with Sour, to add a bit more personality to your board.

[International](https://i.imgur.com/tBbzPdv.png) \- Your standard kit for European layouts - support for British, Finnish, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and German keyboards.

[Sakura](https://i.imgur.com/JCp3aDq.png) \- Accent spacebars, for an extra splash of colour.

Hi, all!

I have two NK65 Entry Editions for sale.

|Item|Notes|Price|
|:-|:-|:-|
|~~NK65 EE Beige~~|~~Almost brand-new condition. Got it from another user about a week ago but since then I got the Milkshake edition. The only signs of use are the top screws and the barely noticeable plate scratches from removing switches. Lubed/clipped/bandaid-modded stock stabs. Includes the cable and the carry case.~~|$140 + Shipping (**SOLD**)|
|~~NK65 EE Purple~~|~~Also got from another user about a month ago. There are a couple of cracks on the top case which are invisible after installing the keycaps and the top right hand post is broken. These are fairly common for these boards and they did not affect the typing in anyway. Lubed/clipped/bandaid-modded stock stabs. Includes the cable and the carry case.~~|$100 + Shipping (**SOLD**)|

TypeMachina x TGR Jane v1.5 WKL Black, Black Aluminum Plate, Brass Plate, 2 PCBs | Used for about a month or two and decided the sound signature isn't for me. There are two scuffs on the inside of the case. One of the scuffs affects the exterior and shows in-between the two halves of the case on the right side of the board. When I received the board, one of the PCBs was missing a transistor(not sure what this it's called?) causing the left alt key to not work. I rerouted it to a different switch hole and it worked fine. PCBs will be desoldered before shipping. | Trades | Available

Hi there! Selling two keyboards that I no longer need. I'm selling these at cost - [please see here how much i paid for all these originally.](https://imgur.com/a/4iXay8F)

1. KBD8X MKII WKL E-Yellow - **415$ + Shipping**
   1. Purchased this for my mother on Black friday but she ended up not liking the color. I kept it for myself but I can't justify owning two TKL's right now. Brand new, only opened for pictures and to test the PCB. **Comes with Keyboard, Brass Plate, Poly Plate, Solder PCB, Hardware, KBDFans Stabs, Bumpons.**


**CANDYBAR AND KEYCAPS HAVE SOLD**

2. CandyBar Premium Lefty E-White - **$315 + Shipping**
   1. I really love this board. I lined it Sorbothane and added KBDFans foam to the plate. Sounds great with tactile switches. I only changed switches twice so the PCB is working perfectly. But it's been collecting dust, and with the other keyboard purchases I've made, I don't see myself using this board anymore. If you like or want to try 40% this is the best intro to the wonderful world of tiny keebs. **Comes with the original box, hardware, documentation, Keyboard, Aluminum plate, hot-swap PCB, and Sorbothane inside the case.**
3. CandyBar Sherbet Keycaps - **60$ + Shipping**
   1. Had these on my Candybar and I love the look. But they belong with the Candybar. Comes in the original box with box trays.

I'm willing to bundle the Candybar and Keycaps for **370$ + Shipping.**

~~FEI Matcha - $25 shipped~~ SOLD

*Condition*

GMK Olivia is in pristine condition except the outside cover, which is pretty fragile and has some creases. Used once, you'll find there is no shine whatsoever from the closeup photos. 2/3 of spacebar kit is sealed. Switches have never been tampered with. 

*Potential Trade options* 

While I'm leaning towards being paid, I would definitely consider a white/silver/black/grey Space65 for the Olivia. Feel free to amuse me with other offers. 

Switches can be traded for 70 U4T Thocky Boba switches.

**PC / Polycarb / Polycarbonate Vulcan x KBDfans MAJA - 450 usd**

Comes with hotswap PCB, FR4 Plate, Brass Plate, Plate Foam, Case Foam and 5 lubed Smokey Durock V2 stabs. 

There's an issue with the brass weight screwholes where 3 of them were broken in transit from KBDfans. The weight is very snug and honestly would probably work fine without any screws. It's basically impossible for the weight to come loose even without 3 of the screws. Very good condition. Saw a similar one sell for 475, added 25 usd for the extra plate, and took off 50 for the weight issue. Lmk if you think the price isn't reasonable. See pictures for more details. Weight issue seems to be common.

# Keyboards

**Feng's Smart 68 V1 Silver/Red (used) (not to be confused with Magicforce 68 Smart)**

[Geekhack thread](https://web.archive.org/web/20180703134842/https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=83442.0). One of the first custom keyboards that came with hotswap sockets. I am selling a Silver V1 (low profile) with a red plate. Layout B (which is rather unconventional). 

It's actually quite a nice low-profile board. Almost not bezel to it. Here a [few photos with SA keycaps](https://imgur.com/a/p3Nmm) but it also looks quite good with GMK. Stabs need to be relubed.

Price: $160

**~~Cannon Keys Clarabelle Mystery (opened, unbuilt)~~** SOLD for asking

~~I have gotten a few other 40%s recently and I just can't get used to the layout. This here is the Mystery Color (Rose I'd say), Black PVD Badge, Extra PCB.~~

~~Only opened the parts box to check for a part that I want for my other M65-B. The box with the board I didn't open (though one of the seal stickers does not stick).~~

~~Hotswap PCB, and all the little parts. *Does not include any extras like internal dampener or weight*.~~

CONUS only please. I strongly prefer to sell these items in bundles so that takes priority. PM no chat please since they do not give notifications. Small discounts will be given to bundles and everything is OBO (or best offer). Prices are with shipping included and are negotiable. Space65 condition pics are a bit janky but can take more if needed. Items will be shipped out on Tuesday or latest Wednesday. Thank you for taking a look. Love all the items I am posting for sale but have to make space for incoming purchases.

I am also interested in trading for or buying outright the following items E-white/black/navy Vega,  BNIB to lightly used (no shine) GMK DMG + spacebars, GMK Taro R2 + spacebars, GMK First love (with first love rama), GMK Mizu + whatever you got with it. I am also interested in the following artisans Keyby's, Youngster Harris Nightmares, and LastPilots. Artisan wishlist [https://postimg.cc/WFDb6yt1](https://postimg.cc/WFDb6yt1)

UPDATED PRICING DUE TO SOME SALES

* Space65 EVA with black led badge. Carbon Fiber plate. $700 with alpacas $650 without switches. Comes with free purple coiled cable from matrix keyboards.

Lightly used and does have a tiny nick by the backspace button that is not noticeable at all with keycaps. Comes with l&f alpaca switches as well as purple C3 stabs that are lubed. Has a milmaxed pcb.

* Space65 Black/Gold with grey led badge. FR4 plate. $650

Lightly used. Does not have any blemishes or nicks as far as I can tell. Led badge is a bit loose due to the magnet but that can be fixed easily with superglue and is very normal with these badges. Has a milmaxed pcb.

[Trades Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/vepoZ3E)

First and foremost I am REALLY interested in GMK or DCS Miami, I will pay top dollar for either set as I have been looking for quite a while now. I am also looking to expand my 60% collection with older boards as well as the ones I have mentioned below. Please do not message me about any newer massed produced boards like a TOFU, I am really just looking for unusual stuff. 

I am very interested in the following keyboards and Keysets, ones bolded are big wants:

\- **LZ CE from Team Redline (Any colors)**

\- Duck Poker / FMJ 60 (Any colors)

\- Weaven by TriviumTek (Any colors)

\- Hammer Case 60%

\- Honeyboard HB60 (ONLY chrome blue) 

\- Other interesting 60% boards

\- **GMK / DCS Miami** PLEASE HELP ME GET THIS 

\- Ctrl Alt the Bro set

&#x200B;

I also have a couple items I am willing to trade + cash for most of the items listed:

Custom Grado Style Headphones: They have Wabi Sabi Ziricote Cups, Symphone V9 drivers, Shipibo Black Gimbals / Rodblocks, YAXI Pads, and a headband from a pair of SR80's. I also built a custom reversible cable for them as pictured that terminates in 1/4"" and 3.5mm on the headphone end. I ordered all these parts back in late 2020 but had some issues receiving them (Took significantly longer than expected). By the time I got around to building them I really no longer wanted them. They only have about 5 hours of playtime on them and are basically as brand new as you can get with a custom pair of headphones. Also included is a couple G Pads and some extra other parts that were included when I built the headphones. **Looking to trade**

SM keyboards TKL: It is transparent purple and teal with a copper plate. It has a Hineybush 87a PCB and is finished off with Kailh Box Blacks. It has GMK stabilizers, but keep in mind the spacebar stabilizer should probably be replaced. It works fine but it a bit sluggish and quite noisy currently. the tabs holding the bar in place broke so I had to replace them with a dab of hot glue as pictured. A new stabilizer would fix this issue. In addition I am including a set of Hyperfuse origins with all the extra caps as well. If you have any questions feel free to ask. **Looking to trade**",bought gmk hfo from u/blackriver35,"[US-NJ][H]Paypal, SM Keyboards TKL, Grado Symphone V9s [W] GMK Miami, DCS Miami, CTRL ALT The Bro Set, LZ CE, Duck Poker Weaven Keyboards, 60% Hammer Case, Other Old 60% customs"

I am running a small sale on my resin wrist rests. [Here is a link to the order form with more details as well as the color options](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFFi0ZC3H-iVw2GxqdFsg3VcDah79P3GEd7mxi8RhC38719w/viewform?usp=sf_link) . This resin wrist rest is made to order and production time can take up to three weeks depending on demand. We offer a variety of colors, so choose your base color (primary) and choose the design / smoke color (secondary) and we take care of the rest!

&#x200B;

Keep a few things in mind before purchasing:

1. These are all handmade and there may be some defects. The bottom of the wrist rest may have some bubbles and imperfections. Also note the bottom edges will be sanded slightly to remove any sharp spots. This is not noticeable when on the desk, but it is noticeable if you look at the bottom.

2. The wrist rest is not scratch proof. Treat it carefully and clean it with a cotton or microfiber cloth to prevent from scratching it.

3. Do not expose this item to extreme heat, it may be prone to melting.

4. The design spacing and smoke effect may vary with each unit, as previously mentioned it is handmade and crafted so each one is unique.

If you have any questions, send us a message on Reddit and we will get back to you!

**FAQ:**

**Do you have Discord for easier communication?**

* Yes, feel free to add me on Discord (PigeonsLB#8151) or join my server: [https://discord.gg/dTTbRd5rTT](https://discord.gg/dTTbRd5rTT)

**Do your POM plates work with all switches?**

* Yes, my plates work with all switches, including ones like Gateron Inks, which do not traditionally work with POM plates

**Can I use a half plate with a hotswap PCB?**

* No, I would highly recommend only using a half plate if your switches will be soldered in

**How much does shipping cost?**

* $5 US with First Class, $10 US with Priority Mail (International shipping prices are available on request)

**Why is one side of my POM plate white?**

* It just has a protective film, peel it off

**Do your POM plates have scratches/visual imperfections?**

* Yes, but my plates are cut on the backside, so the top has less imperfections than you would traditionally get on a POM plate. Regardless, all imperfections are purely cosmetic and can't be seen once built

**FAQ:**

**Do you have any other plates for sale?**

* Yes, I also have forged carbon fiber Gummy60 plates as well as POM plates for the Polaris (available for preorder in my Discord)

**Do you have Discord for easier communication?**

* Yes, feel free to add me on Discord (PigeonsLB#8151) or join my server: [https://discord.gg/dTTbRd5rTT](https://discord.gg/dTTbRd5rTT)

**Do your POM plates work with all switches?**

* Yes, my plates work with all switches, including ones like Gateron Inks, which do not traditionally work with POM plates

**Can I use a half plate with a hotswap PCB?**

* No, I would highly recommend only using a half plate if your switches will be soldered in

\---------------------

Shipping is $5 US with First Class, $10 US with Priority Mail (International shipping prices are available on request). POM plates will have small visual imperfections (such as microscratches and other marks), but none of these will be seen once the board is built :)

Hey everyone!

Looking to sell/trade my Fuji65 Founders Edition that I had recieved from the China GB. Please note that this is from the China GB, so any changes made recently to the design for the international GB aren't made on this model.

This board was built on stream and has lubed black inks on a full alu plate. The FE comes with the brass pvd kanji badge, SS bottom, PVD mountain weight, and an extra silver sakura badge. It comes with black durock stabs lubed with 205g0 and dielectric grease. 

Please note there are some minor flaws. When soldering the ""G"" key failed to work, so I desoldered it and retested. Somehow after desoldering it worked, so I just left it alone and since then there has been no issues. Also I believe that the backspace stab is not seated 100% flat, but everything is still functional. 

Everything else in the build is great, the SS is flawless and the overall board is quite nice. 

**I am looking for $450 + ship CONUS OBO**. I haven't seen much info about FE prices, so if you want to make an offer please do. It will ship in it's original packaging. Please note that the keycaps pictured are not included. If local to Boston a discount will be given. As far as trades go, I'm interested in anything and can add paypal on my end to even out the trade.

The base kit has been used for several days, along with the neon yellow 6.25 spacebar, and 3 of the novelty keys. They have no shine, and are like-new. I am parting ways with the set due to financial difficulties. Please shoot me a pm. I can be flexible on prices to an extent.

337,i7z,1617794930.0,/r/mechmarket/comments/mlzyzy/eude_h_gmk_plum_full_set_kbparadise_v60_type_r/,"Hey there,

Selling off a lot of my hoarded clacking gear since I've since found my endgame in the *Natec Roach* rubber dome.

Just kiddin', I have two HHKB Pro JP (one of which is Type-S), and those're the only two keyboards I use. In fact, every single item I'm selling today has been UNUSED, and is in NEW condition. Granted, some items have briefly left their box for taking pictures, but nothing I'm offering here has been touched for more than a minute or two (apart of course from time spent assembling in the Preonic's case).

Following are timestamps of the individual items along with my asking price and a short description for each of them.



First off, ***KEYBOARDS and KEY CAP SET***:

Item | Condition | Note | Timestamp | Price
----|---------|----|---------|-----
~~GMK Plum FULL key cap set~~ | ~~new, unused, in original packaging~~ | ~~This set has not yet come out of its packaging. It is the full set as can be seen [here](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/34848).~~ | ~~[timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/R4uenJw)~~ | ~~€170 (does not include shipping cost)~~ sold!
KBParadise V60 Type R with Cherry MX Clear switches | new, unused, in original packaging | Only taken out of its box to check if the LEDs were all working properly, and to take a picture. This is the limited edition version of the regular KBParadise V60, that has LEDs at the switches, as well as on the sides of the keyboard. Check out this video for a showcase of it in full glory [here](https://youtu.be/MclO0cLKOj4?t=427). | [timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/DJFXVQI) | €150 (does not include shipping cost)
~~Drop + OLKB Preonic Keyboard MX Kit Rev 3 (latest)~~ | ~~pre-assembled, new, unused~~ | ~~This keyboard has not been used after assembly. Anodized orange CNC-aluminum case. It has been installed with Bronze (clicky) Kaihua Kailh Speed Switches. I can optionally throw in a set of Cherry MX Blue switches that can be popped into the board without soldering, as the Preonic has a hot-swap PCB.~~ | ~~[timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/uuMnAyC)~~ | ~~€190 (does not include shipping cost)~~ sold!

Hey all,

Got a few things to get rid of today. USPS Shipping is included in all listed prices.

&#x200B;

|Product|Description|Price/Trades|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Epomaker GK68XS|BNIB; was sent out to me as a replacement for my old one that got replaced under warranty. Selling at a loss because it's clearly in stock and I want someone new to the community to try a nice prebuilt. Comes with Cherry Black switches, grey-white keycaps, and an aluminum base, which is a pretty premium feel for <$200. If you're curious, link of it (currently in stock for $189 before shipping) is [here](https://epomaker.com/collections/mini-64/products/epomaker-gk68xs?variant=31813865865289).|$160 ($150 barebones)|
|~~ThicThock Marshmallows x90~~ **SOLD**|~~Lubed with Krytox 205g0 (bag lube 105g0 on the springs) and filmed with Deskey films. Not all 90 are pictured because I forgot I had them in a KBD67 lite, so yes about half were mounted once, and I can send you an imgur photo with all 90 if you want.~~|~~$105~~|
|~~GMK Noel~~ **SOLD**|~~BNIB, just the base kit. Not really looking to sell (hence the high price), mostly want to trade for other GMK sets I've been longing for.~~|~~$300 $350, GMK Rudy, GMK Mizu, GMK Oblivion (preferably Git), GMK Dualshot, GMK Olive, maybe others??~~|

~~Keycaps are preferred BNIB and listed in order of preference but I'm open to used sets; if you want to PM and ask about whether I'd be down for this set or that set I'm sure I might've forgotten about or not known about some. Regardless of whether they're used or BNIB, I will be asking for pictures per the~~ r/mechmarket ~~timestamp rules.~~

~~Thanks everyone! Hope you find something you like.~~

~~EDIT: After realizing $300 is a joke of a price compared to what~~ r/mm ~~has been selling at I'm going to hike up the price. If you've already PM'ed me you can opt out, but if you still want Noel it is going to be FCFS and I will not be doing bidding/auctioning/OBO/anything of that sort.

Downsizing my collection. Brand new or used, I'm the first and only owner. Condition is clearly stated with close-up photos in timestamp to show condition. All items come with **original packaging and full set of accessories.**

Payment: All through **Paypal Goods and Services with service fee borne by me** for your peace of mind as it comes with buyer's protection, unless you specifically request other methods otherwise.

I **ship globally** to your residential country or to your Singapore forwarder address (I'm based in Singapore), shipping estimate:

1. Shipping to your Singapore forwarder address, less than 7 USD;
2. Shipping to your residential country:

a. Standard shipping (selective countries only) - **7-15 USD** for smaller items, **12-35 USD** for bigger items.

b. Express shipping - **25 USD onwards**; keyboard will be usually 50 **USD onwards (shipping within Asia will be cheaper)**. For goods value above 300 USD, I will only recommend to ship with Express option given faster turnaround and better point-to-point tracking. Combine multiple purchases to save on shipping as there's always a base weight charged.

# Updates

\- 210327 1610 I got started later than expected today. Sorry, and thank you for your patience, to those waiting for invoices. I will be sending them out all evening.

\- 210328 13:09 I sent the first round of invoices out yesterday evening and I've continued sending them today. Most people didn't ask for keyboard kits and their extras. It's taken longer to negotiate who gets what as a result. Sorry about the delay and thank you  for your patience.

\- 210328 17:05 I finished sending the first round of invoices earlier today. There are a few more pending sales than usual after some time. I'm guessing that half of them are going to back out and I'll send another round of invoices to the next buyers in line. I've crossed out what's been sold already above.

\- 210320 12:42 All of the first round of invoices have paid or backed out. There are buyers next in line for Prophet and Taro but they haven't been sent invoices yet (or they have and they've backed out also so the cycle is repeating). Most of the first round of sales have been shipped. A few are waiting to be collected, dropped off, and/or for contact details for tracking.

\- 210402 12:42 All of the items requested in the first rush of entries have been sold. I've been responding to later requests/entries as they've trickled in.",sold gmk calm depths assembly kit to /u/silverjs,"[UK] [H] Polaris, Prophet, Sirius, Klippe S, Ergonomic keyboards, Keycaps, Switches, Deskmats, and Artisans [W] PayPal"

Hello, r/mechmarket;

It's time to let go of my topre collection.

Prices are listed in GBP but I'll also accept EUR or USD.

I'll prefer UK > EU > Other buyers to reduce shipping costs and risks.

I will not undervalue items if I ship them internationally.

I'll prefer to sell cases (e.g. Norbaforce) with boards (e.g. Realforce R2) unless there are separate buyers for both parts.

These prices may seem high to international buyers. International shipping, import, handling, and PayPal fees add up quickly.

|Condition rating|Explanation|
|:-|:-|
|1|New / Unused|
|9.5|Like new / Used for display and/or testing only|
|.9|Like new / Used for a very short time only|

All topre board cases, except for the 87UB, have been carefully removed once.

Hello! Hope you guys are doing well!

I have some ramas up for sale today including the mizus. For the RAMA Mizu, the Navy GID version has been opened and mounted, but basically unmounted right after without use. The other 3 RAMAs (White Mizu, both Pono) are completely new and sealed.

I am looking to donate some cash from this sale to a local cat rescuer, can view her instagram at [.@fioloh](https://www.instagram.com/fioloh/?hl=en). She has been helping many stray cats/dogs (mainly cats) find homes, seek medical help (including surgeries) as well as helping to foster. I found her work really meaningful (especially because I like cats). Hence, I'll state 2 prices (just $10 difference), if you would like to help, you can opt to purchase the slightly more expensive price, it's perfectly okay if you don't want to. The donation will be publicly recorded at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asY5BAWSZ_pmxUy2jxmaSa1eHDddTiLQlEhGi1niuyw/edit#gid=1722981492), under tehbingg. (I hope this is allowed by the mods, otherwise please let me know, I'll be willing to remove.) Prior donations from previous sales have been made (can be seen in the spreadsheet).

I can provide more photos of the navy rama upon request:)

This would not be FCFS as I would like to prioritize the donation prices to help a little more.

*I forgot to take the Hyperglides off the table before I took the timestamp but they're not for sale, sorry about that.*

Norbatouch | $650 local, $700 shipped | Bought off [this nice person](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/mkwoc1/cabc_h_cm_novatouch_norbatouch_case_gmk/). Novatouch with KBDfans Silence X rings, Super Lube blend on stems and housing in anodized tactical black Norbatouch. I've always wanted to try a Norbatouch and it didn't disappoint but I don't have the space for this and can't justify keeping it. Selling for what I paid for it. Will come with all original packaging, accessories, plastic Novatouch case, and stock Novatouch keycaps. In like new condition but can provide additional photos upon request. **Add Susuwatari for $100.**
Klippe | $265 local, $295 shipped | Bought off [this nice person](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/mkyghi/usmah_klippe_t_r4_pc_ewhite_tray_mount_pcbs/). PC Klippe T R4 from 1upkeyboards with Instant60 Tsangan and Noxary 5mm PC plate. Additional photos of [machining marks and scuffs on Klippe here](https://imgur.com/a/ksBFmTn) and [Noxary plate here](https://imgur.com/a/0aO6JYr). Meant as a display piece but don't have space for it and also not really into WK 60% any more. Price is for case, PCB, and plate bundled. Will part out if buyers are found for all three items.
GMK Oblivion | ~~$250 local, $275 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Git base, purchased like new from somebody else on here. [Additional photos here.](https://imgur.com/a/6kdpJD3) Little to no shine all over, mounted for 2-3 months but no longer into GMK. Will ship in JTK trays.
GMK White on Black | ~~$90 local, $100 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Bought this locally off someone bundled with another board I bought. Unsure of what round this is but it's pretty shiny. Good beater or backup set more than anything.
MT3 Susuwatari | $100 local, $115 shipped | Base kit, purchased like new from someone else here to go on the Norbatouch but no longer needed since I'm departing with the Norba any way. **Priority goes to the person buying the Norbatouch.**
Salvun ICU keycap | $70 local or shipped | Bought this to go with GMK WoB but no longer needed since I'm selling.
90x Everglide Water Kings | ~~$50 local, $55 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Stock. Have not been mounted except for three which were mounted in a hotswap board to test feel. Selling for what I paid for them.
70x FFFs | $45 local, $55 shipped | Lubed with 205g0, 18x are filmed Deskey films but I received them mixed and so I'm unsure which ones are fimed.
Laser aviator cable | ~~$35 local, $45 shipped~~ **Sold!** | **The one with the blue heatshrinks.** Bought to go with ePBT Sushi and I thought it went really well together since it has blue connectors and is a lighter shade than other Laser-themed cables.
Laser YC-8 cable | ~~$45 local, $55 shipped~~ **Sold!** | **The one with the purple heatshrinks.** Bought from u/ThePrinkus, one of the nicer cables I've had the pleasure of trying. I paired this with the Laser R1 set and this shade works really well but just going another direction.
C3 translucent pink stabilizers | ~~$10 local or add-on shipped~~ **Sold!** | Thought I sold these in a previous post but found them hiding underneath some other stuff. Never used. Comes with 3 2u wires, 1 6.25u wire, **no 7u wire**, housings, screws, and washers.

Polaris | ~~$700 shipped, $650 local~~ **Sold!** | HHKB layout Polaris in black, built with 67g Tangies (205g0, Deskey films) and orange C3 stabs (V1, 205g0, dieletric) on brass with case and plate foam. Bought local already built by previous owner, I have not opened the board up myself. Great board, one of my favorites I've ever owned, but I'm back on TKL for good. Will come with one desoldered PCB, [Hype's full FR4 plate](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/lyhwmq/bulk_fr4_plates_for_vega_thinkv2_space65_d65/), another full FR4 plate, one POM WKL plate cut by [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/), and 24x gaskets from u/ThePanduuh. More information on the gaskets can be found in [their original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/mir2lq/uspah_artisans_brutal60_switches_polaris/). **Only splitting board and extras if buyers are found for everything. Priority goes to buyer with extras. GMK Oblivion (git base) not included but open to bundling.**
MGA Standard | ~~$300 shipped, $280 local~~ **Sold!** | Black, USB-C, alu plate, and MGA foam. Bought new from Sneakbox while trying out the Alice layout but just have too many keyboards and don't wanna have it sit so just looking to sell for what I paid for it. Still new, unopened in original packaging. This is basically a good deal if you're local or if you're shipping it, you're just doing me a favor and I appreciate you.
90x Sakurios | ~~$75 local, $85 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Stock, mounted and used once. A few bucks off because the legs were clipped by the previous owner so they could fit them into a three-pin hotswap PCB.
69x Everglide Moyu Blacks | ~~$60 local, $70 shipped~~ **Sold!** | *Very lightly* lubed with 3203, springs with GPL 105.
~~70x~~ 69x Penguins | ~~$55 local, $65 shipped~~ **Sold!** | 63.5g, comes with the extra 67g springs. 205g0 on housing and rails but not the legs, GPL 105 on springs, white Deskey films. Will come in Kinetic Labs bag.
70x MX Black Hyperglides | $55 local, $65 shipped | Lubed and filmed by previous owner, not sure with what though.
70x FFFs | $50 local, $60 shipped | Lubed with 205g0, 18x are filmed Deskey films but I received them mixed and so I'm unsure which ones are fimed.
70x Unholy Bobas | ~~$30 local, $35 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Bought these from u/Xenocult, they consist of the U4T stem in Halo Clear housings with the Halo Clear springs. Housing and stems lubed with 205g0, spring bag lubed with Super Lube 51004 all by Xenocult. In their words, *""To my surprise, the long stem length and short spring, made these miss the bump entirely. What I ended up with is a surprisingly smooth linear, akin to a yellow, with a more firm key press, and a tad quicker activation. Luckily, there's a hefty amount of thock still coming through due to the shape of the bottom of the stem.""* These are really cool, just not my speed.
47x Zeal Zilents | ~~$35 local, $40 shipped~~ **Sold!** | 67g, pretty sure these are stock.
Random switch parts | ~~**Free local pickup, $10 shipped or free bundled**~~ **Claimed!** | This consists of everything in the new timestamp below the MGA Standard, to the right of the Hyperglides, and right above the cables. It consists of a bag of clear top Panda housings, Kiwi stems, MX Clear springs, more springs (not sure what they are), and a bag of 48 stock Kailh Purples that came with a Minivan from awhile ago. I've been trying to sell these for a few bucks but now I figure these would be fun for someone trying out their hand at frankenswitching or switch modding in general.
Black on black PBT keycaps | ~~$30 local, $40 shipped~~ **Sold!** | Unsure of where these are from exactly, they are similar to the [dye-sub PBT set from KBDfans](https://kbdfans.com/products/black-dye-subbed-keycap-set?_pos=5&_sid=4531cd0b1&_ss=r), just without accents and without extended layout support. Will fit standard 60/65% layouts and TKL.
KPrepublic Korean black font dye subs | ~~$35 local, $45 shipped~~ **Sold!** | I believe this is the ""black Korean base"" and ""black Korean mod"" is you look up ""KPREPUBLIC 139 KOREAN ROOT BLACK FONT CHERRY PROFILE DYE SUB KEYCAP PBT"" on KPrepublic. Mounted once but mostly kept in bags since I received them.
Ducky Bon Voyage keycaps | ~~$20 local, $30 shipped~~ **Sold!** | [These ones.](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=5115) Bought from somebody else on mechmarket who harvested them from a Ducky keyboard of their own, was meant for a build for a friend but ended up not using them. Have been in a bag ever since.
KBParadise MX V80 keycaps | **Free local pickup, free shipped in bundle** | [These ones.](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=2141) I bought these a *loooooooong* time ago when I was first getting into the hobby several years ago and they got lost in my parents' garage. A nice alternative if you just want a slightly nicer looking ABS set on your parents' keyboard.
Laser aviator cable | $40 local, $50 shipped | **The one with the blue heatshrinks.** Bought to go with ePBT Sushi and I thought it went really well together since it has blue connectors and is a lighter shade than other Laser-themed cables.
Laser YC-8 cable | $50 local, $60 shipped | **The one with the purple heatshrinks.** Bought from u/ThePrinkus, one of the nicer cables I've had the pleasure of trying. I paired this with the Laser R1 set and this shade works really well but just going another direction.
Dark blue aviator cable | ~~**Free local pickup, free shipped in bundle**~~ **Claimed!** | I bought this cable from someone on the market a few months ago to go with a Striker build and I had it sitting in a box after I stopped using that build but for some apparent reason, it doesn't seem to work any more. Don't have the time or tools to fix it so it needs a home where someone can nurse it back to proper health.",bought gmk oblivion git base from u/ohwhatitsmeels,"[US-CA] [H] Black HHKB Polaris, Black MGA Standard, Lots of Switches, Budget Keycaps, Coiled Cables [W] Local Cash, PayPal"

**SOLD**

~~Want to trade or sell my Oblivion set with another GMK set. Not looking to split.~~

**~~What I have:~~**

~~GMK Oblivion v2 Git Base + Fixed mods kit + Hagoromo Cadet Alpha kit.~~

~~Git base kit has 3-4 keys that are starting to lose some of the GMK texture but I really can't find any shine. the 7u Spacebar might be the only one under a harsh light that you can see hint of a small shine. Only been typed on for about a week. Check the closet up photos.~~

~~Fixed Mods kit: Apparently they weren't happy with the legends alignment of some of the mod keys and sent out 'fixed' keys... but I honestly can't tell the difference.. basically you get extra mods  keys so yay.~~

~~Hagoromo Cadet kit was practically unused and still in like-new condition.~~

~~I prefer trades but if you must buy, I'm asking for $450 shipped CONUS.~~

Selling my GMK Laser r2 bundle, which includes the Cyberdeck base, spacebars, and novelties. Looking to sell together as a set to one buyer.

Base kit is not sealed. I did open the seal and slide the tray out to take a look. I didn't touch the keys and slid it right back inside. So, they're untouched and never mounted of course. Spacebar kit and novelties are both sealed.

I'm one of the (apparently many) people that was disappointed that this kit turned out more Orange Creamscicle than pastel peaches, so I've never touched the keys, they're BNIB (just took off the shrinkwrap to look at the keys, and then put it away :/)

In light of the designer running this kit a second time with (hopefully) lighter colors, I'm posting this at **$200 shipped** (via USPS) for those that want Peaches n Cream right now and/or like the more saturated tones of the OG version.

I've reached a point where my collection has extended beyond the reach of my Evil Box, so it's time to let some go.

Buyer pays shipping: $9 CONUS, sorry no international shipping at this time.

Most caps have been seated to ensure functionality. The Zen Pond II took three attempts for them to make and actually reach the stabilizers, so I had to make sure this final attempt worked properly. I'm happy to double check any before sending, otherwise buyer agrees to accept cap as is.

Smaller caps have been kept in an Evil Box on elegant display since I've received them, the larger two keys have remained in their wood foam lined artisan boxes except to take pictures.

Hi mechmarket!

Today I have some items that I don't use a lot these days and I want to cut down on clutter to prepare for a move. All these items have all seen some use from time to time but nothing too crazy with the exception of one item that I will disclose down below. All prices are OBO and has not taken shipping into account, and will subject to change if you guys deem it too out of line. I will only ship to CONUS at this time, thus making shipping cost around $20-35 if it's like $10 or so I won't charge you for it. I can also do local if you are local to 95131 or the Bay Area.

* **Black KCK KY-01 built with Holy Bobas lubed with 3204 + Extra PCB, Carbon Fiber Plate and Case Foam - Asking for $500**This used to be my endgame, it has great acoustics and sound but it doesn't get that much use nowadays. Ok full disclaimer there is some scratches on the PCB, Brass plate that is build with the Holy Bobas, once fully built you can't notice it unless you take in apart. This is purely a cosmetic defect that has no affect on the usability of the keyboard. Also this is bundled with extra pcb and plate in case you don't like it.
* **Polycarbonate Fanoe built with NK\_Blueberries lubed with 205g0 and PBT Keycaps - Asking for $200**I purchase this off mechmarket a while back but it has only been sitting on top of my shelf without much use so I'm letting it go to a better home. Disclaimer it came to me with one diode missing on the PCB and the seller had no idea of this so I fixed it by soldering in a diode that I have lying around and it works great!
* **~~Keychron K6 with Gateron Black lubed with 205g0 - Asking for $90~~**~~Not much to say about this one, I purchase it as a travel board but that never happened due to COVID and it has seen little to no use at home so I think that price is fair for what it is.~~ SOLD bundled with K6 for $150
* **Prime\_E with NK\_Silk Yellows + IFK 40% keycap set - Asking for $150**I bought it and used for a week in order to dip my toes into smaller form factor keyboards but never got used to it and been sitting on my shelf for a couple of months since.
* **~~MT3 White On Black - Asking for $90~~**~~Bought it and it never got used due to I couldn't get used to the high profile, only the qwer keys have been mount the rest haven't mounted whatsoever.~~  PENDING FOR A LOCAL TRADE.
* **EPBT Kuro/Shiro (Base + JP Mod Kit + Icon Mod kit) - Asking for $250**Bought it during the GB in May of 2020 but my taste have changed since so I'm selling it with the pricing based on recent posts.
* **~~OSA Sleeves - Asking for $60~~**~~Again never used due to the high profile, I thought I could use it due to it being slightly lower than normal SAs and MT3 but that didn't go well, only mounted the alphas to type for 5 minutes or so.~~ SOLD bundled with K6 for $150

EDIT: Prime E bundle and Kuro Shiro has been SOLD

That's everything I have now, I am busy with packing nowadays so once purchased give me a couple of days to pack and set aside my other stuff and will ship it as soon as I can.

Sup Kings and Queens, 

I have a couple of things sitting at home that deserve better than me. Turns out, I keep going back to my Polaris time and again. 

~~**Blurple Voice65 - $650**~~ **SOLD FOR $635**
> ~~*Solder version. NOT HOTSWAP. Built with nicely lubed Vint MX Blacks bought here from another user, with dampeners and all installed, and some excellent stab work if I do say so myself. I think the board feels great as is, but with a bit more break-in, its probably a top lad in the making. Normally I'd offer to desolder the thing if you really wanted but realistically I just straight up do not have the time pls forgive. Comes with extra solder PCB, and alu plate. Comes with original box and stuff ofc. There is a tiny nick on the left edge towards the bottom. Pic included.*~~


~~**GMK Olivia++ Light Base - $310**~~ **SOLD FOR ASKING**

> ~~*I put them on a board for like a week and realized it wasn't really a good match. Not really any significant signs of use or shine. Comes in original box. I mean, its Olivia, what more can I type?*~~

A couple of notes:

Sale is **not FCFS.** I like to sell to people who have some rep or are nice to talk to. Prices are inclusive of shipping via UPS (to US only) and PayPal G&S fees. I'm open to reasonable offers. I'll ship the items once everything is sold.

Not really looking for trades unless you're getting rid of a nice Alpinist or Max Bill Auto. But really, money is better. 

As always, please leave a pm here before messaging me, I'll get back to you as fast as I can. 

Thanks luv.",sold gmk olivia++ to u/dimarzogatto,"[US-PA][H] Blurple Voice65 w/ Vint Blacks with extras, GMK Olivia++ Light Base [W] PayPal"

Howdy pardner, 

I am selling my Polaris. I have three of them in the house between my gf and I, and I figure that's one too many. I don't want to sell the HHKB layout one because its my favorite, but I have like, 4 HHKB style boards. So... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

**[Here is a sound demo, you are buying literally this keyboard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCHZWz4bQP8)**

**Build:** Grey HHKB layout. Soldered with lubed and well worn Yok Holy Pandas. Brass plate. With all the foam and noise dampening inserts. 

**Comes in:** original box, with tools for disassembly.

**Some answers:** 

1. Yes, those are drop holy pandas on the control and spacebar. Why? For some reason, the yok switch on the spacebar sounded ungodly loud compared to the rest of the board. Some people have said its due to the size of the stem. I'm not sure, but after testing back and forth, I found the drop panda to sound better. You'll never see them with the caps on anyways, and you can just, you know.... put ur own switches on it. 

2. Most of the board is basically in great shape. [However, There are some scratches and wear on the weight. You can see it.](https://imgur.com/a/DAT5m2x) It's there. Its all my fault. I'm sorry. *It's what I get for using this keyboard so much.*

**Asking: $550 shipped OBO** **SOLD for $500**

\*\*\* FOR SALE \*\*\*

\------------------------------------------------

~~\*\*\* RAMA M65-B ICED \*\*\*~~

~~Brand new unbuilt kit, opened to check and to take photos. The sale comes with Moon PVD Brass Plate, Hotswap PCB (tweezer-tested), Internal Dampener, and all OG accessories.~~

~~Two things to note:~~

1. ~~Please note that the unit has the machine marks on the inside of the bottom case~~ [~~as mentioned from RAMA~~](https://rama.works/updates/2021/3/16/m65-b-iced-bases-and-wave-seq2-br-keycaps)~~. They cannot be seen once assembled, especially if you use either the internal dampener or internal weight. Don't expect to get one without these marks. They are minor and consistent with imperfection with most inner cases.~~
2. ~~One of the~~ [~~M3-6 RAMA's fasterners~~](https://ramaworks.store/products/rw-fastener-kit-assorted) ~~for the case is missing and was replaced with a~~ [~~regular black Phillip head screws~~](https://imgur.com/XbX9VZp)~~. My other M65-B is missing all 6 of them. I am asking for replacement and will send it to the buyer once it's received.~~

~~So for those of you buying a sealed kit, do expect the above issues and be sure to communicate with the sellers to procure replacements if possible.~~

&#x200B;

\*\*\* [E7-V1 Purple](https://imgur.com/a/gJk0Yuw) (EVA-01) \*\*\*

Brand new unbuilt Purple E7-V1 with new green alu plate, new PCB, and new eYellow SE weight. The PCB has been fully tested and flashed with the VIA firmware. The board is flawless and have never been built as aforementioned. The ano matching is not perfect but close, none of these top/bottom cases boards is.

There is no official EVA-01 version but the green plate and the eYellow weight as an accent make it perfect! The purple is really nice as you can see the different tones from different lighting in the pictures. Click above for detail pictures.

Please note that there were only 100 alum slots in the OG GB and I bet most of them were not purple. The SE version was eYellow only.

\*\*\* FOR SALE \*\*\*

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

~~\*\*\* RAMA M65-B ICED \*\*\*~~

~~Brand new unbuilt kit, opened to check and to take photos. The sale comes with Moon PVD Brass Plate, Hotswap PCB (tweezer-tested), Internal Dampener, and all OG accessories.~~

~~Two things to note:~~

1. ~~Please note that the unit has the machine marks on the inside of the bottom case~~ [~~as mentioned from RAMA~~](https://rama.works/updates/2021/3/16/m65-b-iced-bases-and-wave-seq2-br-keycaps)~~. They cannot be seen once assembled, especially if you use either the internal dampener or internal weight. Don't expect to get one without these marks. They are minor and consistent with imperfection with most inner cases.~~
2. ~~One of the~~ [~~M3-6 RAMA's fasterners~~](https://ramaworks.store/products/rw-fastener-kit-assorted) ~~for the case is missing and was replaced with a~~ [~~regular black Phillip head screws~~](https://imgur.com/XbX9VZp)~~. My other M65-B is missing all 6 of them. I am asking for replacement and will send it to the buyer once it's received.~~

~~So for those of you buying a sealed kit, do expect the above issues and be sure to communicate with the sellers to procure replacements if possible.~~

&#x200B;

~~- Asking $1000 + insured shipping (10% via Zelle or local cash pickup)~~

~~\*PENDING LOCAL DEAL~~

\------------------------------------------------

\*\*\* [E7-V1 Purple](https://imgur.com/a/gJk0Yuw) (EVA-01) \*\*\*

Brand new unbuilt Purple E7-V1 with new green alu plate, new PCB, and new eYellow SE weight. The PCB has been fully tested and flashed with the VIA firmware. The board is flawless and have never been built as aforementioned. The ano matching is not perfect but close, none of these top/bottom cases boards is.

There is no official EVA-01 version but the green plate and the eYellow weight as an accent make it perfect! The purple is really nice as you can see the different tones from different lighting in the pictures. Click above for detail pictures.

Please note that there were only 100 alum slots in the OG GB and I bet most of them were not purple. The SE version was eYellow only.

\- Asking $850 + insured shipping (10% via Zelle or local cash pickup)

~~\*\*\* RAMA M65-B ICED \*\*\*~~

~~Brand new unbuilt kit, opened to check and to take photos. The sale comes with Moon PVD Brass Plate, Hotswap PCB (tweezer-tested), Internal Dampener, and all OG accessories.~~

~~Two things to note:~~

1. ~~Please note that the unit has the machine marks on the inside of the bottom case~~ [~~as mentioned from RAMA~~](https://rama.works/updates/2021/3/16/m65-b-iced-bases-and-wave-seq2-br-keycaps)~~. They cannot be seen once assembled, especially if you use either the internal dampener or internal weight. Don't expect to get one without these marks. They are minor and consistent with imperfection with most inner cases.~~
2. ~~One of the~~ [~~M3-6 RAMA's fasterners~~](https://ramaworks.store/products/rw-fastener-kit-assorted) ~~for the case is missing and was replaced with a~~ [~~regular black Phillip head screws~~](https://imgur.com/XbX9VZp)~~. My other M65-B is missing all 6 of them. I am asking for replacement and will send it to the buyer once it's received.~~

~~So for those of you buying a sealed kit, do expect the above issues and be sure to communicate with the sellers to procure replacements if possible.~~

\*\*\* [E7-V1 Purple](https://imgur.com/a/gJk0Yuw) (EVA-01) \*\*\*

Brand new unbuilt Purple E7-V1 with new green alu plate, new PCB, and new eYellow SE weight. The PCB has been fully tested and flashed with the VIA firmware. The board is flawless and have never been built as aforementioned. The ano matching is not perfect but close, none of these top/bottom cases boards is.

There is no official EVA-01 version but the green plate and the eYellow weight as an accent make it perfect! The purple is really nice as you can see the different tones from different lighting in the pictures. Click above for detail pictures.

Please note that there were only 100 alum slots in the OG GB and I bet most of them were not purple. The SE version was eYellow only.

# Updates

\- 210327 1610 I got started later than expected today. Sorry, and thank you for your patience, to those waiting for invoices. I will be sending them out all evening.

\- 210328 13:09 I sent the first round of invoices out yesterday evening and I've continued sending them today. Most people didn't ask for keyboard kits and their extras. It's taken longer to negotiate who gets what as a result. Sorry about the delay and thank you  for your patience.

\- 210328 17:05 I finished sending the first round of invoices earlier today. There are a few more pending sales than usual after some time. I'm guessing that half of them are going to back out and I'll send another round of invoices to the next buyers in line. I've crossed out what's been sold already above.

\- 210320 12:42 All of the first round of invoices have paid or backed out. There are buyers next in line for Prophet and Taro but they haven't been sent invoices yet (or they have and they've backed out also so the cycle is repeating). Most of the first round of sales have been shipped. A few are waiting to be collected, dropped off, and/or for contact details for tracking.

\- 210402 12:42 All of the items requested in the first rush of entries have been sold.

~~Hi~~ r/mechmarket\~\~, I have 110x Stock Light Green (62g) Tangerines for sale.\~\~

~~Yes I am aware that Tangerines are back in stock on Ilumkb but the 62g variant has already sold out and the cheapest shipping option has an ETA of around 3 weeks. Not looking to make a profit but bought from here for about $86 a month ago and was lucky enough to get some Dark Green Tangerines from the TKC restock a couple weeks ago and would rather keep the 100x I bought from there than the 110x here. 100 switches just seems like a more even number to keep if that makes any sense lol. Shipping with USPS and ETA is roughly a week. DOES NOT INCLUDE JAR IN TIMESTAMP.~~

\*\*\* FOR SALE \*\*\*

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

~~\*\*\* RAMA M65-B ICED \*\*\*~~

~~Brand new unbuilt kit, opened to check and to take photos. The sale comes with Moon PVD Brass Plate, Hotswap PCB (tweezer-tested), Internal Dampener, and all OG accessories.~~

~~Two things to note:~~

1. ~~Please note that the unit has the machine marks on the inside of the bottom case~~ [~~as mentioned from RAMA~~](https://rama.works/updates/2021/3/16/m65-b-iced-bases-and-wave-seq2-br-keycaps)~~. They cannot be seen once assembled, especially if you use either the internal dampener or internal weight. Don't expect to get one without these marks. They are minor and consistent with imperfection with most inner cases.~~
2. ~~One of the~~ [~~M3-6 RAMA's fasterners~~](https://ramaworks.store/products/rw-fastener-kit-assorted) ~~for the case is missing and was replaced with a~~ [~~regular black Phillip head screws~~](https://imgur.com/XbX9VZp)~~. My other M65-B is missing all 6 of them. I am asking for replacement and will send it to the buyer once it's received.~~

~~So for those of you buying a sealed kit, do expect the above issues and be sure to communicate with the sellers to procure replacements if possible.~~

&#x200B;

~~- Asking $1000 + insured shipping (10% via Zelle or local cash pickup)~~

\*\*\* [E7-V1 Purple](https://imgur.com/a/gJk0Yuw) (EVA-01) \*\*\*

Brand new unbuilt Purple E7-V1 with new green alu plate, new PCB, and new eYellow SE weight. The PCB has been fully tested and flashed with the VIA firmware. The board is flawless and have never been built as aforementioned. The ano matching is not perfect but close, none of these top/bottom cases boards is.

There is no official EVA-01 version but the green plate and the eYellow weight as an accent make it perfect! The purple is really nice as you can see the different tones from different lighting in the pictures. Click above for detail pictures.

Please note that there were only 100 alum slots in the OG GB and I bet most of them were not purple. The SE version was eYellow only.

\*\*\* FOR SALE \*\*\*

\------------------------------------------------

~~\*\*\* RAMA M65-B ICED \*\*\*~~

~~Brand new unbuilt kit, opened to check and to take photos. The sale comes with Moon PVD Brass Plate, Hotswap PCB (tweezer-tested), Internal Dampener, and all OG accessories.~~

~~Two things to note:~~

1. ~~Please note that the unit has the machine marks on the inside of the bottom case~~ [~~as mentioned from RAMA~~](https://rama.works/updates/2021/3/16/m65-b-iced-bases-and-wave-seq2-br-keycaps)~~. They cannot be seen once assembled, especially if you use either the internal dampener or internal weight. Don't expect to get one without these marks. They are minor and consistent with imperfection with most inner cases.~~
2. ~~One of the~~ [~~M3-6 RAMA's fasterners~~](https://ramaworks.store/products/rw-fastener-kit-assorted) ~~for the case is missing and was replaced with a~~ [~~regular black Phillip head screws~~](https://imgur.com/XbX9VZp)~~. My other M65-B is missing all 6 of them. I am asking for replacement and will send it to the buyer once it's received.~~

~~So for those of you buying a sealed kit, do expect the above issues and be sure to communicate with the sellers to procure replacements if possible.~~

\*\*\* [E7-V1 Purple](https://imgur.com/a/gJk0Yuw) (EVA-01) \*\*\*

Brand new unbuilt Purple E7-V1 with new green alu plate, new PCB, and new eYellow SE weight. The PCB has been fully tested and flashed with the VIA firmware. The board is flawless and have never been built as aforementioned. The ano matching is not perfect but close, none of these top/bottom cases boards is.

There is no official EVA-01 version but the green plate and the eYellow weight as an accent make it perfect! The purple is really nice as you can see the different tones from different lighting in the pictures. Click above for detail pictures.

Please note that there were only 100 alum slots in the OG GB and I bet most of them were not purple. The SE version was eYellow only.

Looking to get rid of a keycap set that came off a board I picked up on here a while ago. Minimal use as I swapped off the caps when I got the board as I didn’t like the profile. I don’t know too much about what keyset this exactly is but feel free to chime in what it is if you do know. 

Looking to get $40 shipped for it. Will be shipped in bag pictured as I don’t have the tray for them. If any questions feel free to ask. Thanks!

Hello! Hope you guys are doing well!

I have some ramas up for sale today. All 3 ramas are new and sealed.

I am looking to donate some cash from this sale to a local cat rescuer, can view her instagram at [.@fioloh](https://www.instagram.com/fioloh/?hl=en). She has been helping many stray cats/dogs (mainly cats) find homes, seek medical help (including surgeries) as well as helping to foster. I found her work really meaningful (especially because I like cats). Hence, I'll state 2 prices (just $10 difference), if you would like to help, you can opt to purchase the slightly more expensive price, it's perfectly okay if you don't want to. The donation will be publicly recorded at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asY5BAWSZ_pmxUy2jxmaSa1eHDddTiLQlEhGi1niuyw/edit#gid=1722981492), under tehbingg. (I hope this is allowed by the mods, otherwise please let me know, I'll be willing to remove.) Prior donations from previous sales have been made (can be seen in the spreadsheet).

I can provide more photos of the ramas upon request:)

This would not be FCFS as I would like to prioritize the donation prices to help a little more.

\*\*\* FOR SALE \*\*\*

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

~~\*\*\* RAMA M65-B ICED \*\*\*~~

~~Brand new unbuilt kit, opened to check and to take photos. The sale comes with Moon PVD Brass Plate, Hotswap PCB (tweezer-tested), Internal Dampener, and all OG accessories.~~

~~Two things to note:~~

1. ~~Please note that the unit has the machine marks on the inside of the bottom case~~ [~~as mentioned from RAMA~~](https://rama.works/updates/2021/3/16/m65-b-iced-bases-and-wave-seq2-br-keycaps)~~. They cannot be seen once assembled, especially if you use either the internal dampener or internal weight. Don't expect to get one without these marks. They are minor and consistent with imperfection with most inner cases.~~
2. ~~One of the~~ [~~M3-6 RAMA's fasterners~~](https://ramaworks.store/products/rw-fastener-kit-assorted) ~~for the case is missing and was replaced with a~~ [~~regular black Phillip head screws~~](https://imgur.com/XbX9VZp)~~. My other M65-B is missing all 6 of them. I am asking for replacement and will send it to the buyer once it's received.~~

~~So for those of you buying a sealed kit, do expect the above issues and be sure to communicate with the sellers to procure replacements if possible.~~

&#x200B;

\*\*\* [E7-V1 Purple](https://imgur.com/a/gJk0Yuw) (EVA-01) \*\*\*

Brand new unbuilt Purple E7-V1 with new green alu plate, new PCB, and new eYellow SE weight. The PCB has been fully tested and flashed with the VIA firmware. The board is flawless and have never been built as aforementioned. The ano matching is not perfect but close, none of these top/bottom cases boards is.

There is no official EVA-01 version but the green plate and the eYellow weight as an accent make it perfect! The purple is really nice as you can see the different tones from different lighting in the pictures. Click above for detail pictures.

Please note that there were only 100 alum slots in the OG GB and I bet most of them were not purple. The SE version was eYellow only.

~~Hi~~ r/mechmarket\~\~, I have 110x Stock Light Green (62g) Tangerines for sale.\~\~

~~Yes I am aware that Tangerines are back in stock on Ilumkb but the 62g variant has already sold out and the cheapest shipping option has an ETA of around 3 weeks. Not looking to make a profit but bought from here for about $86 a month ago and was lucky enough to get some Dark Green Tangerines from the TKC restock a couple weeks ago and would rather keep the 100x I bought from there than the 110x here. 100 switches just seems like a more even number to keep if that makes any sense lol. Shipping with USPS and ETA is roughly a week. DOES NOT INCLUDE JAR IN TIMESTAMP.~~

The KBD67MKII V2 Black PC Hotswap Bundle is perfect for anyone who wants a good quality entry level keyboard. Comes with the hotswap PCB and 3 different types of plates (the FR4 and POM plate don't have standoffs, which is totally fine). Although it is pricier than other entry level keyboards like the NK65ee or the KBD67Lite, the quality of this keyboard is far superior to the 2 keyboards. I am selling this bundled with GMK Cafe base, and will be shipped in the KBD67Lite carrying case and coiled cable. It's pretty much everything you need to build a keyboard :)

All prices include shipping (priced based on the market); not splitting bundle! Comment before PM please (no chats). Thanks!

Since it's been so long, I'm not sure what the names of these GID bots are. Also, since these caps are one of the first caps that Bro made before using the ID system, they don't come with ID cards. As far as I can guess, these are what I think the caps are from photos online and what caps I can remember I collected.

-Rama U80-A Kuro with lots of extras $1000 SOLD

I'd prefer to sell this locally/for pickup in the Bay Area, zip code 95014. Otherwise, buyer is responsible for fees and shipping. So this was my dream board when I was still into caps, but immediately after building it, I realized it wasn't this super awesome experience I was hoping for. Not saying that the board isn't great. Rama makes a lot of high quality items. Maybe it's the switches or whatever the case may be, I just don't have the time to look into how I could perfect it.

Hello mm, 

today I am trying something new: if you get a bundle then you can pick a cap from the free stuff, if you get two bundles then you can pick three caps from the free stuff and if you get three bundles then you can pick five caps from the free stuff and that until all the free caps have been claimed.

Shipping is free in the CONUS and the actual cost for the rest of the world.

I won't split bundles, I will ignore questions about the free stuff or offers from redditors with 0 confirmed trades. I will also ignore chat requests or discord friend requests. Sorry about all that ignoring, just trying to make my life marginally easier.

Regarding the Mulders v3, I don't care about the colorway, nor to get dups as long as they are in as good condition as the caps below are.

The KBD67MKII V2 Black PC Hotswap Bundle is perfect for anyone who wants a good quality entry level keyboard. Comes with the hotswap PCB and 3 different types of plates (the FR4 and POM plate don't have standoffs, which is totally fine). Although it is pricier than other entry level keyboards like the NK65ee or the KBD67Lite, the quality of this keyboard is far superior to the 2 keyboards. I am selling this bundled with GMK Cafe base, and will be shipped in the KBD67Lite carrying case and coiled cable. It's pretty much everything you need to build a keyboard :)

All prices include shipping (priced based on the market); not splitting bundle! Comment before PM please (no chats). Thanks!

This is my first time posting to Mechmarket. I am selling three items that haven't gotten much use lately.

**GMK Oblivion Assembly V2 / Ortholinear / Ergodox ~~($140)~~:** ***Sold!***

This is a like new set of keycaps for ortholinear keyboards. I only used the keycaps for a couple of weeks. I can ship this with or without the box. Shipping without the box will have a small price reduction.

**Keyboardio Atreus w/Case ~~($130)~~**  ***Sold!***

The Atreus has Speed Copper switches. This was one of the first production runs of the Atreus. Works great! I only used it for a month or so and did exchange the switches. As a warning, I did bend a couple of the switch prongs in the process, but everything works fine.

One of the drawbacks of the first run was the keycaps and their labels ""wear"" away rather quickly, or they look dirty. See image of the ""Shift"" keycap.


**Iris V2.1 (~~$10~~)** ***Sold!***

This Iris was the first keyboard I worked on. The soddering isn't great. I went through three pro-micros but the usb connection kept comming off. It has been awhile since I used this keyboard, but everything worked. The pro-micros just need to be replaced. I will also include the cable that connects the two halves.

The switches are Greetech Brown.

The KBD67MKII V2 Black PC Hotswap Bundle is perfect for anyone who wants a good quality entry level keyboard. Comes with the hotswap PCB and 3 different types of plates (the FR4 and POM plate don't have standoffs, which is totally fine). Although it is pricier than other entry level keyboards like the NK65ee or the KBD67Lite, the quality of this keyboard is far superior to the 2 keyboards. I am selling this bundled with GMK Cafe base, and will be shipped in the KBD67Lite carrying case and coiled cable. It's pretty much everything you need to build a keyboard :)

All prices include shipping (priced based on the market); not splitting bundle! Comment before PM please (no chats). Thanks!

Hi everyone, Aaron again from heebie keebies! I've got another batch of Aqua Kings from Everglide; this time, they are available in weights of 62g and 67g. I'll be running this sale on my new Shopify website! This should help streamline the purchasing process for everyone.

For the uninitiated, these switches have been making 𝔀𝓪𝓿𝓮𝓼 in the community recently. Their completely clear housing makes them ideal for those looking to use them in keyboards with RGB! This, in combination with how buttery smooth they are, makes them an ideal switch for all. So much so that Theremingoat has 𝓬𝓻𝓸𝔀𝓷𝓮𝓭 them with an [86/100](https://www.theremingoat.com/blog/everglide-v3-water-king-switch-review), rating them far higher than Lavenders, Banana Splits, OA switches, and Durock POMs; this puts them in the same neighborhood as the coveted Alpaca v2's. Ride this wave before they're all gone! Don't trust me? No worries. A member of our community, swirle13, has [made a fantastic sound test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X3KaxPp4TI) for them versus Gateron Black Inks. Give it a listen!

\_\_\_

I'll be doing another giveaway! Once again, this giveaway is available to CONUS only.

For the giveaway, I will be using redditraffler! The winner will be able to pick either 100 62g or 67g switches. Here are the rules:

1. Comment your favorite switch of all time below!
2. Account age must be at least 30 days.
3. All entrants must have at least 50 karma.
4. Each person is allowed a single entry.
5. Giveaway will last until 12:00 a.m. PDT **4/29**.

~~CONUS only.~~

~~I'm moving in a month, so everything listed here really ought to go. Therefore,~~ **~~prices are OBO. Prices also include shipping~~**~~. Priority and slight discount for bundles. Large preference for bundles including IMK +PCBs or all O++ kits. Everything bought on 4/14 or 4/15 will ship out in the morning on 4/16. I will be gone for the weekend beginning 4/16 and will respond on Monday, 4/19. Comment before PM.~~

~~Also willing to trade anything here towards a navy blue Fallacy or red Tengu.~~

&#x200B;

**~~Keycaps~~**

~~Both Olivia keycap sets were used in rotation with other boards for 2-3 months each. I really don't see any shine, but the texture has begun to wear off on the gamer keys, especially on the light set. All keycaps have been mounted and dismounted multiple times when changing switches. Priority goes to larger bundles. Prefer to sell the light kit with the child kits since they were stored together.~~

Kinda over GMK sets honestly, ABS sounds super mediocre and shines. The Polaris blew my socks off so I'm trying to get more boards of that quality or better. 

All prices include shipping to CONUS, and more pictures/details can be provided.  

#Stuff I want to sell 
* ~~~87x BSUN translucent holy pandas. Built with BSUN transparent panda housings, Halo true stems, and 62g springs, and have not been modified in any way outside of that. I can also lube them for a little more.~~

* GMK Ursa base
* GMK Metaverse R2 base 
* ~~GMK Noel base~~ 
* GMK Olivia++ light and spacebars. Base has never been mounted, only various 2u spacebars have been used. *Hard* trade
* Scuffed PC Uni660. Fully wireless, split, 660 layout in PC, built with 62g L/F Creams. PC is cracked in like 6 places and one of the case screw holes doesn't work, but it sounds excellent with burger mount and the stainless steel weights. 
* Orange alps 60% build. Orange alps have been ultrasonically cleaned, paper modded, spring swapped with 40g Sprit springs (can replace with original springs), and currently in a plastic case w/ foam. Built on a steel plate on a Voyager60 pcb, and flashed with VIA. Comes with a full set of ultrasonically cleaned AEK2 keycaps, as well as a set of M0116 keycaps. Alps are definitely the best tactile I have ever used, but I'm kinda getting over tactiles in general tbh.

White OEM PBT Blanks (104 keys) + RGB mods| $15 | Got these forever ago, and IIRC they're not shiny, but have lost their texture. The RGB mods are IKBC double shot PBT, and I'm bundling these together because these have been sitting in my closet for ages

Item | Price UK **Shipped** | Info | Status

~~YMDK Wings Kit~~ | ~~£110~~ | ~~Grey, brand new, comes with everything in the timestamp which is what I received, box opened only to check the kit, tiny scratch and discolouration mark on the bottom of the back can be seen in the album  **[ALBUM](https://imgur.com/a/2J71SKi)**~~  | **SOLD**  
Cooler Master SK630 | £35 | Bought used from eBay to try Low profile cherry switches, only used for a few weeks myself | **Available**  
~~KBDFans Tofu 60~~ | ~~£90~~ | ~~PC plate, cherry clipped and lubed stabs, gateron blues. Wrapped with a wood grain style wrap, the wrap is not perfect by any means, I cut the wrap lazily as did not think I would sell this board. The overall finish looks good when using the board, but you can see the way the corners etc are done in the album. It is more than likely the Rose gold case underneath was scratched during the process. This board would be good for someone who wants the look for a wooden 60% with the weight of an aluminium board. It looks [pretty good with keycaps on](https://i.imgur.com/vAbCOlz.jpeg). Would also be good for someone who wants to get a tofu custom coated/sprayed~~ | **SOLD** 
~~GMK 9009 R2~~ | ~~£130~~ | ~~Base kit 161 keys. I do not remember using this set much since I got it a few years ago, so it's only lightly used~~ | **SOLD** 
~~EnjoyPBT JP~~ | ~~£75~~ | ~~Used for a few weeks, mods never used. Includes extra ISO 5 Key set~~ | **SOLD** 
XDA Canvas style keycaps | £45 | Never used | **Pending** 
~~HK Gaming Milkshake~~ | ~~£35~~ | ~~Used for around 3 weeks~~ | **SOLD** 
~~Zeal Zilents 78g~~ | ~~£60~~ | ~~90 switches. These are lubed but I am really not sure what I lubed them with, possibly 105~~ | **SOLD**
