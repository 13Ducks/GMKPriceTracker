Hi everyone!
Sorry for the little updates in the past month, but I have some updates.

* I've ordered samples from ePBT to start the color match process with pantone colors.
* Still working for finalizing kits. Most kits are ok, I have to work on a kit that I'm still not sure about. When kitting is finalized I will get new renders with updated kits.
  I have to thank konstantin, 40s discord and Keycap Designers discord for the help with kitting.
* I have a collaboration with NerdCables for some Grand Tour themed cables.

My hopes are to be able to finalize the kits and then fix a gb date.

~~Spring~~ Winter cleaning is upon us! Have a few great boards for you in this post:

1.	~~Cannonkeys Chimera65 Gray/Lilac | This is an A-stock, _flawless_ Chimera65 with gaskets and bumpons already installed in the chassis. PCB is still _sealed_, comes with brass plate, fr4 plate, and aftermarket aluminum half-plate made by u/PigeonsLikeBread. 2.5mm hex screwdriver and CK carrying case are included. Ships in original CK shipping box. Asking for $1635 shipped~~ **SOLD for 1600 bundled with the Volt-80**

2.	~~Cannonkeys Satisfaction75 Navy | You have probably heard of the Satisfaction75. This one is round 1, number 144 of 250. Navy blue anodized with white enamel color-filled Cannonkeys logo. This is _not_ a perfect specimen, please check the imgur album above for more details. Everything that needs to function, does function: cleanly desoldered PCB, OLED, encoder with gold standard knob. Comes with factory bead-blasted brass plate, aftermarket POM plate with universal compatibility (split L-shift and split spacebar), CK soft case, and authenticity card. Does not include keycaps, keyswitches, or a battery for the real-time clock. Ideal board for a daily driver! Asking for $1440 shipped.~~ **SOLD for asking**

3.	~~Excluisve (now Exclusive) E7V1 E-White | Exquisite exterior; I can’t find any flaws in the e-white coating at all. Brass weight is internal mount, polished and clearcoated. There are some superficial scratches in the clearcoat on the weight. Factory plate is matching polished & clearcoated brass, and an extra polycarbonate full plate is along for the ride. PCB is desoldered with FR-301 and in very good shape with no pad damage. You can tell that this was a transition period for Excluisve’s name because one side of the PCB says “Excluisve” and the other “Exclusive”. Friendly 75% layout with 9 RGB LEDs on top to drive the accent above the arrow cluster. Top mount, mini-USB, QMK/VIA compatible. Asking for $750 shipped.~~ **SOLD for asking**

4.	~~Percent Studio Canoe Gen2 Svart, 2 builds | This is probably the brightest per-key RGB board I’ve ever seen. There are two builds: (a) Everglide Sakuras (JTK linears) lubed on a brushed silver aluminum plate with lubed C3 stabilizers, and (b) Zealios V1 62g lubed on a purple anodized brushed aluminum plate with lubed Durock stabilizers. Colorway is black top/bottom with silver badge and LED accents, as well as an e-orange accent mid-layer. Half-gasket mount (bottom only), USB-C QMK/VIA compatible._Keycaps not included._~~ **REPOSTED**

5.	~~TX75v2 Dark Grey built w/OG Milky Top Tangerines (V1.5?) | [Sound Check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m1J8joqJvc) | Heavy-duty workhorse 75% board. Sandwich mount, brushed brass plate, but with the sound of these 3204-lubed OG tangies, you’d never know. Screw-in PCB-mount lubed GMK stabs, RGB sideglow, and a huge brass bottom weight. Case foam for some dampening. Heavy as heck at 3.1kg (same as the TX87v2!). Excellent condition with flawless anodizing. USB-C connector. Comes with two spare switches.~~ **REPOSTED**

6.	~~Percent Studio Volt-80 TKL | Winkeyless TKL with an extra two keys on the F-row. Cerakoted in Glacier Black because I wasn’t a fan of the original Mango, it’s a deep matte fingerprint magnet, but what a beautiful fingerprint magnet it is! Rear accent plate has been left E-white. PCB has Kailh hotswap sockets and per-key RGB along with a Matrix-like RGB accent above the arrow cluster. USB-C and Bluetooth capable, though you’d need to buy a battery (these did not ship with batteries). Integral plate and top case, dampening mat between plate and PCB already installed. Comes with lubed stabs, no switches, no keycaps, in original box. Asking for $630 shipped~~ **SOLD for $576 shipped bundled with Chimera65**

7.	~~WASD V2 104-key Full-size | Originally a Cherry Brown board, now a lubed Cherry Red board with Gateron Yellow on the spacebar and a few Gateron Black on the F-row. This board makes a great beater, or a soldering/desoldering practice board: the PCB pads are almost impossible to overheat, and the PCB lifts away from the plate once all switch pins have been hit with a desoldering gun. Costar plate-mount stabs included. If you want cheap keycaps for this, I have some available to make a complete board.~~ **REPOSTED**

~~Spring~~ Winter cleaning is ongoing! Here's what's on offer for today:

1.	**Duck Octagon V3 black bundle** | The most compact a 75% can get, with super-thin bezels. This package includes more than everything you might want: three plates (aluminum universal, _NEW_ FR4, _NEW_ polycarbonate), two PCBs (original millmaxed w/slightly sketchy mini-USB connector, _NEW_ SnowPro with _very_ bright RGB underglow), _full_ frosted acrylic LED diffuser mid-layer, and a black chassis with a massive _engraved_ brushed brass bottom weight. Mini-USB connector on all PCBs. **Asking for $650 shipped**

2.	**Percent Studio Canoe Gen2 Svart, 2 builds** | This is probably the brightest per-key RGB board I’ve ever seen. There are two builds: (a) Everglide Sakuras (JTK linears) lubed on a brushed silver aluminum plate with lubed C3 stabilizers, and (b) Zealios V1 62g lubed on a purple anodized brushed aluminum plate with lubed Durock stabilizers. Colorway is black top/bottom with silver badge and LED accents, as well as an e-orange accent mid-layer. Half-gasket mount (bottom only), USB-C QMK/VIA compatible. _Keycaps not included._ **Asking for $625 shipped**

3.	~~GMK Olivia++ Light Base (sealed) | Not much to say about this one! **Asking for $315 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

4.	**GMK Calm Depths used** | Slight shine on home row (see photo), otherwise in very good condition. All keys are present including international (not pictured). Ships in tray. **Asking for $275 shipped**

All prices are OBO. Please comment before PM. _Please, do not use Reddit chat._

_I will also pay cash for most of these._

~~Spring~~ Winter cleaning is upon us! Have a few great boards for you in this post:

1.  **Cannonkeys Satisfaction75 Navy** | You have probably heard of the Satisfaction75. This one is round 1, number 144 of 250. Navy blue anodized with white enamel color-filled Cannonkeys logo. This is _not_ a perfect specimen, please check the imgur album above for more details. Everything that needs to function, does function: cleanly desoldered PCB, OLED, encoder with gold standard knob. Comes with factory bead-blasted brass plate, aftermarket POM plate with universal compatibility (split L-shift and split spacebar), CK soft case, and authenticity card. Does not include keycaps, keyswitches, or a battery for the real-time clock. Ideal board for a daily driver! **REPOSTED**

2. **TX75v2 Dark Grey built w/OG Milky Top Tangerines (V1.5?)** | [Sound Check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m1J8joqJvc) | Heavy-duty workhorse 75% board. Sandwich mount, brushed brass plate, but with the sound of these 3204-lubed OG tangies, you'd never know. Screw-in PCB-mount lubed GMK stabs, RGB sideglow, and a huge brass bottom weight. Case foam for some dampening. Heavy as heck at 3.1kg (same as the TX87v2!). Excellent condition with flawless anodizing. USB-C connector. Comes with two spare switches. **REPOSTED**

3. **Percent Studio Volt-80 TKL** | Winkeyless TKL with an extra two keys on the F-row. Cerakoted in Glacier Black because I wasn't a fan of the original Mango, it's a deep matte fingerprint magnet, but what a beautiful fingerprint magnet it is! Rear accent plate has been left E-white. PCB has Kailh hotswap sockets and per-key RGB along with a Matrix-like RGB accent above the arrow cluster. USB-C and Bluetooth capable, though you'd need to buy a battery (these did not ship with batteries). Integral plate and top case, dampening mat between plate and PCB already installed. Comes with lubed stabs, no switches, no keycaps, in original box. **REPOSTED**

4. **WASD V2 104-key Full-size** | Originally a Cherry Brown board, now a lubed Cherry Red board with Gateron Yellow on the spacebar and a few Gateron Black on the F-row. This board makes a great beater, or a soldering/desoldering practice board: the PCB pads are almost impossible to overheat, and the PCB lifts away from the plate once all switch pins have been hit with a desoldering gun. Costar plate-mount stabs included. If you want cheap keycaps for this, I have some available to make a complete board. **REPOSTED**

I've stock piled way too much keyboard stuff and have decided its long past time to trim down. Some of this stuff was purchased new from retailers. Some was purchased via resell from r/mm and similar. All of the GMK is going because even though I love the look of all of these sets, PBT is the better plastic 😬. Local pickup also available in Mid City Los Angeles.

CONUS ONLY!

I am currently interested in the following RAMA Artisans and will prioritize trades for these over paypal. I am not looking for RAMA Artisans outside of this list. I'm also willing to purchase these keycaps if you're looking to sell. Just DM price.

**Fusion60 HHKB**

I have a Fusion60 in hhkb layout with extra carbon fiber half plate, and a brass plate as well. Comes with the stock pcb soldered with outemu silent clear sky(clear top and sky bottom) lubbed with 3203 and they have u4 stems. I bought them switches from Daily Clack and ended up being super expensive due to 20 euro shipping and then 40 euros on customs fees.

The stabilizers in the board are the durock clears.

The solder job could be better as there are 2 wire jumps . The switches are very good tactiles and the board is amazing, but I find the typing angle uncomfortable for me, and maybe the fact that I put SA keycap didn't help as well.

There are 2 wire jumps in total, which makes the pcb in a not so great overall condition. The price is adjusted a little bit as well. The board is compatible with most standard 60% pcb in tsangan layout, so it could be replaced by a dz60 without a problem or a hs60 hhkb, cannonkeys instant 60 for example. Any questions feel free to ask.

Right now it is build with a instant60 pcb and durock L7s. the pcb has a few rough sockets and the 'u' one needs a bit of testing when assembling the switch to ensure that the pins make contact with the socket. This is **not included** in the price.

**Drop CTRL**

I have a drop CTRL bought in January and it's been unused since March due to Covid, as I was using it on the office and it stayed there for a while completely unused.

It cost 212 .51 $(191,25€) shipped on drop page + \~70€ customs tax

and the orange acrylic cover was 33€ shipped + 22€ (customs tax)

The switches are holy pandas with the Yok housings in black and halo clear stems, that I lubbed with 3204, and I changed the stabilizers to cherry ones, clipped and lubbed.

The board is like new really, was really lightly used, and as such I'm selling it a little under what I paid, bundled with the acrylic cover.

Might sell barebones only but prefered to sell it as a compete build.

&#x200B;

**KBDFans KBD67MII**

Bought it on mechmarket 1 or 2 months ago, but didn't really like it.

It is the PC hotswap vesion, which is like new, only has a really small scratch on the backweight.

It comes with lubbed durock stabs. I have bought foam from mkultra as well, and have other pom plate.

All layers of the board are a glossy black acrylic except for the plate (matte black acrylic) and bottom (frosted clear acrylic). Switches are the milky top, black bottom variety and were lubed with Krytox 205g0. Stabilizers are Durock v1s and were lubed with Krytox 205g0 on the housings and dielectric grease on the wires.

Whole board was used sparingly, probably for a total of less than 10 hours. Didn't like the Alice-esque layout.

And some additional [Take me home](https://imgur.com/a/Nu9VOzl) photos and videos .

This is a personal Engraved E-White Bahm Evelyn (Korean Alice Clone) . It is built with Hirose Orange switches that are filmed with Orange TX films , all lubed with Krytox 205G0 . I sourced them myself from Japan and they feel incredible to type on . The stabilizers are band-aid modified and lubed & I used a combo of red and black to match the style and the appearance of a Hirose switch . The wire is gold plated to match the brass reinforcement plate . LED's are sky-blue ,Pcb is Adelais Undergrow RGB programable by VIA or QMK .

Evelyn comes with an original brass plate used for the prototype (there are scratches on it ) , aluminum plate comes with a unique color combination and an extra fr4 matte black plate and an extra Adelais Arc-En-Ciel Pcb.

Evelyn has heat treatment black lines on the polished brass weight but no noticeable scratches on it. There are scratches on the inside of the top and bottom housing where the screws go in , otherwise on the exterior there are no visible scratches.

This is a personal Engraved E-White Bahm Evelyn (Korean Alice Clone) . It is built with Hirose Orange switches that are filmed with Orange TX films , all lubed with Krytox 205G0 . I sourced them myself from Japan and they feel incredible to type on . The stabilizers are band-aid modified and lubed & I used a combo of red and black to match the style and the appearance of a Hirose switch . The wire is gold plated to match the brass reinforcement plate . LED's are sky-blue ,Pcb is Adelais Undergrow RGB programable by VIA or QMK .

Evelyn comes with an original brass plate used for the prototype (there are scratches on it ) , aluminum plate comes with a unique color combination and an extra fr4 matte black plate and an extra Adelais Arc-En-Ciel pcb.

Evelyn has heat treatment black lines on the polished brass weight but no noticeable scratches on it. There are scratches on the inside of the top and bottom housing where the screws go in , otherwise on the exterior there are no visible scratches.

This is the blog of the Evelyn maker Bahm , here you can find Evelyn and his other keyboards . He is quite popular in Korea : [Bahm's Naver Blog](https://m.blog.naver.com/PostList.nhn?blogId=hjg7808)

Hello! Hope you all are doing well.

Today I have a couple of items that I do not use for sale/trade.

Prices include PayPal fees, but not shipping.  EU preferred, but I can ship internationally.

Bare in mind that I paid 23% import tax on ePBT Kuro/Shiro together with costly DHL shipping to my country that is why the price is higher that during the GB.

UPD: Sorry, I decided to hold Kuro/Shiro for now, found a keyboard on which I can put them.

|**~~ePBT Kuro/Shiro R2 Alphas/JP Mods~~**|~~180 EUR~~ **ON HOLD**|Never mounted. Moved JP mods from bag into hard plastic tray.|
|~~GMK N9 Ortho Add-on kit~~|~~45 EUR~~ **SOLD**|Sealed, never used. **NOTE:** You can buy this kit on [keeb.io](https://keeb.io) for 50$ that is why this sale is mostly for EU people.|
|~~BadHabitCaps Pumpkin Tiki-Key~~|~~15 USD~~ **SOLD**|I won this artisan during the Halloween giveaway, so asking price is what I paid for shipping (shipping to you is not included).|

Beautiful as is.

Happy Holidays to my reddit peeps!

~~GMK DMG R2 w/ Spacebars~~ ($240), ~~GMK WOB Drop~~ ($120), ~~ePBT Retro Cyrillic~~ ($130)

Looking to sell a few of items today to help me finance a future Toyota 4runner SUV so I can do some road tripping. Also helping those out who have been unable to find XMAS presents in these troubling times.

The DMG R2 was received in a trade. Condition is still mint condition perfect. Did not like the look on my keeb so deciding to sell. Did mount some keys to Cherry Blue switches. Spacebars is still sealed. Did not notice any major warping in the Spacebars. WOB set was recently purchased from Drop. Only opened for inspection so never mounted. No signs of warping in the Spacebars and did not see any defects or discolourization in the keycaps. Includes white accent keys. ePBT Retro Cyrillic was purchased from the Originative GB earlier this year. Just not a fan of PBT keycaps. Please note that ePBT PBT sets aren't perfect so there will be warping in the Spacebars and some mods do not have perfect rectangle side edges. Does not cause any issues when in use.

This is NOT FCFS since I'll be looking for buyers with a rep or peeps I've dealt with in the past. Local is the Twin Cities/Suburbs and will discount accordingly. Not afraid to sell to new peeps either if ur pretty convincing. All prices are firm and will include USPS shipping. Discounts if you don't need the retail packaging and okay with shipping in ziplock baggies. Keeping transactions to CONUS for now. Please send PM and reply to post. NO CHATS....NO TRADES....AND PLEASE NO LOW BALL OFFERS

I can take more pictures if needed and can answer any questions. I will try to answer all PMs but my dearest apologies if you don't get a response. Will update post when items are sold.

E-White Hirose Evelyn = [@-@](https://imgur.com/a/ufBU36S)

And some additional [Take me home](https://imgur.com/a/Nu9VOzl) photos and videos .

This is a personal Engraved E-White Bahm Evelyn (Korean Alice Clone) . It is built with Hirose Orange switches that are filmed with Orange TX films , all lubed with Krytox 205G0 . I sourced them myself from Japan and they feel incredible to type on . The stabilizers are band-aid modified and lubed & I used a combo of red and black to match the style and the appearance of a Hirose switch . The wire is gold plated to match the brass reinforcement plate . LED's are sky-blue ,Pcb is Adelais Undergrow RGB programable by VIA or QMK .

Evelyn comes with an original brass plate used for the prototype (there are scratches on it ) , aluminum plate comes with a unique color combination and an extra fr4 matte black plate and an extra Adelais Arc-En-Ciel Pcb.

Evelyn has heat treatment black lines on the polished brass weight but no noticeable scratches on it. There are scratches on the inside of the top and bottom housing where the screws go in , otherwise on the exterior there are no visible scratches.

E-White Hirose Evelyn = [@-@](https://imgur.com/a/ufBU36S)

And some additional [Take me home](https://imgur.com/a/Nu9VOzl) photos and videos .

This is a personal Engraved E-White Bahm Evelyn (Korean Alice Clone) . It is built with Hirose Orange switches that are filmed with Orange TX films , all lubed with Krytox 205G0 . I sourced them myself from Japan and they feel incredible to type on . The stabilizers are band-aid modified and lubed & I used a combo of red and black to match the style and the appearance of a Hirose switch . The wire is gold plated to match the brass reinforcement plate . LED's are sky-blue ,Pcb is Adelais Undergrow RGB programable by VIA or QMK .

Evelyn comes with an original brass plate used for the prototype (there are scratches on it ) , aluminum plate comes with a unique color combination and an extra fr4 matte black plate and an extra Adelais Arc-En-Ciel Pcb.

Evelyn has heat treatment black lines on the polished brass weight but no noticeable scratches on it. There are scratches on the inside of the top and bottom housing where the screws go in , otherwise on the exterior there are no visible scratches.

Hi all, 

Looking to sell my set of r1 laser gaijin alphas. Since I also have SA laser I've satisfied my weeb needs with that kit.

Set has been in storage for the last 6 mos but before that used for a few months on and off. Note, there IS shine on part of the spacebar but the alphas look mostly new. Please reference the album below for more pics.

Shipping will be without the tray, so shipped in a bag, in a box.

Happy Holidays to my reddit peeps!

~~GMK DMG R2 w/ Spacebars~~ ($240), ~~GMK WOB Drop~~ ($120), ~~ePBT Retro Cyrillic~~ ($130)

Looking to sell a few of items today to help me finance a future Toyota 4runner SUV so I can do some road tripping. Also helping those out who have been unable to find XMAS presents in these troubling times.

The DMG R2 was received in a trade. Condition is still mint condition perfect. Did not like the look on my keeb so deciding to sell. Did mount some keys to Cherry Blue switches. Spacebars is still sealed. Did not notice any major warping in the Spacebars. WOB set was recently purchased from Drop. Only opened for inspection so never mounted. No signs of warping in the Spacebars and did not see any defects or discolourization in the keycaps. Includes white accent keys. ePBT Retro Cyrillic was purchased from the Originative GB earlier this year. Just not a fan of PBT keycaps. Please note that ePBT PBT sets aren't perfect so there will be warping in the Spacebars and some mods do not have perfect rectangle side edges. Does not cause any issues when in use.

This is NOT FCFS since I'll be looking for buyers with a rep or peeps I've dealt with in the past. Local is the Twin Cities/Suburbs and will discount accordingly. Not afraid to sell to new peeps either if ur pretty convincing. All prices are firm and will include USPS shipping. Discounts if you don't need the retail packaging and okay with shipping in ziplock baggies. Keeping transactions to CONUS for now. Please send PM and reply to post. NO CHATS....NO TRADES....AND PLEASE NO LOW BALL OFFERS

I can take more pictures if needed and can answer any questions. I will try to answer all PMs but my dearest apologies if you don't get a response. Will update post when items are sold. Thank you everyone and be safe out there.",bought gmk dmg r2 + spacebars from u/plac3b0guy,"[US-MN] [H] GMK DMG R2, GMK WOB, ePBT Retro Cyrillic [W] Paypal, Local"

Hey there,

I am currently selling GMK Dots for 290€ + shipping. I bought it on [r/mm](https://www.reddit.com/r/mm/) myself and am looking to make my money back. The caps have no shine as can be seen in the timestamp.

I am also looking to buy the GMK Olivia Spacebars kit and the Keycravings Uruk WoB Artisan. You can hit me up with a trade or selling offer.

Would prefer buyers from the EU because of the lower likelihood of hiccups while shipping and less PayPal fees. If shipping is covered and you are willing to take the risk of international shipping, I will consider shipping internationally.

Also, only purchase the set if you want it immediately. GMK Dots R2 is supposed to go into Groupbuy-Phase early next year.

Hey there,

I am currently selling GMK Dots for 285€ + shipping.
I bought it on r/mm myself and am looking to make my money back. 285€ - PayPal fees is a bit less than what I‘ve paid for it. The caps have no shine as can be seen in the timestamp. 


I am also looking to buy GMK Olivia Light Base Set, the Spacebars kit and the GMK Ursa Tessie Rama Novelty. You can hit me up with a trade or a selling offer.

Would prefer buyers from the EU because of the lower likelihood of hiccups while shipping. If shipping is covered and you are willing to take the risk of international shipping, I will consider shipping internationally. Please also consider that because of additional PayPal fees for purchases from non-EU countries, the price of the set will increase according to the increase in PayPal fees.

Hello friends,  


Looking to trade my Kei SE (with the stainless steel bottom). I built it and like it but find myself using my ogre much more. It was a B-stock extra, but the external is essentially flawless. There are some machining marks on the inside case - but you can't see any of it when the case is screwed in.   


Currently built with Milky top Inks, lubed with 205g0, spring swapped to 65g long tx springs on a full alu plate.

I built it on stream a few days ago - here's the vod [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/822622314](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/822622314)

Looking for a few trades in the 65%/alice layout region - can add paypal if need be:  
\- Iron165 (Plum preferred but will take any color)  
\- Rukia  
\- any other interesting 65%/alice layouts  
\- Basically no hope here but gonna try anyways: TGR910CE (any colorway) will add paypal or even another board.

Happy Monday mechmarket, I'm back again trying to sell my Mode Eighty, with some keycap sets also for sale

CONUS buyers only, please

Not looking to trade at the moment, need more liquidity at the moment

Local buyers (Orange County) strongly preferred, especially for the keyboard

**Mode Eighty First Edition - Light**

The First Edition is sold out, but pre-orders are still up and personally I would suggest going that route if you don't need the extra bling of the First Edition and are willing to wait (estimated delivery in January, so not even that long). Plus, the pre-order is much cheaper at $470 and has a lot of really nice colour options. But if you still want the First Edition, I have a brand new Light one that I'm selling for below the $701.51 that I paid in total (CA taxes hit pretty hard). Comes with everything, keyboard still in the paper wrapper.

~~Asking $669.69 + shipping~~ SOLD

&#x200B;

**GMK Camping R2 Base**

New, sealed

Asking

~~$275 + shipping~~ SOLD

&#x200B;

**GMK Peach Blossom Base**

New, sealed

~~Asking $234.56 + shipping, or $222.22 + shipping, whichever you prefer (just wanted to do fun numbers)~~ SOLD

&#x200B;

$10 discount if you buy both GMK sets.

&#x200B;

**Infinikey Cafe Base**

New, sealed

I must admit the packaging is much nicer than the GMK sets, good job to Infinikey on that

~~Asking $169.420 + $10 shipping (yeah, I know I could've said $179.42 shipped)~~ SOLD

Hi mechmarket, I have a couple things I would like to sell today, not looking to trade this time because my keyboard expenditure has gotten out of control.

CONUS buyers only, please

Please note that there is a second sale of the Mode Eighty First Edition on 11/17, where 300 units will be offered (hotswap option available then). Also, there are currently B-stock units available at [Mode Design's website](https://shop.modedesigns.com/collections/first-edition-release/products/eighty-case-only?variant=32741173395538).

Anyhow, I'm selling the Mode Eighty because it was an impulse buy (did it in the bathroom at work) and it's simply too expensive for me to use personally (and I don't have a soldering iron). As such, I'm looking to sell it basically at cost to me (paid quite a lot over retail due to taxes mainly). I have not taken the keyboard out of the wrapping paper in fear of smudging its incredibly beautiful backside.

Local buyers strongly preferred, especially for the Mode Eighty, so if you happen to be located in/near Orange County and are willing to travel to somewhere close to me, that would be great and I can provide a little discount.

[Old timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/GOZJxFS) (more pictures of the Mode Eighty, please ignore the other items)

Hi mechmarket, I'm posting once again trying to sell/trade my Mode Eighty (strongly prefer selling)

Please note that the Mode Eighty First Edition is still available, for $640 (solderable, $650 for hot-swap), at Mode Design's website. Also, the pre-order is open, with many really nice colour options and a very appealing price of $470 as well as quite a speedy estimated delivery time in January next year.

With that aside, I'm mainly looking to sell the Mode Eighty that I have (cash is king, as I've learned from my trading days). It's brand new, and the keyboard remains sealed in the paper wrapper (never taken out because I was too scared that I would smudge the chrome bottom).

Despite the retail price of $640, I paid a total of $701.51. This is broken down into $15.11 in shipping (pretty good rate I must say), and $46.40 in taxes. If you're in Califorrnia, you will likely be paying the same price as I did.

~~My asking price will be $675 + shipping~~ SOLD

Local buyers (in/near Orange County) are strongly preferred due to shipping.

**Priority goes to selling, except if I get a superb deal on a trade.**

For trades:

Please note that I'm mainly looking to sell.

For keyboards, I'm only trading down, so that would mean +money on your end (I'm trying to decrease my keyboard expenditures account). I'm aware that the boards I'm interested in sell for quite a lot on the secondary market, but I listed them in case someone is willing to trade.

Trade value (arbitrarily determined by me) of the Mode Eighty will be around $650 to $700.

A list of things I'm interested in (not only keebs):

* Key65 alu
* Canoe Gen2
* Space65 CV
* Constellation by aeboards
* Chimera65
* Vega (at retail or close to retail, since there is still the GB)
* Sinn 556i, preferrably on bracelet and/or the blue dial version
* Oris Divers 65, 40mm, preferrably on bracelet
* Grand Seiko (models like the SBGX061 are around my budget)
* New 3070 (at retail or close to retail)
* New SFF 20 series cards (lower than retail)
* 2 bed, 2 bath single-family home in OC (jk jk)

For trades, I would also prefer local.

As always, feel free to PM me if you have any questions and/or concerns, I understand that the trades I have listed may be confusing.

Thank you and have a lovely day :)",sold gmk camping r2 base to /u/the_lavaflow,"[US-CA][H] Mode Eighty First Edition - Light [W] PayPal, Venmo, Trades"

Hi mechmarket, I'm back again to sell my Mode Eighty, along with a used ePBT WoB set

As usual, CONUS buyers only, please

Local buyers (Orange County) strongly preferred, especially for the keyboard.

**Mode Eighty First Edition - Light**

For transparency, I paid a total of $701.51 for this keyboard.

These are still in stock at Mode Design's [website](https://shop.modedesigns.com/collections/first-edition-release/products/eighty-case-only?variant=32741173395538), along with the pre-orders (good price, really nice colour options available, and delivery in January).

The keyboard has not been taken out of the paper wrapper (I was scared that I would smudge the bottom), and all the accessories are still in their original packaging, only thing I've done is take pictures.

Asking $678 + shipping

**ePBT WoB**

This set has been used for around 1.5 months on my NK65. No shine as far as I can tell, and the only keys I have used are the 65% ones (I have included a picture of my NK65 in the timestamp so you can see which keys I have used).

~~Asking $59 + shipping~~ SOLD

Hey all, i have a couple keycap sets up for sale today. My aussie decided it was a good idea to eat  several magnets off of the fridge. She is fine now, but the trip to the vet, a lot of barium, and several xrays later, im stuck with the massive bill. [Some cute pics of the magnet eater.](https://imgur.com/gallery/NTADDq9)

Volt80 - Snow White - ~~$600~~ ~~$550~~ Traded for Matrix Noah 

Original owner bought a battery and it works flawlessly over Bluetooth. I have it connected to my personal and work computer and toggle back and forth all day. When plugged in to use via USBc, the function row intermittently stops working for a few keys. I’m not sure what causes it, but I’ve been using it over Bluetooth without any problems. I’m assuming positive intent that the original owner only used it over Bluetooth, as this wasn’t disclosed to me. I have the original box and packing. No switches or keycaps included.

# Discounts and priorities will be given to bundles. All prices include PayPal fee and shipping* to most parts of EU and NA via DHL or UPS.

\*Remote charge might occur depending on your address so please pm it to me to check. Feel free to msg me about shipping in Asia because there might be a $5 discount from the courier. Pm if you are in Toronto, Canada for other cheaper arrangements.

The typical timeframe is 1-2 weeks, including domestic shipping to the proxy, their processing time in HK (3 days usually), time that cargos waiting for pick-up at bay and the time on flight to the destinations. It is pretty reliable since COVID-19 albeit possible delays during the holiday season. [Here's some DHL tracking after they pick up the package.](https://imgur.com/a/czxgagT)

Sold sets will be striked-thru. If you insist on splitting the kits from the bundle, extra shipping cost will be added.

Prices include shipping. Prices are OBO within reason.

~~**60 Lubed UHMWPE Inks (Tribosys 3204) - $69 shipped CONUS**~~ sold for $49
-

~~Desoldered, clean for hotswapping. Lubed with Tribosys 3204. Nice and glassy-smooth UHMWPE feel. 60 is the perfect qty for a WKL/ HHKB 60 :-)~~ 

**Switch Couture Frosted Alice + Mill-maxed Wonderland PCB - $259 shipped CONUS**
-

Got the case the other day, and threw in my Wonderland PCB. Even though stacked acrylic is stunningly simple, its sound is very hard to beat - super consistent and clean. Case has been put together ... in shipping, I will remove my switches / keycaps / stabs, and plop in some spare switches to keep the PCB in place. 

PCB is made hotswap using the pricier, cleaner 7305 sockets. IMO, Mill-max sockets are better than Kailh sockets in every way in terms of hotswap capability (except installation, which I've already done). See pics for millmax layout. Note that with hotswap, the Switch Couture plate doesn't 'hold' on to the switches for stabilized keys - I have no issues using the board with hotswap though :-)

Bought this the other day - but couldn't figure out how to program it. Ended up desoldering it completely and stripping it down, only to find out that I had to press the 'RESET' button the PCB for it to show up in QMK...  -.- and no longer want to build it back, would rather use this to fund prototypes. No switches 
included.

Excellent condition. Came from KBDfans with a small nick near the screwhole (see album). Otherwise, everything is essentially brand new. PCB is fitted with the fancier 7305 Mill-max sockets, allowing for hotswap capabilities. The sockets alone were about $10, KBDfans shipping is $20, and the numpad is $89. The sockets are not soldered - they were fitted very tightly and did not need to be soldered, but if you would like then I can solder them in. Works perfectly. Caps are not included.

**KN2.10^2 - $369, [includes Keyforge Mulder V3* (Blood Seal)](https://i.imgur.com/hISpO7d.jpg)**
-

Good condition overall, small dot near USB port, small speck on front left corner, dots on brass weight, some glue internal. [See album for pics.](https://imgur.com/a/EBFnerm)

Comes with:

- KN2.10^2
- 1.5mm black half-plate
- 4mm THICC black full-plate
- desoldered PCB

**This board is compatible with DZ60 (solderable) from KBDfans, and I'm including two plates of different styles. You can get one of those PCBs for $30something from KBDfans to make two builds.**

[I'm also including this Keyforge Mulder, it has a slightly flattened nose as I received it like this from a friend.](https://i.imgur.com/hISpO7d.jpg)

WoB is optional - if you would like to add the WoB set, +$80. This is the original R1 WoB without the white enter/esc, and has a decent amount of shine.

**Mill-maxed Hotswappable Wonderland PCB - $109**
-

My trusty Wonderland PCB, mill-maxed with 7305 sockets. It's a black PCB, soldered with split-shift and full backspace. Millmax sockets are far superior to Kailh sockets IMO, being more durable w/ longer lifespan, allowing for more space for flex / room under the PCB, and being able to insert/remove switches without having to worry about breaking a socket.

Graystudio Think 6.5 (black polycarb, badgeless, hotswap, NK Blueberries)

As the title says, I have a badgeless, black polycarb, hotswap, Think 6.5 that I need to let go. I just don’t use it anymore. Includes stock, unlubed NK Blueberries and one Tealio for the Esc key rgb. Built with durock stabs lubed with Krytox. I will point out that one of the interior screws is slightly stripped that hold the pcb to the top case. No issues with functionality at all.

This is a badgeless version too, which is extremely rare in the black polycarb. It is in great condition and sounds phenomenal. I'm hoping someone else can get some good use out of it. I would say it’s been typed on for maybe a couple weeks. Any questions please ask.

Hello, I'm looking to sell the GMK darling extras from Black Friday, wanted to get the base + novelties but wasn't fast enough for it and not interested anymore in the set so I'm selling what I got. 

Everything is brand new, sealed as shown on the timestamp. Tried to fix the keys from going all over the trays but no luck but it’s sealed so nothing is affected.

GMK Darling Alphas - $110 + shipping - SOLD for asking!

GMK Darling Spacebars $62 + shipping - Sold locally to a friend

GMK Extensions - $53 + shipping (cheaper than novelkeys, I'm taking a loss on this) - Sold locally to a friend

From what I've seen so far in mech market for these items, my prices are pretty fair. 

Prefer selling in bundles so less shipping to do and local sale in NYC or shipping in CONUS but willing to ship international if no one is buying. Please comment before PMing me, thanks!",bought gmk darling alphas from u/rysteria,"[US-NY] [H] GMK Darling Alphas, Spacebars, Extensions [W] PayPal"

# Discounts and priorities will be given to bundles. All prices include PayPal fee and shipping* to most parts of EU and NA via DHL or UPS.

\*Remote charge might occur depending on your address so please pm it to me to check. Feel free to msg me about shipping in Asia because there might be a $5 discount from the courier. Pm if you are in Toronto, Canada for other cheaper arrangements.

The typical timeframe is 1-2 weeks, including domestic shipping to the proxy, their processing time in HK (3 days usually), time that cargos waiting for pick-up at bay and the time on flight to the destinations. It is pretty reliable since COVID-19 albeit possible delays during the holiday season. [Here's some DHL tracking after they pick up the package.](https://imgur.com/a/czxgagT)

Sold sets will be striked-thru. If you insist on splitting the kits from the bundle, extra shipping cost will be added.

Super sorry to see this one go, I have too many boards right now and more to come next year.

The condition is like new and the board sounds and looks great. It comes built with 205g0 lubed and filmed 65g mauves on a PC plate and the Savage65 pcb, along with an extra FR4 plate if you want to rebuild or build with another PCB like the Instant60. Also comes with the CK carrying case as shown in the picture.

This board does NOT come with the keycaps shown.

Item descriptions and prices below!

Item | Description | Price/Avail
---|---|----
~~Key65 Gasket Mount Polycarbonate Hotswap + White Kanji Weight~~| ~~Board is in great condition, no noticeable scuffs as far as I can tell. Board is optioned out at WKL, no badge, and White Kanji weight on the back. Comes with hotswap pcb, aluminum plate, plate foam/rubber, lubed durock v1 stabs. It's quite a pleasant board, but a new desktop build is on the horizon for me. Keycaps and switches not included. Can provide more pictures if requested.~~| ~~**$620 shipped OBO** in original packaging ~~OR **bundle w/ GMK Oblivion for $820 shipped OBO**~~~~
GMK Oblivion Regular Base Kit | Lovely keycap set, but it's time for it to go. Great condition on alphas/spacebars/all the keys. There is ONE flaw that I have found; the left shift key has a minor bit of shine and some sort of ding on the lower left portion. The ding is **not visible** when mounted in board. The shine is visible from certain angles. | **$240 shipped in bags** (was going to list for $250, but reduced price by $10 for the left shift ""issues"".
~~OLKB White Hotswap Planck Hi-Pro~~ | ~~Again, a lovely board but I just don't use it enough. I got [the (now sold out) case](https://olkb.com/products/planck-hi-pro-bottom?variant=31558699679778) from OLKB for $65 + $15 for the hi-pro aluminum plate. A planck rev6 pcb is about $55 on drop, so totals out to roughly $130. The best part of this build is the case, it's quite lovely. Includes keycaps + a nice GMK stab (not sure if pretool but it's really nice), no switches.~~ | ~~**$140 shipped** ($130 for keeb + $10 shipping roughly).~~ **SOLD For $130 Local**

I only ship **CONUS / Canada**, can do US proxies but you assume the risks. Can do local pickup 95377 if you would like a small discount. I can also bundle in switches into either purchase if you would like (not much selection, but if someone wants a keyboard + keycap + switch bundle, I'd be happy to dig into my collection). I love to bundle anyway haha.

[TIMESTAMP](https://imgur.com/a/HoKmlCu)

Today I'm selling my Space65. It's quite a gorgeous board but holidays are coming up and I think that some money in my pocket would be better than having a 4th 65% keyboard haha.

**Hotswap Space65 White/Gold/Black build as follows:** 

* Perfect condition, no flaws (rubber feet placed such that user can open case easily without ruining adhesive).

* E-White top/bottom case

* Black L shaped weight installed

* Black mid-piece installed

* Black LED badge installed (magnet hotswap)

* MILLMAX 0305 pcb installed

* Carbon Fiber Plate installed

* Lubed Durock V1 stabs installed

* Switches will be removed before sale (unless board is bundled with NK Creams)

**Accessories/Extras as follows:**

* Desoldered pcb (can provide more pictures upon request)

* Extra Gold mid-piece

* Extra Gold LED badge (magnet hotswap)

* Plate / Case Foam (not installed, but can be installed since it's hotswap)

* All original screws, adhesives, screwdriver, tweezers, LEDs, badge stuffs, etc.

~~Given other sale prices for Space65 CV and the extras that are included (especially hotswap pcb), I think **$700 shipped CONUS** is more than a fair price. If you feel otherwise, shoot me an offer and we can talk it out. Will **bundle with lubed/filmed creams for $750 shipped**. Both PCBs will be tested prior to shipment and proof will be provided to buyer. Keycaps not included in sale. Prefer not to split Space65 CV parts/extras, but will do so if there are buyers for each part!~~ **SOLD for asking!**

~~Creams Lubed with 205g0 / filmed with resized thicc films can be purchased alone for **$70 shipped**. Can include up to ~20x extra unlubed creams if you want, for retail cost or a little under retail. WILL ALSO TRADE CREAMS FOR A NICE COILED CABLE, PREFER YC8/LEMO STYLE PUSH-PULL CONNECTORS, BUT OPEN TO OFFERS :)~~ **SOLD for $65 + shipping to Canada :)**

Item | Price | Description
---|---|----
Magicforce 68 | $45 shipped | Gateron Greens, white LEDs. Stock. Used a few times but no signs of any wear.
IDOBO 75 | $88 shipped | Barebones, black alu plate and low-pro case. Has odd [blemishes](https://imgur.com/a/nwf5ew3) on left and right (mostly left) that are hard to capture. Doesn't seem to be damage but perhaps an error during anodization process. Not super easy to see under normal light but they are there. Includes a cut sheet of copy paper to reflect RGB underglow upward.
~~Lily58 Pro~~ | ~~$128 shipped~~ | ~~Uses an Elite-C v3.1 on each side. Elite-Cs and OLEDs are socketed for easier replacement. Flashed with VIA. Includes x58 Gateron Yellows lubed with 3204. Does not include TRRS cable, but I can throw in a white w/ clear wrap cable for $4.~~ *Sold for $118 without switches*
~~GMK Oblivion V2~~ | ~~$500 shipped~~ | ~~Includes Git Base, Space Keys, Oblivion Cadet, Hagoromo Alphas, Alternate Function Colors, and all keys from the fix kit. Some were mounted briefly on an 1800 board but otherwise unused. Space Keys and Hagoromo Alphas kits are sealed. All kits will come in their original packaging/tray and with banderole.~~ *Git Base and Hago Alphas sold for $400; Sapce, Cadet, and Alt Function sold for $135*
GMK Camping R2 | $500 shipped | Includes Base, Latin Alphas, Novelties, and Spacebars. All kits sealed. All kits will come in their original packaging/tray and with banderole.
MT3 Godspeed | $350 shipped | Includes Solar Alphas, Apollo Micons, Micons Accents, Lunar Milky Way, Split Spacebars, and 6.25u Spacebars. All kits come condensed into trays as pictured (some kits came with keys individually bagged; nightmare to organize). Briefly mounted to try out the profile but I wasn't a fan of the R4 bottom row.

Been in the keeb game for a few years now. I have a good idea now of what I'm looking for in a board, so it's time to start selling the things I'm not using.

&#x200B;

**IDOBO 75 - $90**

Ortholinear 75-key layout in 60% form factor. Barebones. USB-C connector. RGB underglow. Black aluminum case and plate. Runs QMK firmware.

Had to solder a few of the hotswap sockets since they weren't soldered to the pads when I received it. Everything is secure now. I couldn't get used to ortho layouts, so I ended up using the case temporarily for a 60% gaming board. I put a piece of copy paper in the bottom of the case to reflect the RGB lighting up through the PCB holes.

&#x200B;

**Magicforce 68 - $48**

White and silver case. White LEDs. Gateron Green switches. USB Mini-B connector, cable included. Completely stock.

# Discounts and priorities will be given to bundles. All prices include PayPal fee and shipping* to most parts of EU and NA via DHL or UPS.

\*Remote charge might occur depending on your address so please pm it to me to check. Feel free to msg me about shipping in Asia because there might be a $5 discount from the courier. Pm if you are in Toronto, Canada for other cheaper arrangements.

The typical timeframe is 1-2 weeks, including domestic shipping to the proxy, their processing time in HK (3 days usually), time that cargos waiting for pick-up at bay and the time on flight to the destinations. It is pretty reliable since COVID-19 albeit possible delays during the holiday season. [Here's some DHL tracking after they pick up the package.](https://imgur.com/a/czxgagT)

Sold sets will be striked-thru. If you insist on splitting the kits from the bundle, extra shipping cost will be added.

Up for sale my Miya 68 Pro Panda edition re-fitted with Zilent V2 67g switches (lubed with Krytox 205 / 105 on springs). It has white LED backlight. Condition is used although switches are just recently changed and have very little use.

The reason I sell this one is that... I really like it! Therefore I went for two more custom made in my favourite [colours](https://imgur.com/gallery/ENJpZQe). Now this one is loneliest in the family and looking for new home because it turns out that I am not really a collector.

Original USB cable is included although not pictured.

Switches are just lying around. I'm not building any more MX boards so I don't need them.

GMK caps were bought for a potential board but I never got another MX board. Pricing will be cheaper if ***shipped without a tray*** but the buyer takes responsibility. This is cheaper than the other ones I see listed but feel free to offer whatever you think is fair.

# Discounts and priorities will be given to bundles. All prices include PayPal fee and shipping* to most parts of EU and NA via DHL or UPS.

\*Remote charge might occur depending on your address so please pm it to me to check. Feel free to msg me about shipping in Asia because there might be a $5 discount from the courier. Pm if you are in Toronto, Canada for other cheaper arrangements.

The typical timeframe is 1-2 weeks, including domestic shipping to the proxy, their processing time in HK (3 days usually), time that cargos waiting for pick-up at bay and the time on flight to the destinations. It is pretty reliable since COVID-19 albeit possible delays during the holiday season. [Here's some DHL tracking after they pick up the package.](https://imgur.com/a/czxgagT)

Sold sets will be striked-thru. If you insist on splitting the kits from the bundle, extra shipping cost will be added.

Hello everyone！This is TT from OwLab.Today we are introducing a new keyboard designed by my designer friend Nomi and me.The origin of this keyboard is to commemorate the music band -OWL which I set up and music I loved.We started to have this design idea in May 2020. After four months of development and modification, we set up a group buy in China in September 2020.With good feedbacks, we have ordered extras and decided to bring it to all friends in the customized mechanical keyboard communities around the world!

Super sorry to see this one go, I have too many boards right now and more to come next year.

The condition is like new and the board sounds and looks great. It comes built with 205g0 lubed and filmed 65g mauves on a PC plate and the Savage65 pcb, along with an extra FR4 plate if you want to rebuild or build with another PCB like the Instant60. Also comes with the CK carrying case as shown in the picture.

This board does NOT come with the keycaps shown.

Hi mechmarket, I'm parting with two olive-green-coloured keysets that have been sitting around sad and neglected:

|~~GMK Olive (Base kit, 40s kit, spacebars kit). Very lightly used, no shine.~~|~~$375 shipped wherever (in bags!)~~ SOLD|
|:-|:-|
|Katakana Cherry PBT, Matcha. Barely used.|$110 shipped wherever|

The GMK set will be sent in bags rather than in the tray depicted. Since the GMK trays changed, I don't have any boxes on hand that are appropriate for a tray of this size. If you feel strongly about having the tray, I can try and look for a larger box, but it'll cost more and take longer to ship out.

Prices are in USD, and include shipping and Paypal fees. I prefer Canadian buyers for shipping simplicity (and not paying Paypal currency conversion fees), but I'm open to buyers from anywhere. If shipping to your location turns out to be way pricier than shipping to Canada/CONUS, we can negotiate.

These are not FCFS -- I'm going to sleep and I'll handle messages in the morning. Leave a comment below and then send me a private message. **Do not use Reddit chat!** I will not reply to Reddit chats.

Since my last post garnered a lot of attention, I just want to thank everyone who commented and thank the community as a whole. When I joined the scene and wandered into various discord servers, I’ve made awesome new friends who’ve helped me in various ways including career advice. So thank you all. 

Again, just trying to go for a Jane V2 CE with the multicolor weight or possibly a TGR Alice. I know that my listed PayPal amount won’t cover both unless someone is in the Christmas giving mood lol. But I’d be grateful for either.

###Epilogue

After searching far and wide, like Ash Ketchum, I was able to secure my grail board - Jane V2 CE; After acquiring the grail, I thought that it would be best to trim down my current collection. Due to me being busy with work, I haven’t had the time to build the boards that I am listing here today, but they are amazing boards and deserve an owner who would use it daily.

Item | Price | Description
---|---|----
Magicforce 68 | $45 shipped | Gateron Greens, white LEDs. Stock. Used a few times but no signs of any wear.
IDOBO 75 | $88 shipped | Barebones, black alu plate and low-pro case. Has odd [blemishes](https://imgur.com/a/nwf5ew3) on left and right (mostly left) that are hard to capture. Doesn't seem to be damage but perhaps an error during anodization process. Not super easy to see under normal light but they are there. Includes a cut sheet of copy paper to reflect RGB underglow upward.
~~Lily58 Pro~~ | ~~$128 shipped~~ | ~~Uses an Elite-C v3.1 on each side. Elite-Cs and OLEDs are socketed for easier replacement. Flashed with VIA. Includes x58 Gateron Yellows lubed with 3204. Does not include TRRS cable, but I can throw in a white w/ clear wrap cable for $4.~~ *Sold for $118 without switches*
~~GMK Oblivion V2~~ | ~~$500 shipped~~ | ~~Includes Git Base, Space Keys, Oblivion Cadet, Hagoromo Alphas, Alternate Function Colors, and all keys from the fix kit.

MT3 Godspeed | $350 shipped | Includes Solar Alphas, Apollo Micons, Micons Accents, Lunar Milky Way, Split Spacebars, and 6.25u Spacebars. All kits come condensed into trays as pictured (some kits came with keys individually bagged; nightmare to organize). Briefly mounted to try out the profile but I wasn't a fan of the R4 bottom row.

Been in the keeb game for a few years now. I have a good idea now of what I'm looking for in a board, so it's time to start selling the things I'm not using.

&#x200B;

**IDOBO 75 - $90**

Ortholinear 75-key layout in 60% form factor. Barebones. USB-C connector. RGB underglow. Black aluminum case and plate. Runs QMK firmware.

Had to solder a few of the hotswap sockets since they weren't soldered to the pads when I received it. Everything is secure now. I couldn't get used to ortho layouts, so I ended up using the case temporarily for a 60% gaming board. I put a piece of copy paper in the bottom of the case to reflect the RGB lighting up through the PCB holes.

&#x200B;

**Magicforce 68 - $48**

White and silver case. White LEDs. Gateron Green switches. USB Mini-B connector, cable included. Completely stock.

**~~1.  Gray KBD67 V2 MKII hotswap w/ DIY polished weight~~**        **~~$300~~** **~~$290  shipped~~** **Sold**

Not my daily drive. After I saw some polishing post, I just try to polish the weight by myself, since I'm not an expert in polishing by any means. So you can see the result from the picture, is it imperfect at some angle. Other than the weight, there is only one imperfection on the bottom case as shown in the picture. I also bought a white FR4 plate, I really enjoy the FR4 Plate than the original brass plate.

It will includes the Gray KBG67 MKII case and weight, brass plate, white FR4 plate, original hot swap PCB. (switches are no included.)

**~~2. Susuwatari base+Extras~~**      **~~$160~~** **~~$150 shipped~~**   **Sold**

Mounted once, not on my daily drive, total typing time might less than one hour.

**~~3. heavy industry    $100 shipped~~**  **Sold**

I get it from discord, no shine, only the 6.25U spacebar is imperfect as picture shown.

**~~4. Infinikey Cafe Base+add on    $200 shipped~~** **Sold**

Mounted once, feels it doesn't match my keyboard color.

Seem the the add-on is much more popular than the base. If you just need the base, you can also PM me.

Hi guys!

I have the following sets for sale, prices do not include shipping.

I am looking to donate some cash from this sale to a local cat rescuer, can view her instagram at [.@fioloh](https://www.instagram.com/fioloh/?hl=en). She has been helping many stray cats/dogs (mainly cats) find homes, seek medical help (including surgeries) as well as helping to foster. I found her work really meaningful (especially because I like cats). Hence, I'll state 2 prices (just $10 difference), if you would like to help, you can opt to purchase the slightly more expensive price, it's perfectly okay if you don't want to. The donation will be publicly recorded at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asY5BAWSZ_pmxUy2jxmaSa1eHDddTiLQlEhGi1niuyw/edit#gid=1722981492), under tehbingg. I'll update here once donated. (I hope this is allowed by the mods, otherwise please let me know, I'll be willing to remove.)

This would not be FCFS as I would like to prioritize the donation prices to help a little more.

That being said, here are the kits:

**Razer Huntsman TE -60 Shipped OBO**

Bought this used and there is some gloss on the WASD keys. Has Razer's red switches. Condition is really good otherwise

This is the 2019 version of the keyboard, so no updated stabs or Type C. Bought this barebones. Has lubed Gateron Silent Reds and the stock stabs are also lubed.

I can toss in some keycaps if you want but theyre pretty faded

\*\*\*Winner has been chosen, Pending confirmation, u/ma77777

\*\*\*\* second edit, responded and is now confirmed the winner, thanks everyone for the kind feedback, it's nice to see that everyone has something to say!

Hey there guys, by now I'm probably known as the krytox lube post spammer lol but I do like to engage with everyone in the community, so I feel this is a cool opportunity to be able to contribute to a wonderful hobby. Before falling into the mechanical keyboard rabbit hole I never mailed a package to anyone, or even less waited weeks/months to receive something I paid for already. This board was my first trade and for some sentimental reason I feel someone new deserves this more than me selling it.

With that said, I'd like to give someone the luxury of having the opportunity to have a complete board free of charge as their introduction to this awesome hobby we all like to experience.  It is a silver tokyo60 v1 with a hotswap PCB. It has lubed/spring swapped 63.5g unholy pandas. The keycaps were also the first set I bought, a monte carlo/copper theme PBT. The rest of the keycaps will be included and shipped with the package.

**How to enter:**

Simply comment what was the best thing that happened to you this year. Thank you very much guys, I will leave this up for 24 hours and choose someone at random with a generator. I hope you all enjoyed the holidays and spent time with everyone you consider important. I wish you all good luck!",sold gmk analog dreams num kit to u/dinkusdankus,[Giveaway] Fully built Tokyo60 for someone new in the community

Hopefully I'm not posting too often but figured since my queue is open and I changed my branding (previously ykzboards; now baoboards!) I'd make another post :) I am currently located in **Plano TX 75025**, if you're in the area I don't mind doing pick-ups / drop-offs!

&#x200B;

**[Build Album](https://imgur.com/a/DS5BhWX)**

**[Example Soldering Work](https://imgur.com/a/lsqZoMz)**

&#x200B;

**PRICING**

Just as the title says, build services are **FREE**! I wanna keep it this way for the foreseeable future as well because I enjoy building keyboards, so much that I'm often cycling boards through the market just for new experiences!

&#x200B;

**GET STARTED**

1. Fill out this **[build services form!](https://forms.gle/7MAyvbgaPBGEZNof6)**

2. I'll follow up on any missing details and will give you my shipping address once everything is confirmed

3. Send out the board(s) needed to be serviced

4. Once ready, I'll build the board live on Twitch under my new name!

5. After the build, I'll invoice you for shipping (if applicable) and send it back out ASAP for you to enjoy!

&#x200B;

**CONTACT ME**

Feel free to message me on the following platforms:

- Discord: bao#1111

- Reddit: /u/dangostana

&#x200B;

**Provided Services**

- Soldering / assembly (open to mill-maxing!)

- Desoldering / disassembly (only for rebuilding)

- Clipping and lubing stabilizers (band-aid mods available upon request)

- Basic QMK / VIA configuration (can flash as needed)

&#x200B;

**Tools**

- SH72 soldering iron

- Hakko FR-301 desoldering gun

- ESD tweezers for PCB testing

- 63/37 leaded 0.031"" / 0.8mm Kester solder

&#x200B;

**Optional Switch Lubing**

Switch lubing can be done at $0.25 per switch ($0.20 if you provide your own lube). I am open to lubing separately from build requests but am more likely to accept if the lubing is done alongside a build request. I currently have Krytox 205g0, 105, Tribosys 3203, and 3204 available for use.

Since my last post garnered a lot of attention, I just want to thank everyone who commented and thank the community as a whole. When I joined the scene and wandered into various discord servers, I’ve made awesome new friends who’ve helped me in various ways including career advice. So thank you all. 

Again, just trying to go for a Jane V2 CE with the multicolor weight or possibly a TGR Alice. I know that my listed PayPal amount won’t cover both unless someone is in the Christmas giving mood lol. But I’d be grateful for either.

Thanks again. Have a great day!

###Epilogue

After searching far and wide, like Ash Ketchum, I was able to secure my grail board - Jane V2 CE; After acquiring the grail, I thought that it would be best to trim down my current collection. Due to me being busy with work, I haven’t had the time to build the boards that I am listing here today, but they are amazing boards and deserve an owner who would use it daily.

Hi everyone!

**KBD67v2**

I have a burger mounted hotswap e-white KBD67v2 from the last in stock sale. It's built with lubed and filmed alpacas, durock stabs, brass plate. It has case and plate foams installed. I've used it for about 2 months and have kept it very clean and have been very careful with it. It's in perfect condition. Was going to keep this for my collection, but now I need the money for school, so I've finally decided to sell it. Selling it with the switches, not parting. I'll also give you a few extra replacement switches. Looking for $450 shipped CONUS.

I'll throw in a set of new white keycaps(3rd image in timestamp) that I have laying around for free in case it's your first board and you don't have keycaps.

**~~GMK Delta + Spacebars~~**

~~I also have a set of SEALED BINB GMK Delta and spacebar kit. Not separating, sorry. Was going to use it for my new board, but again, need the money for school. Sadge. Looking for $400 shipped CONUS.~~ Sold for 390.
