Dug through my box of kb components and came across my harvested Topre domes. 

I believe these OG Sony BKE domes are somewhere within the range of 45g to 55g weight. Despite the color differences, the weight feels similar to me. 

Sorry I haven't used any of the BKE Redux domes to compare against the OG Sony domes.

For the consistency of all domes being sourced from a single donor board, I will only sell the OG Sony BKE domes in sets of either 60x domes or 66x domes.

Item | Description | Price
:--|:--|--:
OG Sony BKE dome set | uniform light grey domes (non-carbon padded stabilizers) | $150 for 60x (two stabs) or $165 for 66x (four stabs)
OG Sony BKE dome set | light grey domes &amp; grey carbon padded stabilizers | $150 for 60x (two stabs) or $165 for 66x (four stabs)
OG Sony BKE dome set | uniform brownish-grey domes (non-carbon padded stabilizers) | $150 for 60x (two stabs) or $165 for 66x (four stabs)
OG Sony BKE dome set | brownish-grey domes &amp; grey carbon padded stabilizers | $150 for 60x (two stabs) or $165 for 66x (four stabs)
72x Sony BKE9400 55g? dark grey domes | prefer to sell in quantities that fill an entire kb, e.g. 60x, 66x | $1 per dome
RF 87U variable dome set | 87x domes from RF 87U variable weight kb | $20 for 87x
Miya RGB 68 keyboard | Ducky x Varmilo, Enchanted Purple, silent MX red switches, minor scuffs on case, no original box | $120
Hyperfuse Origins set + Fugu | sealed GMK base set + matching Legacy Fugu | $285

  &amp;nbsp;

I've finally got my preferences dialed in and no longer need these extras. I want to sell them quickly and the prices are a little low to reflect that. CONUS only please! Please note that the prices do not reflect shipping costs, we'll estimate that if you decide to buy something. Not FCFS as I'll be offering big discounts for bulk buyers.   
  
&amp;nbsp;

The Rama and Tofu are in ""good"" condition and the EO-87 is essentially pristine. The EO-87 and M65-A are soldered and the tofu is hotswap, I won't be de-soldering anything so this is an ""as-is"" sort of thing. All keycap sets have been used a fair amount so a little bit of shine can be expected on all except perhaps the Delta and Infinikey sets.   
  
  &amp;nbsp;
  
Comment here and then send a PM please, all chats will be ignored. Thanks for reading!

Item | Description | Price | Available
-------|---|----|----
TX EO-87 WKL | Purchased on a whim so I could take photos and try winkeyless. It's in perfect condition and built with Alpacas (deskkey films, krytox 205g0/GPL 105 on springs).  | $400 + Shipping| YES
RAMA M65-A (Rose Gold)| In good working condition, a couple scuffs on the bottom weight but nothing visible while using. The RGB underglow works perfectly as well. It's built with Gat Ink V2s lubed with Krytox 205g0 (no films)| $450 + Shipping | YES
Tofu 65 | What is there to say about it, it's a hotswap Tofu in good condition with no issues whatsoever! Easy and simple.| $150 + Shipping | YES

GMK Delta Base| Good condition, small amounts of shine | $250 + shipping or cheaper if bundled with a keyboard | YES
GMK Bento + Bars + Salmon Rama | A small amount of shine, in good condition other than that.

Hi Guys,

Unloading somethings to make space for all these GBs. Apologies if some of these prices are too much. Trying to recover what I paid for but please feel free to PM me to work something out. Bundle items for a discount

**GMK 8008 Base kit sealed with 8008 deskpad - $345 Shipped for both OBO**

**GMK Olivia ++ Dark Base sealed - $ 275 Shipped OBO**

**Barelycorn Keyboard Kit - $110** **Shipped**

This was an impulse buy and its brand new. Note: it is still available on NovelKeys for $115 + Shipping and tax.

**Take the below keyboards for $105 Shipped** OBO?

**Razer Huntsman TE -60 Shipped OBO**

Bought this used and there is some gloss on the WASD keys. Has Razer's red switches. Condition is really good otherwise

**GMMK Compact - $62 Shipped OBO**

This is the 2019 version of the keyboard, so no updated stabs or Type C. Bought this barebones. Has lubed Gateron Silent Reds and the stock stabs are also lubed. I have a custom coiled cable that has a Micro-USB end for this keyboard that will be included for free. Note: the space bar has a glorious panda switch but I can replace it with the gateron red. I can toss in some keycaps if you want but theyre pretty faded

**NOT FCFS, Local or bundles will be priority**

**SHIPPING CONUS ONLY** 

Hi Guys, Happy new year!! Im local to NYC and can deliver tonight only for free! (if youre not too far)

I have for sale couple of items:

**GK61 Aluminum Version (hotswappable) - $110 shipped** 

\- My first custom keyboard! Very friendly beginner keyboard because you get to test out many switches on an aluminum board. Comes with lubed and modded stabs.  The plate has some marks from using the switch remover. Combine this the the holy pandas for $5 off

**Drop Holy panda v2s with Super lube 51004 x67 - $75 shipped in bags**

\- Tactiles arent for me, but hope to find a good home for these! can include 3 stock holy pandas as well.

**GMK Dualshot - $315 shipped in trays** 

**-** Mounted once for pics. These looks so good in person. Sadly, need to fund other groupbuys 

**NovelKeys WoB** \- $70 shipped in original packaging

\- barely used, these feel super good with my mauves but im looking to get a Gmk BoW or WoB

&amp;#x200B;

**GMK Oblivion r2** \- Looking for trades but if you must buy take it for $305 shipped in bags. 

They have no shine (can take better pics of keycaps upon request). modifiers have around 1-2 weeks use and the rest have almost no use 

&amp;#x200B;

KAT MIlkshake Ortho - Looking to trade for modifiers or anything else. Dont really know how much these go for so if you must buy i guess I can let it go for $120. Dm me to discuss further about trades tho!

&amp;#x200B;

Will take off $6 for each item bundled! Prioritizing local &gt; highest confirmed trades &gt; else

Let me know if you have any questions!",sold gmk olivia light to /u/kuuroi,"[US-NY] [H] GK 61 Alu,GMK Dualshot,GMK Oblivion r2, lubed gateron yellows x61, super lubed Holy pandas x67, Novel Keys WoB, KAT Milkshake Ortho[W] Paypal, trades"

Cleaning out a bunch of stuff. Everything is boxed and will ship on 12/10.

I am not looking for trades. I am only selling these boards to make room for the group buys I am in right now. That means that I am not looking to deviate to drastically from my asking prices since this is not a need to sell situation.

***CONUS sales only please. Shipping is a flat $6 for everything except the Elephant and m0110 ( shipping for those boards is included in the price). Keyboard shipping is listed separately below. I will ship insured via USPS with tracking on 12/10***

***Message only, I will not respond to chat***

I will send PayPal invoices for all purchases and you will receive an email from Shippo with tracking information.

**This last point is important. If you do not have any trades on mechmarket, I will unfortunately not be parting with the Elephant, the m0110, or Jamon.**
