~~I have a hotswappable Redragon TKL K552 for sale. I've done some customizations to it to make it a little nicer IMO. They are:~~

&#x200B;

* ~~Switched out some of the MX Blues for Kailh Box Jades like on the space bar, backspace, enter, escape, shifts, tab, caps lock, etc. to give a nice click sound for those keys.~~
* ~~Bought a set of PBT key caps.~~
* ~~Replaced the stock white cable for a nice sleeved pink one.~~

~~I want this to be priced fairly so I'm going to show my work.

I'm also including almost enough Kailh box jades to fill the rest of the keyboard if you wish. Also including the original key caps and the extra mx blues if you want to go back to it. This combined is $98 usd. Including shipping, I think $90 is fair but I am open to offers. It's otherwise brand new.~~

Hi Mechmarket,

My name is Alpaca and I’ve been a lurker on Mechmarket for a while. I’ve decided to join my fellow cable makers and want to offer something to this lovely community which I’ve learnt so much from.

Today, I’m introducing my first **17 designs** (and many more on the way :D) inspired from the popular keycap/switch/keyboard themes in the market. My cables are carefully crafted with attention to details. Some photos of my **soldering works** can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/DJvdjWR) . All cables are reversed coiled and oven baked for a total of **120 minutes** (not including freezing and resting overnight) to produce perfectly tight and springy coiled cables.

With that being said, all cables should be treated with love and care. Just like other fellow cable makers, it really hurts for me to see our babies got strangled, twisted and pulled apart in different ways :(. With **proper usage**, coiled cables can last a long time and theoretically forever.

Please note that **the shipping cost is $5 per cable:**

|**Theme**|**Aviator**    **color**|**Coil**   **Length**  **(inches)**|**Coil OD (Inches)**|**Host Length**   **(feet)**|**Photos**|**Quantity**|**Price Without Shipping**|

So the other day I went to McDonald's to get my fix of chicken nuggets. It was peak lunchtime so it took me nearly 20 minutes to receive my order. To my surprise, my beloved curry sauce was not in the package; instead, staring at me was this oddly-coloured smoky cheese sauce (well actually it was the one-eyed Minion from Despicable Me on the packaging that was staring at me).Sorry for the rant, but I just wanna hop on the bandwagon of putting unrelated stories in r/mm posts. For what it's worth, this incident saddened me for a good 15 minutes or so. The cheese sauce turned out to be quite decent.

Shipping will be via express courier only to minimise complications given the current pandemic situation, with full insurance and tracking, 3-5 days delivery worldwide. \~25-30usd for keycaps, \~50-70usd for keyboards.

hello all, 

selling my friend's nk65v2 alu edition (which i have on hand), since he went deeper into the rabbit hole. some details:

* it was used for about 2 weeks
* stabs were clipped and relubed with 205g0 on housings/stems, dielectric grease on wires
* will come with case & cable that originally came with it
* there are signs of scratches on the plate as far as i can tell, but you cannot see it when built anyway. otherwise it is flawless

~~I am asking **$210 + shipping OBO**~~ **SOLD WITHOUT SWITCHES** For reference, the NK65 cost my friend $207 total after shipping and taxes.

Not looking to sell the switches separately at this time since I do not have smol box for them :( 

CONUS only please at this time, please comment before PM, PM is highly preferred over chat, and please include your zip code so I can estimate shipping for you.

obligatory this is restocking fairly soon at NK and the last restock lasted an hour, so please only buy if you _really_ feel strongly about getting a black alu version. thanks!",sold gmk set to /u/jynh,[US-NJ] [H] NK65v2 Alu Black w/ Switches [W] PayPal

Hey MechMarket,

I’ve got a brand new, factory sealed GMK Phosphorus 40s/Ortho (Quarks) kit that I am looking to part with. I bought this as part of a full bundle to get the base kit, but I don’t have any use for it.

I paid approximately $85 plus shipping for it, and I’d like to sell it for the same to break even.

Only shipping to CONUS at this time.

This listing is **NOT FCFS**. I will review and respond to PMs as soon as I can.

FYI, as far as I know, there is no released date for GMK Phosphorous extras from The Key.Company yet.

As usual, please comment before PM, and please do not use reddit chat.

Item | Notes | Price
:-- | :-- | :--
Matrix Noah | Black case, never built. Bought sealed but opened packaging to make sure daughterboard, USB-C connector, PCB were all fine. Planned to build this for myself but went a different direction. | ~~$550~~ **Sold!**
Tofu65 | Burgundy case, RGB/hotswap, H1s (205g0, 105 on springs). No plate in build but comes with alu plate. Couldn't get VIA to work on it and backspace doesn't work, unsure if it's a socket issue. Price reflects this. | $200
Realforce 87u | 55g, was my daily driver for over a year but I'm no longer into tenkeyless. **Two people in line for shipping.** | ~~$150~~ **Sold!**
Cooler Master Masterkeys Pro S | MX Reds, comes with DSA Dolch and stock keycaps. **I do not intend on separating this set. Please don't ask.** | $100
Ducky One Rainbow TKL | MX Browns. There was some dirt/dust that took to the caps while I kept it in storage. I gently wiped them down but didn't wanna mess with the texture. Should be fine if you do the old denture bath. | $70
Razer Blackwidow TE Stealth | Tactile ""Razer Orange"" switches. Was my first mech/gaming keyboard once upon a time, still in pretty good condition. | $30
GMK Miami Nights | Bought from someone else on here, used them for about a month but decided to go another direction. Shine on WASD. **One person in line for shipping.** | ~~$150~~ **Sold!**
Infinikey Bred | Bought sealed, mounted once, used less than two hours. **Priority goes to person bundling with Tofu65**. | ~~$125~~ **Traded!**
90x YOK Mint Pandas | Previous owner bought from Bolsa. **Two people in line for shipping.** | ~~$60~~ **Sold!**
86x Holy Mint Pandas | Bought from [same person I bought the YOK Pandas from](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/ij1172/usca_h_gmk_camping_r2_base_yok_mint_pandas_mint/). From their post, ""Sliders rails have been lubed with Tribosys 3203, and are installed with 62g TX springs, oiled with victorinox oil."" | ~~$80~~ **Sold!**
110x Unholy Pandas | Just bought to try out but doubt it'll become a daily switch for me. Great value for someone looking to upgrade from MX switches but don't wanna dive into Zeal, C3, NK, etc. | $25
79x Zealios | V2, 67g, desoldered, lubed with 3203 and TX filmed. Worked fine in a DZ65 hotswap PCB. **Two people in line for shipping**. | ~~$70~~ **Sold!**
73x **Silent** Gat Black Inks | Lubed with 205g0. | ~~$40~~ **Sold!**
69x Milky Gat Blacks | Lubed with 3203, filmed. | $35
68x NK Blueberries | Stock, came mounted in Tofu65. **One person in line for shipping**. | ~~$40~~ **Sold!**

I would also be open to trading for or straight up buying a RAMA M6. Don't care whether it's A, B, or C but **has to be in Kuro or Moon**. Prefer without switches.

Hope you're all still well and staying safe & healthy. I'm continuing my quest to finally let go of my keyboard inventory.

Item | Notes | Price
:-- | :-- | :--
RAMA M65-A | Gray cerakote, Millmax (7305) PCB, no stabs included. I bought it off [this nice guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/itdkh0/usca_h_cerakote_m65a_moon_u80a_artisans_bumens/) two weeks ago and while it's a fingerprint magnet, it's beautiful. There's a slight issue with the cerakoting (pictured) but it's not noticeable when built. PCB was band aid modded by previous owner, though they're a little worn. **Does not come in OG box.** | ~~$650 local, $700 shipped~~ **Sold!**
Tofu65 | Burgundy case, DZ65RGB hotswap PCB, alu plate, clipped & lubed (either GMK or Cherry) stabs, will also throw in a layer of stupidfish foam. There are some loose sockets, notably backspace and one of the R1 buttons next to spacebar, but I don't have a solder or spare sockets. There's also a ding on one of the corners from the previous owner, though it isn't very noticeable on the table. Price reflects ding and PCB problems. Basically, you're buying the case and getting the rest as add-ons. | ~~$125 local, $150 shipped~~ **Sold!**
**Built** Klippe T | Ultramarine case, WT60-D, Mekanisk polished brass plate, Mekanisk foam between PCB and case **but not** between the plate and PCB. Built with 67g Tealios (R2) lubed with 205g0, teal C3 stabs, plate has some patina spots. Pains me to part with this beauty but it doesn't get enough run to warrant keeping it. Comes with another unused layer of Mekanisk foam. **Does not come with GMK WoB.** | ~~$250 local, $275 shipped~~ **Sold!**
**Unbuilt** Klippe T | Ultramarine case, DZ60RGB ANSI PCB, alu plate. I plugged this in recently and mysteriously, the PCB doesn't work for me. The LEDs will all work but I can't get it to flash via QMK. Don't have the time to tinker with it more. | ~~$180 local, $200 shipped~~ **Sold!**
Drop ALT | High profile case in black, MK Ultra foam, gold plated Cherry plate mount stabs (from Zeal) lubed, clipped & band aid modded by previous owner, will come with stock Skylight (slate/gray) keycaps. Case is still in great condition, no noticeable dings or scratches. O and R keys have trouble registering sometimes but nothing like the other PCB issues I've noted in the other boards. | $180 local, $200 shipped
Planck Rev 6 | Black high profile case, comes with plate and foam. This little guy is from OLKB, **not Drop**. Just couldn't get used to ortho, cute little board though. Notable scratches on the bottom pictured. | ~~$125 local, $140 shipped~~ **Sold!**
Vortex Core | Rebuilt with lubed vintage blacks, unsure what lube or batch of switches these are but this is a funny little sleeper board. Unfortunately, the left spacebar doesn't work, rendering it hard to use because I use my left thumb for space. Everything else (including layers) works perfectly though. Unsure if it's a PCB issue or if the switch just needs to be resoldered so a few bucks off to reflect this. | ~~$50 local, $60 shipped~~ **Sold!**
Cooler Master Masterkeys Pro S | Cherry MX Reds, everything stock, comes with PMK DSA Dolch. Still a great board if you have a friend or family member who wants a mechanical or a gaming board and is okay with stock MX switches (honestly, it doesn't sound that bad but the stabs, *shudders*). Not separating these because I'm a lazy fuck, sorry. Comes with stock keycaps too. | $100 local, $125 shipped
GMK WoB | Pictured mounted on the built Klippe T. [Additional pictures for shine check here](https://imgur.com/a/MLjhFiM), I don't think there's very much shine -- you have to look for it really, though maybe my lighting is just flattering.

Happy Wednesday everybody,

I have been very active on mechmarket for the past two months after years of not buying or selling and also not touching my keyboard collection. After a few of years of some things collecting dust and two months of fun switch and layout testing, it's time to let go and thin out my inventory. Most of these were just dumb, fun purchases to try out new things and now I feel bad just letting it sit. I've priced everything to sell (please correct me if something seems high though!) and also in the hopes of tempting people to drive out to pick it up. Everything listed was bought from this subreddit unless noted otherwise. Some of the boards listed have minor problems such as loose fit or non-functioning keys but all of them function with majority of keys working. More detailed explanations are at the bottom (and also to make it easier to read instead of stuffing it all in a table) and prices reflect any problems. *Again, I will only be responding to buyers local to Los Angeles.* Comment before PM, no chats -- no comment will be ignored, as will chat. Thanks, everyone. Stay safe, healthy, and have a good one!

More info on keyboards:

* **Tofu65**: Burgundy case, RGB/hotswap, mounted with H1s (205g0 lubed, 105 on springs, Kebo films), switches are PCB mounted but will include alu plate with purchase. Switches feel somewhat loose whether they are plate or PCB-mounted, so proceed with caution if you intend to use this as a switch tester. I couldn't get VIA to work on it and the backspace doesn't work, unsure if it's a socket issue.
* **Klippe T**: R3 in Ultramarine, DZ60 RGB ANSI V2, brass plate, case **and** plate foam, stabs are lubed. I couldn't get the H key and Windows key on either side to work. I disassembled the board, dusted/cleaned the case and PCB to remove any potential dust and still had this problem. QMK worked like a charm on everything though.
* **GK64**: Stabs were clipped, lubed, and band aid modded by previous owner, mounted with Alpacas (205g0 lubed, Kebo films).
* **Vortex Core**: Resoldered with Vintage Blacks (unsure what batch), left spacebar doesn't work but everything else does. Fun board but man, relearning the layers was tough.
* **POK3R**: Resoldered with 67g Zealios R4, did a bootleg band aid mod on *some* of the stabs, emphasis on some since the board is a solder. Done mostly for acoustics.
* **Realforce 87u**: 45g, stock. Was my daily driver for over a year but I'm back on mechanical switches for now.
* **Leopold FC660M**: Gray alu case, steel plate, stock MX Clears, cable from 90N1NE. This board means a lot to me, I bought it several years ago at one of the Long Beach r/mk meetups. The cable is a throwback as it's from before 90N1NE even had a website. Comes with black blank PBT caps pictured. Still works perfectly, will probably sound great if you lube the switches or put case foam.
* **Clueboard**: 2.1 version, green alu case, stock 65g Zealios R1 (!), cable from 90N1NE. PCB is soldered in a split right shift layout. This was a dumb purchase several years ago I never used yet never got rid of for some reason. Comes with black blank DSA caps pictured as well as leftover caps and switches (i.e. what didn't fit on the board). The V1 Zealios are funny compared to what they are now but they're not bad still.

* **Noppoo Choc Mini**: MX Blues, original POM keycaps. Bought over two years ago, caps were heavily worn by previous owner but still feels pretty alright for its condition. Switches themselves are well-broken in but the board itself has been sitting for awhile now.

I would also be open to trading for or straight up buying the following items:

* **RAMA M6**: Don't care whether it's A, B, or C but **has to be** in Kuro or Moon. Prefer without switches.
* **ai03 Prism Switch Opener**: Only in black or blue grey!
* **Tactile Switches**: Experimenting with Frankenswitches so I'm looking for ~~Everglide Moyu Blacks/Dark Jades~~, ~~Everglide Oreos~~, Outemu Silent Skies, and **78g** Zilent V2s. **Only looking for stock switches right now**.

Thank you guys for all the support! Here are some updates below --

# Lubed Durock Stabilizer Set

I also received many requests for lubed Durock stabilizer set, so I'd also include lubed Durock stabilizers into this GB in case you'd like to purchase a set along w/ your sample switch pack. A standard set contains 1x 6.25u and 3x 2u, which is sufficient for a 65% board. Each set is $25 w/o sampler purchase and $22 w/ sampler.

**Note:** I'm not selling stock Durock stabilizers. You can find them on Amazon, NovelKeys, Divinikey, RingerKey and many other vendors if you want a stock set.

* **10+ new switches** are added to the list and there are **90+** **different switches** for selection now
* Stock status
   * FFF has been restocked.
   * ZealPC Aqua Zilent 62g is added to the list, so now you can order **a full ZealPC lineup**
   * Outemu Silent Sky runs out and the restock takes forever to arrive (if not lost). I don't have an ETA for it, so will delist it from this batch temporarily until the restock arrives. **For orders held off by the Outemu Silent Sky,**
      * I'll refund the switch and ship out your pack early next week if I don't receive the restock during the weekendl
      * **OR,** if you wanna try something different or get a surprise switch, just let me know\*\*.\*\* My apologies for the delay!
   * Okomochi is running low, so not all requests for it will be fulfilled.
   * NK Creams arrive late, so the orders for NK Creams may anticipate one week day although still in the 2-week shipping time window.
   * I'm not sure when Glorious Pandas will arrive since I'm not sure which batch I'm in. If lucky enough I guess I'll get them soon in the next couple of weeks.
* Shipping status
   * Most orders placed during **the weekend of 9/12 and this week** have been shipped.
* I'm working on the idea of providing switch tester base since it's being frequently requested. The following is kind of an IC, please comment below to let me know
   * **What layout would you be interested in? 2x2? 4x4? 8x8? Or something else?**
   * **What price range is acceptable for the tester base in addition to the switches?**
* New GBs
   * I've joined Original Aspiration (OA) and OpBlack switch GBs
   * I tried to get some samplers from the organizers of the GB in order to get the switches while the GB is live. But their samplers are set for their reviewers and they don't have extras to give. But I'll continue working on the upcoming GBs so that you can get something fresh even when the GB is live.

**KBD8X MKII**

Looking to sell my black KBD8X MKII that I got only a couple of months ago from the latest drop. It comes with the case itself, case foam, durock stabilizers, brass plate, and tangerine v2 switches. The switches are lubed with krytox205 g0, filmed with deskey films, and spring swapped with durock 65g springs (lubed w/ 105).

I just wanted to preface that this board was desoldered and replaced with the tangerine switches. All keys work besides the left alt key. 

As you can also see in the pictures, there are tiny scratches on the right side of the brass weight on the back of the case. It came like this from KBD. The case itself and brass plate are in great condition though.

**Selling for $420 + Shipping**

I just wanted to preface that this board was desoldered, previously had gat inks but changed it into the tangerines. While desoldering the switches, I think I accidentally lifted one of the pads for the LALT key so it’s NOT working.

**B-Stock Lilac Savage65**

Contains a dent on the back right corner of the case. Its shown in the pictures. The screws still work so you wouldn’t have to worry about clearance. Built with an FR4 plate and the PCB has mill-max sockets for hot-swapping capabilities. Has Holy Panda (Yoks) switches that was lubed by the previous owner. The #8 has a gat yellow and the enter key has a 78g Zilent V2. Also comes with durock stabilizers that are lubed. Selling just because I’m not a huge fan of tactile switches. Comes with a carrying case also.

The board is built with Tealios V2, lubed with Tribosys 3204, with lubed authentic GMK stabilizers. Split backspace. The extra propeitary PCB is included. The top and bottom piece have been cerakoted white, and the mid-piece is brass. Please note that white cerakote is prone to imperfections when looking closely, so this is not for those seeking absolute perfection in their metal boards, however I think it looks quite stunning with the brass mid-piece and the right keyset. The brass has also tarnished a bit, which is normal for brass and can be restored by you if you so choose. Does not come with original packaging. Bottom LEDs likely need to be replaced if you are interested in using them. Does NOT come with keycaps. Will be shipped securely with lots of padding.

**E6-V2** - $380

The board is built with Tealios V2, lubed with Tribosys 3204, with lubed authentic GMK stabilizers. Split backspace. The extra propeitary PCB is included. The top and bottom piece have been cerakoted white, and the mid-piece is brass. Please note that white cerakote is prone to imperfections when looking closely, so this is not for those seeking absolute perfection in their metal boards, however I think it looks quite stunning with the brass mid-piece and the right keyset. The brass has also tarnished a bit, which is normal for brass and can be restored by you if you so choose. Does not come with original packaging. Bottom LEDs likely need to be replaced if you are interested in using them. Does NOT come with keycaps. Will be shipped securely with lots of padding.

Hi All!

Selling a few things to fund some recent photography purchases. All items below are priced in USD, not including shipping - since I have no idea what it will cost to ship some of these. Everything comes with original packaging (except the GMK extra key organizers) except the Tokyo60. Thanks for looking!

Edit 1: 11:01 AM bundle has sold thanks for the interest 

Hi today for sale I have 4 S Craft Pokemon Artisans for sale. This will only be a bundle and I will not be splitting them up. Before I list my price I'd like to go over 2 that have ""flaws""

Pikachu- Pikachu has some light scratches on the top and bottom of the corners of the keycap. Not too sure how they got there but it's more than likely due to use.

Gengar- Gengar also has light scratches on the top part probably for the same reason as Pikachu.

Snorlax- There seems to be tiny scratches on the top right corner but nothing on the top middle or top left.

In terms of the light scratches from my experience if you really try to find them you'll see it at a certain angle. But if you're like me and have plans to actually use them, it really won't be a problem.

There maybe flaws on Magikarp but I was not able to find anything. Please for anyone considering purchasing I am not selling these as ""like new"" since they were actually used. Because of that I am listing them as used products and there maybe standard ""wear and tear"" on the keycaps. Again I can't stress this enough but please understand that these are used keycaps so there maybe flaws! Because of this no returns/ refunds please. I should have the original packaging Gengar, Snorlax, and Magikarp nothing for Pikachu, he'll be bubble wrapped. And everything else will be bubble wrapped as well. Thank you! 

My asking price is **$190** shipped via USPS CONUS only thank you. Reason for low price is because I had purchased the Pikachu at around 65 give or take and told the user it'd be for personal use but I'm just letting it go because it's just been sitting here after a week of using it.

~~Hello! I have two items for sale! Which I believe I priced fair and great prices compared to what I've seen trending from here and on sites such as eBay! I'll go in order and explain the boards!~~

1. ~~HHKB Type S Hybrid Black BLANK KEYCAPS Lubed With Krytox 205G- $240 SHIPPED via USPS~~

~~This is the third HHKB that I've owned! The date it was made is 2020- 04 (it's what's on the back) this has been the only HHKB that I've ever lubed so it has been opened up meaning the warranty sticker has been removed also the silencing ring on the spacebar was replaced with an o ring the ones normally used for cherry stems and such. Made the spacebar a lot quieter I'll include the original ring that it comes with but I think it sounds a lot better! I'm fairly certain if anything were to happen you may still be able to get it fixed up? Regardless if the sticker is on or not? Fujitsu has a 2 year warranty for their products Don't quote me on that, but the board has worked perfectly fine and is in amazing condition! If anything does ever happen in the future, obviously there won't be any refunds but I can provide the original receipt and such from the online purchase (directly from fujitsu, purchased in May of 2020)! It will come with the PINK WASD and Spacebar keycaps, I do apologize I am missing one of the keycaps for the fourth row where W is supposed to be. I will include the three black blank keycaps for the third row and also the original spacebar that was sent. The spacebar stabilizers were lubed with superlube. I did include a typing test video as well. I apologize the fan you hear is coming from my computer! Tried to capture it as best as I can! Will be put into it's original box, will have to provide your own batteries if you plan to use it wirelessly!~~

&#x200B;

~~2) HHKB Pro 2 Type S White spacebar stabilizers lubed with superlube- $140 SHIPPED~~

~~This is the third HHKB that I've owned, the date this was made shows up as 2016-09. Overall it is in good condition with a small exception with the top right of the board having a part dented/ chipped? I have it pictured but it isn't anything crazy. If you're looking into getting a Type S then this is a pretty good price if I do say so myself! The keycaps are the stock white/ gray blank caps that they normally ship with. Other than the stabilizers on the spacebar nothing has been modified on this board from what I'm aware of. I am the second owner of this board. I originally paid 200 for this for a local pickup via marketplace. The case seems to have slight yellowing? It's all pictured but to me it still looks pretty gray! There is also a typing test in my timestamp! Will be shipped in original box, it is beat up due to it's age, no micro usb cable so will have to provide your own!~~

So the other day I went to McDonald's to get my fix of chicken nuggets. It was peak lunchtime so it took me nearly 20 minutes to receive my order. To my surprise, my beloved curry sauce was not in the package; instead, staring at me was this oddly-coloured smoky cheese sauce (well actually it was the one-eyed Minion from Despicable Me on the packaging that was staring at me).Sorry for the rant, but I just wanna hop on the bandwagon of putting unrelated stories in r/mm posts. For what it's worth, this incident saddened me for a good 15 minutes or so. The cheese sauce turned out to be quite decent.

Edit 1: I'm pretty overwhelmed with messages, friend requests, form submissions, etc. I am not closing my services, but I do need some time to get to everyone's messages and form submissions and such! Please be patient, I will get to you as soon as I can :)

Hello everyone, this is my 2nd time posting my services! The [1st time I posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/i5mzb1/service_jintaes_free_keyboard_building_and/) which was a month ago, was EXTREMELY successful. **I built 19** ***(wewlad)*** **keyboards** for different clients across the past month or so, with more in queue. Again, thank you all for being such a kind community, I'm glad I've been able to help people build their keyboards!

***The rest of this post will be mostly copy pasted from the first one, but with updated information! Scroll all the way down if you'd like a TLDR!***

The point of me providing my services for free is so that people that possibly do not have their own soldering equipment nor the means to pay for building services can still enjoy this wonderful hobby, especially with all of the newcomers in the hobby with the sudden influx of popularity. It is also just lets me continue to do something that I enjoy doing!

**Info -**

Location: Seattle, WA. Specifically, my zip code is 98275. Please note that I am only offering my services within North America at this time, as it just wouldn't make sense for anyone outside of NA to ship to me just for these services.

For examples of building and soldering done live, or for VOD’s where you can rewatch my building process, please check out my Twitch **(**[**my Twitch channel here**](https://www.twitch.tv/jintae_)**)**.

Here are some examples of some previous soldering work I've done that I remembered to take pictures of as well as some pictures of a few personal builds. ***Please keep in mind that I have not updated these pictures from the last post, as I feel it's not necessary. I will add a list of the keyboards that I've built recently though.***

* [Some Personal Build Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/uNBBRgY)
* [Soldering Work](https://imgur.com/a/lhLfhna) (Note - If flux removal is requested, I will do so! That was not done for these as they were personal keyboard builds, and I don't care to do it to my own builds)

**Services -**

I am essentially providing all services other than switch lubing and switch modding, as I would not be able to provide those services for free, and the whole point of me doing this is to be able to provide a free service! I will however provide stabilizer lubing for free, as it is far less time consuming and won't use up a ton of my lube :)

A standard keyboard build will consist of the following -

* Soldering
* Desoldering (only if needed to solder new switches or fix other issues)
* Stabilizer lubing and tuning (default lubing will be 205g0 + dielectric grease)
* Sound dampening/acoustic tuning if requested(I have multiple materials and methods for this)
* Assembly of keyboard
* Programming of keyboard specified by the client

Here's a picture of some of the equipment I use and a list of the most important tools.

[Picture of equipment](https://imgur.com/a/gvdcxil) ***(I now have a Hakko FR-301, not pictured)***

* soldering iron - Sainsmart Pro32 (also known as TS100)
* solder - Kester 63/37 0.031"" leaded solder
* desoldering gun - Hakko FR-301
* desoldering pump - Engineer SS-02
* iFixit tool kit

**Charges (there are none kekw) -**

There are absolutely no charges unless I for some reason need to provide switches or stabilizers. I do not charge for stabilizer lubing, nor do I charge for materials used in sound dampening.

You, the client, will pay for shipping your parts to me, and then I will send an invoice for the exact amount I pay when shipping back. I do not care which shipping service you use to ship to me, however, I much prefer to ship back via UPS. I've had a much better experience using UPS to ship client keyboards back, as the price doesn't change much based on weight, and it is much more reliable than USPS. If you'd like a specific way of shipping, that is of course fine with me.

***TLDR - I am providing my services for free so that people who may not be able to pay for similar services or can't build themselves may still be able to participate in this fun hobby. I will provide most services other than switch lubing and modding. I stream all my keyboard builds on Twitch (***[***channel here***](https://www.twitch.tv/jintae_)***)!

Hello! I am looking to sell a couple boards I have, as well as a set of GMK keycaps. All prices are OBO. Details in the table below:

Item | Info | Price
:--|:--:|--:
E-White KBD67 | Flawless E-white body, solder PCB build with BSUN Holy Pandas on an aluminum plate. Great board! I am switching to a hotswap build, however, as I have had the itch lately to try out a million different switches :-) | $500 OBO
Acrylic Tofu60 | Solder DZ60 PCB, built with Zealios v2 67g on a carbon fiber plate; 60% for factor isn't for me, I am realizing, so I am moving on from this build | $270 OBO
GMK Coral | Brand new! Never mounted, and only touched by me to adjust the few caps that jostled around during shipping; only opened to confirm contents and get a first-hand look at the colors of the set. Will ship with box and trays. | $260 OBO

Thems the goods! You'll also see a PC KBD67 in the top corner of the timestamp. If you are interested in the board but would prefer the PC case over the e-white, let me know and we can talk about that as well! Additionally, if you're interested in the GMK Peaches and Cream set currently on the board in the timestamps, let me know and we can talk about that as well. :)

Prices above don't include shipping, but I usually try to be reasonable in that regard, and I don't mind splitting high shipping costs with the buyer. PM me if you are interested!

**STATUS: SOLD**

Hey MechMarket,

I’ve got a brand new, factory sealed GMK Phosphorus 40s/Ortho (Quarks) kit that I am looking to part with. I bought this as part of a full bundle to get the base kit, but I don’t have any use for it.

I paid approximately $85 plus shipping for it, and I’d like to sell it for the same to break even.

Only shipping to CONUS at this time.

This listing is **NOT FCFS**. I will review and respond to PMs as soon as I can.

FYI, as far as I know, there is no released date for GMK Phosphorous extras from The Key.Company yet.

As usual, please comment before PM, and please do not use reddit chat.

Hey all!

Looking to sell some stuff, priority still goes towards WoB Hangul but it seems like that kit is impossible to find nowadays. 

I'll ship everything out on monday, I will be using the fastest shipping method available, but I can't make any promises on ETA, as it depends on how USPS is currently doing in your area, that said, it shouldn't take more than a couple of weeks.

Only selling/trading with people who have at least a couple of confirmed trades, no fresh accounts, sorry!

[Timestamps](https://imgur.com/a/q1BUoBf)

 I'm selling my Space65. Smoothest keyboard I've ever owned but it's rarely used due to my preference for tactile switches.

What's included:

\- Space65 R1 (Gray) with red badge and original packaging and accessories

\- Carbon fiber plate with Gateron Ink Blacks, lubed with Krytox 205G0

\- Tiffany C3 stabs (full kit), also lubed with Krytox 205G0

\- Second unused PCB (tested on 10/5)

\- GMK Red Samurai (full 65% set from [Drop.com](https://drop.com/)) **PENDING**

\- Red Samurai coiled aviator cable from Luxecables **PENDING**

Only blemish I can see is a tiny nick on the left side of the case near the Tab key (pictured). Otherwise it's in fantastic shape. Prefer to sell together as I don't have another keeb with the Red Samurai bottom row layout, but will consider separating them if I get interest for the keycaps and the aviator cable as a combo.

**Asking $675 shipped or $650 local (37221) for the keyboard and extra PCB.**

Pictures: [https://photos.app.goo.gl/aMssApWCbGqzWeGv8](https://photos.app.goo.gl/aMssApWCbGqzWeGv8)

Lovely purple aluminum board. Comes with its magnetic feet.The stabilizers were lubed and bandaid modded. I later added (see time stamp) nice clicky gateron box white switches and a some random keycaps that i had lying around (didnt have a space bar keycap). You will need USB-C for it to work but other than that this keyboard should be good to go. It is hotswap-able so you can replace the box white switches.

Asking $195

2. Red inked switches - lubed 67 switches (lubed with 205g0/105 on spring and filmed with ThiccFilms) by [u/tatojang](https://www.reddit.com/u/tatojang/). Legs clipped as well so you can put these into most keyboards.

~~I am selling my rosegold kbdpad mkii that I built with Holy Pandas lubed with 3204 and pink durock stabs lubed with 205g0 and dielectric grease and I lined it with sorbothane.  I decided to sell because I realized I never use it and it is just taking up space on top of my computer not even plugged in.  I have seen these sell unbuilt for $175-200 so I figure $215 USD plus shipping isn't unreasonable.  GMK wob not included.~~ sold for asking price.

~~I am also selling the GMK Eclipse base kit, no shine and barely used for $150 USD plus shipping.  I can ship with the bandolier or in bags.~~

Finally I am selling EPBT Gok BoW base kit, opened and not used for $130 USD plus shipping.  I can ship in the box or in bags.

I have a lot of keycap sets coming so I figured I'd sell the ones I use the least.

Selling my KBDfans KBD8x mkii WKL polycarbonate board.  It is built with tealios lubed with 205g0, on a pc plate with clear durock stabs which are also lubed with 205g0.

All of the screws have been replaced with better hex head screws made of better material than the kbdfans screws and this has been burger-mounted with o-rings.

It also comes with the standard brass plate and the kbdfans case foam.

It will be shipped in the foam-lined box that it came in.

This order was delayed so long that I managed to obtain a Lin Montage while I was waiting which after building both, I prefer the montage.

EPBT Kuro Shiro not included.

Hey r/mm, 

Offloading some more stuff today, and fishing for some trades I'm looking for! CONUS for now, as shipping international is a bit of a pain, but if you're keen on making something happen we can work something out.

[~~Lin Whale (Black~~)](https://imgur.com/a/dizKd2K)|  ~~Absolutely flawless, apart from some small ano mismatching that's characteristic of all Whales. It's only been built up twice. It's currently built w/ Alpacas/Mauves (205g0 + stock 62g/65g springs + TX film) on red FR4 plate. Will desolder if we trade unbuilt boards, but I can keep the switches in if yours is built as well. Comes w/ 1-2 extra PCBs (h87a, Fave87) + 3 extra plates (half-CF, OG aluminium, PC). Comes in the original Linworks box.~~ | ~~Trades, $1500 shipped~~ Sold for $1470 
[Polaris (Rose-Gold)](https://imgur.com/a/aEDmdJN)| Standard WK layout. Brass weight shows the tiniest signs of patina; otherwise no noticeable flaws that I can see. Comes w/ a cleanly Hakko FR-301 desoldered PCB (tested, working) + half-alu plate. | $625 shipped

Hello all,

I have an unbuilt Rama Mist Thermal (caps just on for pics) in full with Solderable PCB w/Halt plate & the original “Beam” aka silver plate. This board is absolutely stunning/amazing and it sitting on the desk looks so unique but I am personally still on the hunt for a Chimera65 or a Keycult 1/60 or 1/65 as the leaf spring mount is not my cup of tea when it comes to typing on. If you are interested in the Thermal and have an interesting trade feel free to PM as I am always open to other offers & I can add PayPal on my end for any higher end trades,

Hey all!

Looking to sell some stuff, priority still goes towards WoB Hangul but it seems like that kit is impossible to find nowadays. 

I'll ship everything out on monday, I will be using the fastest shipping method available, but I can't make any promises on ETA, as it depends on how USPS is currently doing in your area, that said, it shouldn't take more than a couple of weeks.

Only selling/trading with people who have at least a couple of confirmed trades, no fresh accounts, sorry!







Item | Condition | Price
---|---|----
GMK Mizu (base + spacebar kit) | Base is not sealed but has never been mounted, spacebar kit is still factory sealed, will ship in the original tray | WoB Hangul + $300 or $500
~~GMK Hydro (Base)~~ | ~~Has seen around 4 weeks of use, white 7u spacebar has a bit of shine, all else is mint [more](https://imgur.com/fisXd4O) [pics](https://imgur.com/GqJzzD2) [here](https://imgur.com/I97cn4a), will be shipped in bags~~| ~~$200~~ SOLD for asking

Included in the package are all the accessories that originally came with the package: the red gaskets, the red and blue LED light diffusers, polished brass weight, and internal foam that I chose not to install. There is neoprene foam packed inside to reduce reverb, and the overall typing feel is still very firm, yet extremely smooth thanks to the switches.

~~A bundle for GMK WoB (the older version) and WoB Hangul and both sets are shiny, hence the price. The English alphas and spacebars are shined, and the Korean alphas are also starting to shine.

1st week GB update:

* We are currently talking to a popular streamer who wants to build our board and that should be coming out sometime this week. Hopefully this will give us a better sound test.
* We are rapidly approaching our 100 MOQ and a big thank you to all who have already purchased the board!
* The people have spoken and we have decided to **eliminate the extra charge on HHKB blockers.** We initially had thought it was going to be very low volume compared the normal top and when started seeing orders come in we realized that was not the case. The price will be changed on the website soon and all those that have ordered already will be refunded the difference ASAP.

__All shipped prices are to CONUS. Please inquire for international shipping rates.__

The recent delivery of the [Function96](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/jbd843/function96_v1_its_alive/) is pushing a few things out of the stable:

1.	~~Cannonkeys Rekt1800 Black, Unbuilt (De-built?) | This is a fantastic 1800/CP layout board. Why? It doesn’t cost a fortune, it doesn’t weigh a ton, it looks downright austere, and it sounds great due to the combination of burger mount, FR4 plate, and polyfill. I originally received this board built with Inks, and I’d advise a similar build to the buyer. However, it comes as a kit, so you can build it however you want! PCB desoldered with FR-301 and cleaned with isopropyl. During cleaning, diode D76 came off due to a cold solder on one side. I replaced it with a diode of slightly larger size (see photos). Everything tweezer tests just fine. The chassis does have a small anodizing defect on the back near the USB-C cutout. It’s a white spot, not a scratch, and I’m not sure what could have caused it. Comes with 6.25U plate, 7U plate, PCB, fasteners, polyfill, and Cannonkeys soft carrying case. Asking for $550 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

2.	~~Iris Rev3 built w/Gateron Milky Yellows, C3 stabs | Some say that split ergo isn’t done correctly without tenting, well, with this board it’s not a problem. Sandwich case with aluminum switch plate, aluminum bottom plate, and thick acrylic tenting mid-layer. Included bolts thread through the eyelets in the acrylic mid-layer, and are covered with rubber sleeves (included) to not mar your desk. Tremendous flexibility in how you choose to tent it. Switches are lubed, but I am not certain of the lubricant used. Includes some spare standoff hardware. Does not include USB or TRRS cable. Asking for $155 shipped~~ **SOLD for $150 shipped**

3.	~~Doubleshot WoB keycaps of unknown origin | Received these with a board. These are quality Cherry profile keycaps, with crisp legends and no warp on the long keys. I believe this set may be sold on Aliexpress, but I’m not sure. Coverage for ANSI 108-key and beyond, including split space and 6U (!) spacebars. Asking for $50 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

4.	~~MDA Big Bone TKL keycap kit | Tried out the MDA profile on these caps. The keycap surfaces are positively enormous and almost flat, a very very unique look for any keyboard. The legends are huge and crisp, dyesub on PBT. Coverage for ANSI TKL and any subset of that. Asking for $65 shipped~~ **SOLD for asking**

5.	**Geekeys PBT Dark Grey keycaps** | This set is of lower quality than the others in terms of the keycap finish (glossier rather than textured), but the long keys are not warped and it’s perfectly typeable. Cherry profile, with coverage for ANSI 104-key as well as Tsangan and 6U (!) bottom rows. Some shine on the caps, see photos. **Asking for $35 shipped**

6.	**Drop CTRL stock Shine-Through keycaps** | Full TKL keycap set from a Drop CTRL. No shine on the keycap surfaces. OEM profile for LED clearance, and the legends are on the north side of the switch. **Asking for $39 shipped**

---|---|---|---|---
West German Vintage MX Blacks^1 ^2 | [Album](https://postimg.cc/gallery/44t8Xpq) | D code, 1991. Some of the electronic components' legs looked sketchy so I opened a switch and, unfortunately, found out that there's some tarnishing on the copper leaves. Hence the low price. Nevertheless they feel great and could - worse comes to worst - be used as donors for stems and tops if they don't work consistently. | 75€ / Trades | 1x Available

GMK Nautilus Base + International + Spacebars, Linjär Switches x120 | [Album](https://postimg.cc/gallery/5JNfhLf) | Set these aside for a meme project that never became a thing.

Siemens FZ 6028 BTX Keyboard^2  | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/TsvAhxd) | Really cute little thing. Comes with original box (doesn't appear to have been used, but rather stashed in some sort of TV cupboard, hence there's some yellowing on one side), and some funny paperwork. BTX was some kind of Teletext protocol that came up (and flopped) in the late 80s. MX Blacks, doubleshot caps (tertiary legends are green-ish print).  | ~~75€~~ 65€ / Trades | 1x Available

If you send me a timestamp with your Grandparents or somebody else who could get actual use out of it that's not *haha lol big letter keybab on my shelf*, I'll cut you a deal for half my asking price. **Caution**: Winkey G81 boards have caps with an offset bottom row that won't work with customs, unless you specifically design one for them. | ~~75€~~ 60€ / Trades | 1x Available
Sun G81-3219HAD^2 | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/2W7xASN) | Cherry MY board that used to be paired with equipment to analyze exhaust gasses of cars. Condition is, as depicted, very authentic and fresh from the workshop. This would need a lot of love to restore. | ~~75€~~ 50€ / Trades | 1x Available

Artisans/Novelties | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/56uJihN) | Getting rid of artisans I acquired in hopes of being able to trade them for some stuff. Looking for 90€ each for the ETFs, 60€ for the Gothcap, anything else, shoot me an offer - idk what these are or how to price them. Would happily give a hefty bundle discount despite already taking a loss as is. | Trades / Paypal | **ETF Eggface V2 sold, Rest available**

&nbsp;

^1 - Vintage switches can vary in smoothness and working condition, even on the same board. Please note that I can not test every individual switch or provide an ""x out of 10"" rating of smoothness as that's highly subjective - anyone who does that is probably more interested in advertising their goods rather than trying to provide actual info.

^2 - Untested! Untested items are indeed not tested. I have no idea if they work fully or at all. Because they're not tested, y'know. If working condition is important for you, I can (depending on the item) perhaps go and try if it works.

^3 - There is contradictory information about there being something commonly called a ""Vintage Cut-Off Date"", a fixed point in time where switches suddenly stop being ""vintage""; people usually throw around the year of 1994 for that. From personal experience I and many others who are active in the vintage sector of this hobby would call this nonsense, but as it's something that apparently still sticks around and causes trouble I'll hereby let you (and the mods) know that for some people these are ""not vintage black but just mx black"" [sic]

&nbsp;

Item | Timestamp(s) | Description | Want | Availability
---|---|---|---|---
Siemens FZ 6028 BTX Keyboard^2  | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/TsvAhxd) | Really cute little thing. Comes with original box (doesn't appear to have been used, but rather stashed in some sort of TV cupboard, hence there's some yellowing on one side), and some funny paperwork. BTX was some kind of Teletext protocol that came up (and flopped) in the late 80s. MX Blacks, doubleshot caps (tertiary legends are green-ish print).  | 75€ / Trades | 1x Available
~~NIB G80-2100HDD^2~~ | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/70Htmat) | New in box. Box has some sales stickers and whatnot on it. Will ship boxed in box, so you'll get a nice box with your box, to keep it boxed if you wish. For the record, this has 1994 MX Blacks, but if you buy this to harvest, I'll find you and I'll kill you. The finding part wouldn't even be hard! | 350€ / Trades | ~~1x Available~~ **SOLD**
NIB ""OTY"" wireless G81-3xxxHAD^2 | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/1qeXSfQ) | Cherry MY board with WOB doubleshots that has been turned into... a really posh thing by a German company specializing in that. If you don't know why you'd want this, you're, uh, erm, uncultured! With this board on your desk clients and colleagues alike will know you mean business.| 100€ / Trades | 1x Available
New Vig Keys G80-LPCXX-2 | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/8oh9FOn) | New without box. This is the engraved version of a Cherry MY keyboard for visually impaired people. If you send me a timestamp with your Grandparents or somebody else who could get actual use out of it that's not *haha lol big letter keybab on my shelf*, I'll cut you a deal for half my asking price. **Caution**: Winkey G81 boards have caps with an offset bottom row that won't work with customs, unless you specifically design one for them. | 75€ / Trades | 1x Available
Sun G81-3219HAD^2 | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/2W7xASN) | Cherry MY board that used to be paired with equipment to analyze exhaust gasses of cars. Condition is, as depicted, very authentic and fresh from the workshop. This would need a lot of love to restore. | 75€ / Trades | 1x Available
~~G80-1501HAD^2~~ | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/KDFLCaV) | The infamous Arztpraxisvorzimmerkrankenkassenkartenlesegerät... board. Yellow like a piece of good cheddar, and has seen plenty of use. Uncleaned. | 30€ / Trades | ~~1x Available~~ **SOLD**
Tandon G81-1251HAD^2 | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/xsWNROK) | Neat Cherry MY board with Tandon branded 1000 series case and doubleshot caps. Uncleaned. Caps are well shiny. | 50€ / Trades | 1x Available
~~Lion G81-3224SAD^2~~ | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/287U6Qu) | Cherry MY board with dyesubs that must have seen quite a lot of use. The branding is rather rare, but not exactly spectacular. Perhaps one for completionists. Uncleaned. | 75€ / Trades | ~~1x Available~~ **SOLD**
~~G81-3000SAD^2~~ | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/BEXhgoD) | Cherry MY board with German OG Dyesubs in good condition. Uncleaned. | 75€ / Trades | ~~1x Available~~ **SOLD**
G80-3000HFD (Vintage Blue)^1 ^2 | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/zhYcglU) | Good condition of caps, switches and case alike. D code (1991) Vintage MX Blues. Uncleaned. | 75€ / Trades | 1x Available
~~Desko G80-1500HAD (Vintage Brown)^1 ^2~~ | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/tJ8aWrA) | Uncleaned. Vintage browns and fancy windowed caps. Not cleaned. Desko date codes are even weirder than Cherry's, I very much doubt this is from 1993, as the F would suggest (it has a € sign, thonk), but the switches are nice. | 75€ / Trades | ~~1x Available~~ **SOLD**
~~PCB with Vintage MX Blacks^1 ^2 ^3~~ | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/QRAVJu2) | H code (1995). Will ship on PCB, as my desoldering gun is still broken. Alpha & Numpad section are smoother than the rest, as per usual. | 35€ / Trades | ~~1x Available~~ **SOLD**
Artisans | [Album](https://imgur.com/a/O1BxZd2) | Frankly, I don't know what most of these are or what they'd be worth. There's 2 ETF and a GothCap in there. Looking for DeathCaps Bad Luck / Cross, but so are many people with heaps of cool stuff they'd trade for those, so I'd also entertain giving these to somebody for some yurops. Listed paypal price is symbolic, as I legitimately have no idea what'd be reasonable for any of these, sorry. | Trades / 666€ | Available

&nbsp;

^1 - Vintage switches can vary in smoothness and working condition, even on the same board. Please note that I can not test every individual switch or provide an ""x out of 10"" rating of smoothness as that's highly subjective - anyone who does that is probably more interested in advertising their goods rather than trying to provide actual info.

^2 - Untested! Untested items are indeed not tested. I have no idea if they work fully or at all. Because they're not tested, y'know. If working condition is important for you, I can (depending on the item) perhaps go and try if it works.

^3 - There is contradictory information about there being something commonly called a ""Vintage Cut-Off Date"", a fixed point in time where switches suddenly stop being ""vintage""; people usually throw around the year of 1994 for that. From personal experience I and many others who are active in the vintage sector of this hobby would call this nonsense, but as it's something that apparently still sticks around and causes trouble I'll hereby let you (and the mods) know that for some people these are ""not vintage black but just mx black"" [sic]

| Item | Details | Price | Available? |
|:-|:--:|:--|--:|
| ~~PC Theo60~~ | In full PC. Hotswap VIA PCB tested fully functional. Designed by Fox labs, very similar to Leaf60, but with o-ring mount instead of gasket strips, and different side profile + bottom weight. Has dedicated holes for the o-rings which feels better IMO. Comes with lubed clear durock stabs. | $375 | N |
| ~~71x Lubed, Filmed Aliaz~~ | Lubed with 3204, TX filmed, 55g Sprit Slow springs, was used on hotswap board for a month. 4x have cherry housing and deskey films because they're quieter meant for stabs. 1x 60g slow switch in mini bag for those that like heavier spacebar. | $47 | N |
| ~~GMK Red Honey~~ | Used for a few months, commonly used alphas and mod keys have some shine. Comes with tray but can ship in bags if you really want.  Don't have the banderole anymore but it was the generic GMK so nothing special. | $147 | N |






Prefer to keep it in CONUS, however if any elsewhere really want it, you must accept the risks of it being lost/damaged.

Hey everyone, I'm looking to sell a full set of never used GMK Hyperfuse Remix keycaps. I bought them  during the first preorder window with the intention of using some of the modifier keys only. I decided to wait for my current set to show some age before actually using them though. Fast Forward to now and I'm still using my current HFO set and this pandemic has me in a spot financially.

Wasn't sure on a good asking price considering this set is no longer available and mostprior listings I saw were for used or partial sets.

Hello mm, I have some things for sale as I do not need them anymore.

Tried some linears and I am not a fan so I'm letting these go.

Bought the dark base to match a future keyboard I was building but changed my mind on the color scheme.

The purple case was also going to be a project but I decided to stop so letting that go as well.

Some are from larger switch buys. Some of the items include:~~ **~~Holy Panda, Tangerine, Gateron Ink V2, Alpaca, 7 different kinds of Alps, Cherry, Gateron, Khail, NK Cream, Gazzew, Zeal, Durock~~**~~. This is a collection I've gathered over a few months. Some of them are stock. Some of them are lubed and filmed with 205g0 for linears and 3203 for tactiles.

|~~70x FFF Linears~~|~~Lubed with 205g0.~~ **~~18x~~** ~~are filmed with gasket films~~|~~$50 shipped~~|
|Dwarf Factory Black/Red X Artisan|bought from another user. Kind of a light red, almost pink color. The camera may not capture it perfectly.|$30 shipped|

I should mention I'm also looking to trade my Brutal60 R4 Burgundy ANSI for either another of the same board in black or a WKL version of the same board. Doesn't hurt to ask right?

And as indicated in the title I am interested in Tealios, either the whole switch or the stems. I'm also interested in universal 60% POM and PC plates with Tsangan layouts.

Hey :) I'm interested in trading my PC Canoe for another board. It has an aluminum plate, a little bit of neoprene foam in the bottom, module foam under the plate, and it has been mill-maxed so it's hot swappable.

Stabs are Durock lubed with Dielectric grease and 205g0

I can include the NK Creams (lubed with 205g0) that are on it in the trade to increase value if you want. Can also include keycaps but wouldn't want to trade for anything that didn't also have GMK keycaps.

I should specify a few boards I'm **not interested** in:

* Tray mounts (except a Fjell)
* KBD67 MKII
* NK65
* Discipline/other PCB boards
* Brutal/Savage boards

Prefer to match value, but if interested let me know and maybe we can add Paypal on either end to match.

~~Drop Alt High-Profile Space Grey~~| ~~Used for 4-6 months on and off as I experimented with other layouts. Stabs were **replaced with genuine cherry plate mount and lubed**. Will include original stabs as well! Foam modded with **MK.ULTRA foam** (spacebar foam area was cut so user can replace stab / relube it without taking apart the case). Just board + keycaps, **NO SWITCHES**. No issues with the board at all, I can take more detailed pictures if you want proof, but it's hard to show a **lack** of issues haha. (LEDs are brighter with translucent switches, example pics are with opaque switches) **COMES WITH ALL ORIGINAL ACCESSORIES AND CABLE IN ORIGINAL BOX**~~ | ~~$180 shipped obo~~ **SOLD TO LOCALLY FOR $160**
~~70x Lubed Gateron Black Ink V2~~ | ~~Lubed with 205g0 / spring swapped to 63.5g sprit / filmed with thicc films. LEGS ARE CLIPPED FOR USE IN DROP ALT. Will include original springs.~~| ~~$80 shipped, will **bundle with drop alt for $70**.~~ **SOLD FOR $75**
47x Stock desoldered gateron browns | No use for these, desoldered out of the planck for sale. Not sure how clean the desoldering is, so I wouldn't use in hotswap| **$10?** Free if bundled item. idk just take them off my hands lol.
~~Let's Split Ortho 40% Keyboard~~ | ~~Let's split ortho 40% kit, fully built and soldered with socketed pro-micro. This is a fun little keyboard built with Cherry Berrries (blueberry stems in cherry housings). Fun keyboard to get into split/ortho with. Also [sounds great](https://vocaroo.com/1ci1aybgYiKK) imo. Will come with both 3d printed case and acrylic standoff case, TRRS cable pictured.~~| ~~**$60?** Not really sure what it's worth since the switches are not common and the build is what took the most time. Make me an offer? **Bundle with Millmax Planck for $110 shipped!**~~ **SOLD for asking**
~~Millmax'ed Planck Lo-Pro Micro-USB~~ | ~~Desoldered this planck and resoldered millmaxes in it. Comes with 3d printed case which has rubber bumpons. PCB is fully tested and works perfectly. Will come with extra screws (don't have a use for them).~~| ~~**$60 barebones** with 2u durock stab. Priced as planck minus actual lo-pro case = $60. **Bundle with Let's Split for $110 shipped!**~~ **SOLD FOR $50 SHIPPED**
~~47-50x Lubed MX Zilents 60g~~|~~Frankenswitch mx zilents 60g lubed with 205g0. These are fantastic and dead silent. Love them to death but I don't use them much as I am home most of the time and loud sounds don't bother anyone here.~~| ~~$50 shipped, would prefer to bundle. **SOLD for $50**~~
~~GMK Camping R2 + Novelties~~| ~~Used for a couple weeks. Only [these keys](https://i.imgur.com/I5s4vZE.jpg?1) were used. No shine as far as I can tell, but they are smoothed a bit~~ | ~~**Looking for $300 shipped in original tray** or **$290 shipped in bags**. (Not looking to make a profit here, as I purchased it as extras from Novelkeys). After fees It's almost dead even.~~ **SOLD for asking**
~~GMK Fro.yo~~|~~Had plans for this set, but didn't end up following through with it. Brand new in box (BNIB).~~| ~~$250~~ ~~**$240 shipped bnib** (realized I paid $10 less than I thought, so price lowered as a result), will provide discount if shipped in bags. (Again, not profiting on this at all, just wanna sell for price I got it for).~~ **SOLD FOR $225 shipped in box**

I **heavily** prefer shipping CONUS only. But you are welcome to ask about shipping to other places.

**Bundles are heavily preferred** as well and will be given for discounts! F&F / Zelle / Venmo are encouraged if you are willing to, and I can give small discounts for those as well (completely okay with invoices, but if you wanna save some money then go for it).

I Am a Artist by Trade, My Mother has her own art studio and passed her love of all art mediums down to me. I also love building Keyboards because Lubing Switches truly is an Art Form

I have been perfecting the ART of lubing switches for a long time and through my journey, I have come to realize a few things. Tub/Bag lube makes very consistent good results but IMO I believe that the only way to truly make every switch perfect is to hand lube each by hand. It takes a lot longer but I lube every customer switch the same way that I lube Switches for my Personal Builds. I use only what I consider to be the best supplies, I test every switch in a hot swap board before I ship them out to make sure that each and every one is perfect. I do this service because I love Lubing Switches and being part of the Keyboard Community, Not to Make Money. I charge enough to replace my supplies and grow my service, That's It.

In addition to Camping Spacebar+Nov, I have a r2 base set that is with a friend currently. Also have a TON of deskmats I may be willing to negotiate with for Metaverse.

\- GMK Vaporwave ($450 + Shipping) - used very sparingly, approximately 3-4 days tops. I find myself worrying about the caps going to shine.  So I'd rather use PBT and be done with it.

\- Everglide Dark Jades lubed (SOLD locally) - tactiles are not for me.  Used for 2 days and removed right away due to preference on using linears instead. 70 pcs.

\- \*OPTION KBD67v2 MKII E-White (will sell after selling the Vaporwaves or if I get a Canoe or Space65) - Brass plate and weight, will include NK Creams (unlubed) 70 pcs.

&#x200B;

Please comment before shooting me a PM.  We can talk for bundle transaction - shoot me a PM!  Let me know as well if you need more details.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Appreciate it you guys can comment first before shootine me a PM.  Thank you!

I have an unbuilt Rama Mist Thermal (caps just on for pics) in full with Solderable PCB w/Halt plate & the original “Beam” aka silver plate. This board is absolutely stunning/amazing and it sitting on the desk looks so unique but I am personally still on the hunt for a Chimera65 or a Keycult 1/60 or 1/65 as the leaf spring mount is not my cup of tea when it comes to typing on.

Hello to my fellow keyboard lovers !

I have an OG Cherry BoW Doubleshot ABS, WKL layout set to let go of. For those unfamiliar with OG Cherry, the moulding is the same as GMK, and the colors on par with GMK 9009/Retro without the accents.

I'm looking for an HHKB Hybrid Type S to trade or sell as is.

Hello r/mechmarket!

I'm selling my Iris rev4 keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches and Gateron Black switches for the bottom keys.

The keyboard is in pristine condition.

It features two rotary encoders, RGB and full white leds backlit.  
The switches used are Cherry MX Brown and Gateron Black for the bottom keys.

The keyboard has a 3D printed white middle layer with the original Ergodox tent kit.  
The middle layer lets the RGB light through which is awesome and the Ergodox tent kit makes tenting/tilting the keyboard very easy to avoid any RSI.

The keyboard also comes with a coiled USB-C to USB cable and an audio (TRRS) cable to connect the two halves.

I'm asking 200€ for the the whole kit including Paypal fees. Shipping costs 5-30€ to Europe depending on the country. International shipping is possible too.

Looking to buy Space65 R2 white gold or stormtrooper.

Have PayPal, or in the event you're interested in a GMK set, I'm willing to trade my GMK Phosphorous base + additional top up. Because of shipping rates, it probably wouldn't make sense to trade unless you're a local (SG) buyer, but we can try to work something out.

If you don't have a Space65 but you really want the GMK Phosphorous base, my asking price is **$325, which already includes the PayPal conversion and shipping to US ($30/40)**. For local SG buyers I can do S$380 shipped. 

The base kit is unsealed but unused. I've only mounted it for pictures. No shine or any discernible damage. Spacebar looks unwarped to my newbie eyes. The pictures look darker than they actually are, the pictures were taken in bad lighting.

Please comment before PM-ing. If I don’t reply it’s because of timezone differences. Thanks for your patience!

There is no damage to this board, except for a few very minor imperfections which are barely visible unless you look very very closely. [Images](https://imgur.com/a/mQkyowk).

**CONUS only**

Board is in excellent condition, PCB has been desoldered once and tested, all functionality of the PCB is working properly. (LEDs, all keys tested)  A few micro scratches on the back of the polycarbonate case that can only be seen under harsh lighting, almost invisible in normal conditions. The board is great sounding and has a very nice RGB aesthetic, but the layout isn't for me and I have too many other boards coming, so I'm letting this one go.

via DHL air in HK. There is gonna be a $5-7 surcharge on shipping to other parts of the world. Remote charge might occur depending on your address so please pm it to me to check. Feel free to msg me about shipping in Asia because there might be discount from the courier.

The typical timeframe is 1-2 weeks, including domestic shipping to the proxy, their processing time in HK (3 days usually), time that cargos waiting for pick-up at bay and the time on flight to the destinations. It is pretty reliable since COVID-19. [Here's some DHL tracking after they pick up the package.](https://imgur.com/a/czxgagT)
