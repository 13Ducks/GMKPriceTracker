Hello all,

I’m have too many keyboards! Please buy some 😃

**SOLD** \* GMK Metropolis Base, Midnight, Signs, Blocks. 
I’m going to regret selling this, but here it is. Selling for $400 shipped via PayPal G&S for USPS shipping within the US. The box is pretty dinged up but the keycaps are in good shape and I can take off $10 if you want it shipped in bags only. 
Metropolis is supposed to run again later this year, so please understand you’re just skipping the wait by buying this original set.

**SOLD**\* Frosted Acrylic Lubrigante in Wonderland built with Zilent 78g switches. There are minor imperfections in the acrylic as depicted. It is a fantastic first Alice board and this is perfect for anyone who wants to try the layout with awesome switches without soldering. You just need keycaps and a USB-C cable to get going. I can include the Tai-Hao keycaps on the board but it really needs a different set with spacebars for an Alice layout. Asking $240 shipped via PayPal G&S for USPS shipping within the US, more if shipped elsewhere, $210 for local pickup for local Oʻahu residents only. Keycaps are $20 extra.

**SOLD** \* Alternative-Cased Shiny Clear top/Silver Metal Plate /Black Mid/Pink Bottom Mysterium built with Boba U4’s. If you want the quietest mechanical with maximum keys and a close to standard layout. this is just about it. I love the Boba feel almost as much as Zilents, and they’re even quieter than Zilents. The cutout for USB-C on this board is ridiculously small. I can include a basic Apple white C-C cable that fits the cutout for $10 extra. Asking $230 shipped via PayPal G&S for USPS shipping within the US, more if shipped elsewhere, $200 for local pickup for local Oʻahu residents only.

I’ll take off $50 if anyone is wild enough to buy both keyboards. Just reply to this thread and send me a PM if you’re interested (please, no reddit chat!) 🙂",Bought GMK Metropolis from u/Time_Doctor,"[US-HI] [H] Metropolis (Base, Midnight, Signs, Blocks), Frosted Alice-Style Lubrigante in Wonderland, Black Mysterium [W] PayPal"

Hi mm friends,

I am selling off the following items to keep myself going in the hobby and hope the price is reasonable! Please read the following rules first and as always please comment ‘pm’ here before pm, no chat please:

* Not FCFS, **bundled buyers would be prioritized and get discount**
* For the 2 keyboards, **local pick up is also prioritized with discount**
* When desoldering is mentioned below, it will be done via Hakko fr-301 cleanly
* Local is CA 95131, shipping is CONUS only for keyboards, shipping to worldwide would be fine if you pay extra shipping (for non-keyboard stuffs)
* All invoices once paid will ship the next working day

Hello mm friends,

I recently got the Aegis Navy x Jubi Keyboard via their vickrey. It is a beautiful board that I would like to keep but I realised that I have got myself too many navy boards (Navy is nice though!!) that I want to switch things up a bit. For full transparency I won the auction for a little over 1k (can provide proof in DM). Please find the details of the board below and I am only looking for trades for other interesting boards that either with a 1:1 trade or having me add PP on my side (not picky on color as long as it is not blue :D). Strongly prefer CONUS given the situation and local trade with mask also works (south bay area). As usual please comment 'pm' here before sending pm (no reddit chat pls), or comment here then contact me via discord at Jollyrogerx#9122, thanks for looking!

**This is not from the original run** 
It is from the recently released Quantrik's CAD file.
Special worth note taking: It's made by the same factory that produced the OG in China (will not be disclosed). 
Edit: from the moderator's comment, the released CAD file is different from the OG. However, I do not know the difference.

I'm looking to trade 1:1 with other 60% - TKL. Specifically interested in a Thermal, M65-B, F1-8X. But open to any other suggestions.

Detail of the build:
The dark grey Kyuu is built with Alpaca lubed 205g0, Sprit slow spring 63.5g lubed 105, Deskey filmed. C3 stabs lubed 205g2. It has a slight mark on top left brass plate (in timestamp).

Hi all! Been a while since I've posted on here took a break for keebs and looking to offload some items especially since a lot of things I've participated in group buys are gonna be shipping out in a couple of months! So here's what I have for sale today!

1. ~~GMK Hiragana and Spacebar kit! $100 SHIPPED~~ SOLD TO u/iTakakashi

~~Hiragana kit was lightly used, if anything little to no shine at all! BUT one ""defect"" it has two B keys! I used the set like this and did purchase another set from a redditor here but I ended up selling the kit that I was not using to another user. Looking to offload this hiragana kit but please keep it in mind that there are two B keys. For the spacebar kit the only one I used was the 7U spacebar I believe the blueish looking one? Everything else was just sitting there. Pricing is at $100 Shipped, as point of reference I paid $110 for the Hiragana kit and $55 for the spacebar kit!~~

~~SORRY THE REASON FOR TWO B KEYS IS THAT THERE ARE NO ""N"" KEY IT IS MISSING THIS IS HOW I RECEIVED THIS KIT~~

~~2) MILK 2% Macropad $30 SHIPPED~~ SOLD TO u/chromabolt

~~Purchased this from another user saw light use from me will include the keycaps on it and it's build with milky gateron blacks I believe they're lubed? Either way this is a hotswap so you could switch it out. This uses micro usb for the connection type. I originally paid $90 for this.~~

3) Shambles Hotswap built $80 SHIPPED

Built shambles board, purchased it from another user who originally bought off of an Esty shop. Board is milmaxxed with the layout you see. I have a layout flashed on the board but do not have the original file but if anything you'll be able to use QMK to reflash it with whatever you'd like. To do so you'll have to open up the board and short the RST PINS on the PRO Micro I believe is what it is. This uses micro USB for the connection type. I originally paid $90 for this UNBUILT. I am asking the $80 but with lubed milky gateron blacks. Also the back of the board has the protective film on it still I have not removed it also if you want to RST the board you'll need a hex screw a small one as this does not use standard screws to open!

~~4) BOB GENGAR KEYCAPS BUNDLE $100 SHIPPED~~

~~Pretty self explanatory these are BOB Gengar keycaps selling at what I believe to be a great price! These are the ""blind"" boxes that he offered in August of last year. I apologize I do not have the original cards that came with these but I can offer to show you the invoice that BOB sends when invoicing. And my apologies but no I will not split these up.~~

Everything I have for sale is shipped VIA USPS Priority Mail. My prices are what I want for the item I will cover shipping costs. So because of that this is only for CONUS!

Hey everyone, i'm looking to expand my collection of RAMA X and O's and i'm looking for a few specific caps. I know its a longshot but shooters gotta shoot, right? If you are seriously interested i will provide more detailed timestamps of the board.

Up for trade is my Deep Ocean Blue Sat 75 built with 205g0 lubed and clear TX filmed mauves on a brass plate with 205g0 lubed GMK stabs, a stock silver knob, and a blue OLED. I purchased this from the original owner and it was unbuilt so it has not seen a lot of use. The board is in amazing condition, i've been using it lightly for the past few months and there are no scratches/blemishes. All of the bumpons have been replaced with clear 3M bumpons because one of the stock ones fell off. For the trade to be considered, i am mainly looking for one or more of the following RAMA artisans/PayPal to even out the trade if needed:

\-RAMA x GMK Chocolatier X/O/Golden Ticket

\-RAMA x GMK Oasis X/O

\-RAMA x GMK Minimal X Brass

\-RAMA x GMK Monochrome Black/Dark Night X/O and Starry Night X/O

I am also looking for other RAMA Caps to purchase outright which include, but are not limited to:

\-RAMA x GMK Classic Blue X/O

\-RAMA x GMK Bleached X/O

\-RAMA x GMK Mizu Navy

\-RAMA x GMK Striker Fuji/Crimson

\-RAMA x GMK Bento Brass/Salmon

Hey everyone. Looking to trade/sell my GMK Mizu bundle today.

It includes GMK Mizu base kit, spacebars, novelties, and the tulia deskmat.  Everything is used for about a month but typed on lightly. I cannot see any shine, even with harsh lighting. More pics can be provided but i tried to get some with harsh lighting in the timestamp. Tulia mat has been used for almost a year straight, so there are a few tiny spots that will probably come out with it being cleaned off. I am looking for $450 shipped OBO or trades for RAMA X and O keycaps. SOLD for 435

I am prioritizing trades for the first couple hours for the specific caps listed below but i will sell it outright if there arent any trade offers by the end of tonight.

The Specific RAMA Caps that i am looking for are:

\-RAMA x GMK Oasis X and O

\-RAMA x GMK Monochrome X and O

\-RAMA x  GMK Chocolatier X and O

**PLEASE READ: Important information about the Satisfaction 75.** 

There are a few issues with the board. 

Most importantly, that the PCB is faulty. I pulled the pad and copper trace on the ""2"" key, which lead to both ""F1"" and ""2"" keys not working. I have tried fixing the PCB with no luck and don't have the patience to wait for R2 extras to start using the board again. I can include the PCB (with or w/o Durock stabs) or not for those that want to tinker around with it.

The other issues are cosmetic, this is a B-stock board from the extras buy on Cannonkeys and there's a small color difference between the top and bottom blocks. It's noticeable when you angle it a certain way under bright light. There are also a few small dings on the case and tarnishing on the brass components.  

Feel free to ask me questions or request additional pictures. 

Sat75 is not FCFS, will prioritize trades and Socal locals. Prices are shipped within CONUS. Not doing international at this time, sorry.

Thanks for looking!

A few months ago, I decided I really liked my aluminum KBD67 and wanted to give the Polycarbonate version a try to see which one I like better.  Of course after months of going back and forth between the two I still have no idea.  The PC goes better with more keycap sets, and the Aluminum feels more premium.  They both sound good but completely different.  No reason for me to keep holding on to both so I figured I'd let one fly.  When one goes the other is off the market.  **I'm willing to mix and match switches if you'd like the switches from the other board.**

**EVERYTHING SOLD**

~~**ai03 Equinox:**~~ **SOLD**

WKL, dark grey, gasket pcb mount, (plateless) 5mm plate-foam, extra sealed pcb, lubed alpacas v2, durock stabs.

The equinox is actually my favorite board in terms of typing experience but the bottom row doesn't work for my forty layout (i have to use the 1u key as space to make it work).
It comes with a weird ISO-layout, built with 205g0 lubed and filmed (deskeys) alpacas v2 and 205g2 lubed durock stabs. 
I can make small modifications to the layout or include extra lubed switches if you want. I can also desolder everything and keep the switches and stabs (no discount).

I am the second owner and had to import the board from US, because it's almost impossible to get an Equinox in EU (less than 30 total units sold). However, there are no flaws whatsoever except for one rounded screw in the inside (invisible from outside and now below foam).

After receiving the board i was kinda underwhelmed by it's flex. It being a plateless pcb gasket mount i was expecting a lot more flex. Most of the (stock) flex actually originates from it's rubber feet and the stock gaskets are way too hard.
So i had to experiment with custom gaskets. I ended up using 1.5mm neoprene sponge strips as gaskets and added <1mm EVA foam in the bottom to prevent the pcb hitting the bottom due to the increased flex (prevent shortage).
In combination with the custom 5mm plate-foam (cut by worldspawn) the board has a very nice sound signature and the best typing experience that i've come across so far.
I will also include the stock gaskets (don't use them tho!) and I can also include extra gasket materials if you like to experiment yourself.

It will be shipped inside a nice padded carrying case, that i've received [broken](https://i.imgur.com/X3GLbSk.jpg) from aliexpress.

~~**Sneakbox Prime_Elise:**~~ **SOLD**

I got 2 cases: frosted PC and grey aluminium. I want to keep the alu bottom half.
So you can either buy either full PC, or PC bottom + alu top (mixed).
It comes with a walnut wrist rest (a-stock) and a black (gb exclusive) rev. 2 prime_e pcb (no hotswap, no rgb).

You can choose between 2 builds:

- custom PC plate (clear), 205g0 lubed and deskeys filmed H1s (jwk linear), gmk screw-in stabs lubed with 205g2 and clipped
- custom PC plate (clear), 205g0 lubed and tx filmed tangerines 67g v2 (jwk linear), c3 tangerine stabs lubed with 205g2

I will also include a new black FR4 plate (also custom made). These can also be sold separately for very cheap as i have a bunch of them.

It also comes with custom gaskets (2mm EPDM, see timestamp), that can easily be removed if you don't like the extra flex and softer typing experience. I can also include extra gasket materials if you like to experiment yourself.

Shipped inside original sneakbox labeled packaging.

Mixed Build has priority, as i would prefer to keep the PC top.


~~**GMK Oblivion:**~~ **SOLD**

GMK Oblivion v2 Regular Base Kit + Oblivion Cadet.

I am the second owner. According to previous owner it was only mounted once and the cadet set is brand new. 
I mounted both sets and did probably around 5 typing tests in total on the equinox (a 40% keyboard). There is no shine or flaws whatsoever.

Shipped inside original GMK trays. Price is what i've paid for on r/mm.",sold GMK Oblivion to u/SweetDoom,"[EU-DE] [H] ai03 Equinox, prime_elise, GMK Oblivion v2 (+Cadet Alphas) [W] Paypal"

Hey everyone! I was fortunate enough to come across both the increasingly rare BNIB RAMA U80-A Kuro AND Milk. ~~I'm looking to keep one of them, so I'll take the one that doesn't sell first. Both come with a W01-A Internal Weight, which is in red buddle wrap.~~ I have decided to keep the Kuro!

Spring Cleaning 🧹 Keyboard edition

Hi all, looking to downsize a bit and find a trade/purchase for a Blue-grey WKL XRF (Silver’s good too)

I will hold off on my replies to purchase requests for a few hours (but please feel free to ask questions) to see if I can any trade offers for a XRF.

**CONUS ONLY** (sorry)

~~**TypeMachina x TGR Jane 1.5**
Perfect condition, slight ano mismatch as shown in the gallery. Weight is ever so slightly starting to patina. Comes with black aluminum plate, a brand new TGR Pontoporia v1.1 PCB, and a cleanly desoldered Hiney h87a 1.7.
**$1900 shipped in TX case**~~ **Traded**

~~**Iron165**~~ **SOLD** ~~(Copper/Black badges still available)~~ **SOLD**
~~Navy A-stock (or was 😅), somehow accidentally nicked the front ledge. Very small scuff, but it’s there. Comes with Tsangan brass plate, unfinished tsangan aluminum plate from SendCutSend, 2x PCBs, and extra badges (black/copper).~~
~~**$1900 shipped in Iron165 case**~~ Sold for $1720 without extra badges 

~~**Rukia R1**~~ **SOLD**
~~Case is in pristine condition, PVD brass weight has those micro hairline scratches that are inevitable with PVD surfaces. Comes with a brass plate, PC plate, FR4 plate, and a cleanly desoldered ProjectKB PCB.~~
~~**$800 shipped in foam box**~~

~~**Kei**~~ **SOLD**
~~Blue HHKB Kei, brand new unbuilt in perfect condition. Comes with aluminum plate, PC half plate, sealed PCB, oring, and the replacement screws that were sent out last month.~~ 
~~**$750 shipped in Monokei box**~~

~~**Ori CLS-1 (Ori87)**~~ **SOLD**
~~Silver WKL with stainless steel and red accents. Comes with red aluminum plate, 1x brand new PCB and 1x cleanly desolder PCB. This board as you may or may not know, didn’t have the best manufacturer. There are 2 small dents that were present prior to anodizing, one on the bottom and one on the back as shown in the gallery. One of the case screws (shown) does not sit completely flush like the rest. One of the side accent screw is a tad too short for the thread, along with 4x daughterboard screws that will need to replaced with slightly longer screws to lock in properly. 
Due to the fact that I only noticed the screw issues recently, I will need to source proper screws before shipping it out, but should be able to do so before the end of the week. You can also choose to source your own screws at a discount 😅.~~
~~**$1200 or $1150 BYOS (bring your own screws) shipped in Ori Carry case**~~

~~**Fjell R4**~~ **SOLD**
~~R4 in grey, scuffed front edge as shown in the gallery. Brass has developed a mean tarnish. Comes with a PVD brass plate and a hotswap DZ60RGB PCB.~~
**$350 shipped in Mekanisk box**

**My priority is a blue-grey/silver WKL XRF, so I will give it a few hours before I reply to purchase PMs. Priority will then be given to the order in which the PMs are received**

Thank you 🤜🏻🤛🏻",Bought GMK Jamon from u/Kistler125,"[US-CA][H] TM x TGR Jane, Iron165, Rukia, Kei, Ori CLS-1, Fjell R4 [W] WKL XRF, PayPal"
