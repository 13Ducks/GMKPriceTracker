Hey all, testing the waters. Artisans in the case will be easier for me to trade away, the AK Sirius, and Lat arrows will take some finesse for me to part with, but if the trade is good enough I'm open to it. (to save some time, i prefer to do a c/w swap with the lat arrows at this point)

I have a [wishlist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EOB6s8OmKcH1Y_7K7Qee-j3N4Ii62hdJ85jRStQupQI/edit?usp=sharing). Open to other stuff possibly (mid-high end keyboards....65%, 75%, TKL) Potentially willing to do 2:1 or 3:1 from the case for some of the easier to obtain wishlist items

Hello all,

Hope everyone is well. Looking to sell some stuff that's been accrued that I need to sell to cover my firm's short positions on GME.

**Please comment here and send message (NO CHAT)!** I will update the listing when things have sold so if you see things not moving feel free to make a lower offer but I will probably hold out for a while waiting for the requested price.

Hello all,

I’m have too many keyboards! Please buy some 😃

**SOLD** \* GMK Metropolis Base, Midnight, Signs, Blocks. 
I’m going to regret selling this, but here it is. Selling for $400 shipped via PayPal G&S for USPS shipping within the US. The box is pretty dinged up but the keycaps are in good shape and I can take off $10 if you want it shipped in bags only. 
Metropolis is supposed to run again later this year, so please understand you’re just skipping the wait by buying this original set.

**SOLD**\* Frosted Acrylic Lubrigante in Wonderland built with Zilent 78g switches. There are minor imperfections in the acrylic as depicted. It is a fantastic first Alice board and this is perfect for anyone who wants to try the layout with awesome switches without soldering. You just need keycaps and a USB-C cable to get going. I can include the Tai-Hao keycaps on the board but it really needs a different set with spacebars for an Alice layout. Asking $240 shipped via PayPal G&S for USPS shipping within the US, more if shipped elsewhere, $210 for local pickup for local Oʻahu residents only. Keycaps are $20 extra.

**SOLD** \* Alternative-Cased Shiny Clear top/Silver Metal Plate /Black Mid/Pink Bottom Mysterium built with Boba U4’s. If you want the quietest mechanical with maximum keys and a close to standard layout. this is just about it. I love the Boba feel almost as much as Zilents, and they’re even quieter than Zilents. The cutout for USB-C on this board is ridiculously small. I can include a basic Apple white C-C cable that fits the cutout for $10 extra. Asking $230 shipped via PayPal G&S for USPS shipping within the US, more if shipped elsewhere, $200 for local pickup for local Oʻahu residents only.

I’ll take off $50 if anyone is wild enough to buy both keyboards. Just reply to this thread and send me a PM if you’re interested (please, no reddit chat!) 🙂",bought gmk metropolis from u/time_doctor,"[US-HI] [H] Metropolis (Base, Midnight, Signs, Blocks), Frosted Alice-Style Lubrigante in Wonderland, Black Mysterium [W] PayPal"

* For the 2 keyboards, **local pick up is also prioritized with discount**
* When desoldering is mentioned below, it will be done via Hakko fr-301 cleanly
* Local is CA 95131, shipping is CONUS only for keyboards, shipping to worldwide would be fine if you pay extra shipping (for non-keyboard stuffs)
* All invoices once paid will ship the next working day

Hello mm friends,

I recently got the Aegis Navy x Jubi Keyboard via their vickrey. It is a beautiful board that I would like to keep but I realised that I have got myself too many navy boards (Navy is nice though!!) that I want to switch things up a bit. For full transparency I won the auction for a little over 1k (can provide proof in DM). Please find the details of the board below and I am only looking for trades for other interesting boards that either with a 1:1 trade or having me add PP on my side (not picky on color as long as it is not blue :D). Strongly prefer CONUS given the situation and local trade with mask also works (south bay area). As usual please comment 'pm' here before sending pm (no reddit chat pls), or comment here then contact me via discord at Jollyrogerx#9122, thanks for looking!

**This is not from the original run** 
It is from the recently released Quantrik's CAD file.
Special worth note taking: It's made by the same factory that produced the OG in China (will not be disclosed). 
Edit: from the moderator's comment, the released CAD file is different from the OG. However, I do not know the difference.

Hi all! Been a while since I've posted on here took a break for keebs and looking to offload some items especially since a lot of things I've participated in group buys are gonna be shipping out in a couple of months! So here's what I have for sale today!

1. ~~GMK Hiragana and Spacebar kit! $100 SHIPPED~~ SOLD TO u/iTakakashi

~~Hiragana kit was lightly used, if anything little to no shine at all! BUT one ""defect"" it has two B keys! I used the set like this and did purchase another set from a redditor here but I ended up selling the kit that I was not using to another user. Looking to offload this hiragana kit but please keep it in mind that there are two B keys. For the spacebar kit the only one I used was the 7U spacebar I believe the blueish looking one? Everything else was just sitting there. Pricing is at $100 Shipped, as point of reference I paid $110 for the Hiragana kit and $55 for the spacebar kit!~~

~~SORRY THE REASON FOR TWO B KEYS IS THAT THERE ARE NO ""N"" KEY IT IS MISSING THIS IS HOW I RECEIVED THIS KIT~~

~~2) MILK 2% Macropad $30 SHIPPED~~ SOLD TO u/chromabolt

~~Purchased this from another user saw light use from me will include the keycaps on it and it's build with milky gateron blacks I believe they're lubed? Either way this is a hotswap so you could switch it out. This uses micro usb for the connection type. I originally paid $90 for this.~~

3) Shambles Hotswap built $80 SHIPPED

Built shambles board, purchased it from another user who originally bought off of an Esty shop. Board is milmaxxed with the layout you see. I have a layout flashed on the board but do not have the original file but if anything you'll be able to use QMK to reflash it with whatever you'd like. To do so you'll have to open up the board and short the RST PINS on the PRO Micro I believe is what it is. This uses micro USB for the connection type. I originally paid $90 for this UNBUILT. I am asking the $80 but with lubed milky gateron blacks. Also the back of the board has the protective film on it still I have not removed it also if you want to RST the board you'll need a hex screw a small one as this does not use standard screws to open!

~~4) BOB GENGAR KEYCAPS BUNDLE $100 SHIPPED~~

~~Pretty self explanatory these are BOB Gengar keycaps selling at what I believe to be a great price! These are the ""blind"" boxes that he offered in August of last year. I apologize I do not have the original cards that came with these but I can offer to show you the invoice that BOB sends when invoicing. And my apologies but no I will not split these up.~~

Everything I have for sale is shipped VIA USPS Priority Mail. My prices are what I want for the item I will cover shipping costs. So because of that this is only for CONUS! As always comment first before the PM and I will NOT answer any chats only through a private message. Thank you!",sold gmk umbra base and hiragana kit to u/somuchice,"[US-CA][H] GMK Umbra Hiragana 2 B KEYS and Spacebar kit BUNDLE, Milk 2% Macropad, Shambles Hotswap built, and BOB Gengar Keycaps BUNDLE [W] PAYPAL"

[GMK First Love and RAMA](https://imgur.com/a/fcvBJF0) \- ~~Bought this set used from another user here a couple days ago. Unfortunately have to get rid of it. The set still looks great, althought there is some slight shine on the spacebar and subtle visible shine on W,A,S,D and shift keys.

All of the rest of the keycaps other than a basic 65% layout were never touched. .~~ **~~$330 Shipped in box $320 Shipped in bags.~~** **~~Base kit sold for $220.

White ePBT 7u spacebar.

I've done what I can to try and unwarp it myself to no avail many many many times. So if you have anything that definitely works I'd greatly appreciate it.

Edit: Everything but some key caps have been sold. 


Pricing is for CONUS based addresses. I am currently not looking to ship internationally due to worldwide shipping delays. Slight discounts are available if buying multiple items on this list. Priority given to quick payment and bundle purchases.

\-[The ID75](https://imgur.com/GgqhLG5) is a barebones kit – no switches or keycaps provided. The PCB, case, cable, and mounting materials are all unused. The PCB does power up when plugged in, but I have not done any further testing. Price is $120 shipped (Edit: Sold for $100 shipped)

\-[70x Healios V2 (63.5g) switches](https://imgur.com/l5fvBVe). These were mounted once by the previous owner. Nine of them were also mounted once by me. Too light for my liking, but these are smooth, quiet, and nice looking. The legs have been clipped off, so these are plate mount only. Price is $65 shipped 

\-[Ergodox EZ Glow super bundle for $350](https://imgur.com/IDsaZgO). This includes a black Ergodox EZ with RGB key lighting, a full set of HyperX black pudding keycaps, four of the six tilting legs, wrist wrests, 62g Aqua Zilents, Ergodox EZ limited edition carrying case, and the needed cables. Strongly prefer to sell this as a bundle, but individual prices for the following parts are available:

· Ergodox EZ (cables, and board only) - $230

· Tilting legs - $10

· Wrist rests - $20

· Ergodox EZ case (case only) - $50

· HyperX Pudding Caps - $15 shipped. Only what you see on the Ergodox has been mounted once; the rest have never been used. No shine on these – used for two weekends at most.

Hey everyone, i'm looking to expand my collection of RAMA X and O's and i'm looking for a few specific caps. I know its a longshot but shooters gotta shoot, right? If you are seriously interested i will provide more detailed timestamps of the board.

Up for trade is my Deep Ocean Blue Sat 75 built with 205g0 lubed and clear TX filmed mauves on a brass plate with 205g0 lubed GMK stabs, a stock silver knob, and a blue OLED. I purchased this from the original owner and it was unbuilt so it has not seen a lot of use. The board is in amazing condition, i've been using it lightly for the past few months and there are no scratches/blemishes. All of the bumpons have been replaced with clear 3M bumpons because one of the stock ones fell off. For the trade to be considered, i am mainly looking for one or more of the following RAMA artisans/PayPal to even out the trade if needed:

\-RAMA x GMK Chocolatier X/O/Golden Ticket

\-RAMA x GMK Oasis X/O

\-RAMA x GMK Minimal X Brass

\-RAMA x GMK Monochrome Black/Dark Night X/O and Starry Night X/O

I am also looking for other RAMA Caps to purchase outright which include, but are not limited to:

\-RAMA x GMK Classic Blue X/O

\-RAMA x GMK Bleached X/O

\-RAMA x GMK Mizu Navy

\-RAMA x GMK Striker Fuji/Crimson

Hey everyone. Looking to trade/sell my GMK Mizu bundle today.

It includes GMK Mizu base kit, spacebars, novelties, and the tulia deskmat.  Everything is used for about a month but typed on lightly. I cannot see any shine, even with harsh lighting. More pics can be provided but i tried to get some with harsh lighting in the timestamp. Tulia mat has been used for almost a year straight, so there are a few tiny spots that will probably come out with it being cleaned off.

Hello guys! Hope all of you are doing well!

I am looking to donate some cash from this sale to a local cat rescuer, can view her instagram at [.@fioloh](https://www.instagram.com/fioloh/?hl=en). She has been helping many stray cats/dogs (mainly cats) find homes, seek medical help (including surgeries) as well as helping to foster. I found her work really meaningful (especially because I like cats). Hence, I'll state 2 prices (just $10 difference), if you would like to help, you can opt to purchase the slightly more expensive price, it's perfectly okay if you don't want to. The donation will be publicly recorded at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asY5BAWSZ_pmxUy2jxmaSa1eHDddTiLQlEhGi1niuyw/edit#gid=1722981492), under tehbingg. I'll update here once donated. (I hope this is allowed by the mods, otherwise please let me know, I'll be willing to remove.)  Prior donations from previous sales have been made (can be seen in the spreadsheet).

All of these kits have **no shine,** and feels pretty new. I can provide more photos upon request:)

This would not be FCFS as I would like to prioritize the donation prices to help a little more.

Spring Cleaning 🧹 Keyboard edition

Hi all, looking to downsize a bit and find a trade/purchase for a Blue-grey WKL XRF (Silver’s good too)

I will hold off on my replies to purchase requests for a few hours (but please feel free to ask questions) to see if I can any trade offers for a XRF.

**CONUS ONLY** (sorry)

~~**TypeMachina x TGR Jane 1.5**
Perfect condition, slight ano mismatch as shown in the gallery. Weight is ever so slightly starting to patina. Comes with black aluminum plate, a brand new TGR Pontoporia v1.1 PCB, and a cleanly desoldered Hiney h87a 1.7.
**$1900 shipped in TX case**~~ **Traded**

~~**Iron165**~~ **SOLD** ~~(Copper/Black badges still available)~~ **SOLD**
~~Navy A-stock (or was 😅), somehow accidentally nicked the front ledge. Very small scuff, but it’s there. Comes with Tsangan brass plate, unfinished tsangan aluminum plate from SendCutSend, 2x PCBs, and extra badges (black/copper).~~
~~**$1900 shipped in Iron165 case**~~ Sold for $1720 without extra badges 

~~**Rukia R1**~~ **SOLD**
~~Case is in pristine condition, PVD brass weight has those micro hairline scratches that are inevitable with PVD surfaces. Comes with a brass plate, PC plate, FR4 plate, and a cleanly desoldered ProjectKB PCB.~~
~~**$800 shipped in foam box**~~

~~**Kei**~~ **SOLD**
~~Blue HHKB Kei, brand new unbuilt in perfect condition. Comes with aluminum plate, PC half plate, sealed PCB, oring, and the replacement screws that were sent out last month.~~ 
~~**$750 shipped in Monokei box**~~

~~**Ori CLS-1 (Ori87)**~~ **SOLD**
~~Silver WKL with stainless steel and red accents. Comes with red aluminum plate, 1x brand new PCB and 1x cleanly desolder PCB. This board as you may or may not know, didn’t have the best manufacturer. There are 2 small dents that were present prior to anodizing, one on the bottom and one on the back as shown in the gallery. One of the case screws (shown) does not sit completely flush like the rest. One of the side accent screw is a tad too short for the thread, along with 4x daughterboard screws that will need to replaced with slightly longer screws to lock in properly. 
Due to the fact that I only noticed the screw issues recently, I will need to source proper screws before shipping it out, but should be able to do so before the end of the week. You can also choose to source your own screws at a discount 😅.~~
~~**$1200 or $1150 BYOS (bring your own screws) shipped in Ori Carry case**~~

~~**Fjell R4**~~ **SOLD**
~~R4 in grey, scuffed front edge as shown in the gallery. Brass has developed a mean tarnish. Comes with a PVD brass plate and a hotswap DZ60RGB PCB.~~
**$350 shipped in Mekanisk box**

**My priority is a blue-grey/silver WKL XRF, so I will give it a few hours before I reply to purchase PMs. Priority will then be given to the order in which the PMs are received**

Hello guys! Hope all of you are doing well!

I am looking to donate some cash from this sale to a local cat rescuer, can view her instagram at [.@fioloh](https://www.instagram.com/fioloh/?hl=en). She has been helping many stray cats/dogs (mainly cats) find homes, seek medical help (including surgeries) as well as helping to foster. I found her work really meaningful (especially because I like cats). Hence, I'll state 2 prices (just $10 difference), if you would like to help, you can opt to purchase the slightly more expensive price, it's perfectly okay if you don't want to. The donation will be publicly recorded at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asY5BAWSZ_pmxUy2jxmaSa1eHDddTiLQlEhGi1niuyw/edit#gid=1722981492), under tehbingg. I'll update here once donated. (I hope this is allowed by the mods, otherwise please let me know, I'll be willing to remove.)  Prior donations from previous sales have been made (can be seen in the spreadsheet).

All of these kits have **no shine,** and feels pretty new. I can provide more photos upon request:)

This would not be FCFS as I would like to prioritize the donation prices to help a little more.

Hello guys! Hope all of you are doing well!

I am looking to donate some cash from this sale to a local cat rescuer, can view her instagram at [.@fioloh](https://www.instagram.com/fioloh/?hl=en). She has been helping many stray cats/dogs (mainly cats) find homes, seek medical help (including surgeries) as well as helping to foster. I found her work really meaningful (especially because I like cats). Hence, I'll state 2 prices (just $10 difference), if you would like to help, you can opt to purchase the slightly more expensive price, it's perfectly okay if you don't want to. The donation will be publicly recorded at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asY5BAWSZ_pmxUy2jxmaSa1eHDddTiLQlEhGi1niuyw/edit#gid=1722981492), under tehbingg. I'll update here once donated. (I hope this is allowed by the mods, otherwise please let me know, I'll be willing to remove.)  Prior donations from previous sales have been made (can be seen in the spreadsheet).

All of these kits have **no shine,** and feels pretty new. I can provide more photos upon request:)

This would not be FCFS as I would like to prioritize the donation prices to help a little more.

A few months ago, I decided I really liked my aluminum KBD67 and wanted to give the Polycarbonate version a try to see which one I like better.  Of course after months of going back and forth between the two I still have no idea.  The PC goes better with more keycap sets, and the Aluminum feels more premium.  They both sound good but completely different.  No reason for me to keep holding on to both so I figured I'd let one fly.  When one goes the other is off the market.  **I'm willing to mix and match switches if you'd like the switches from the other board.**

~~KBD67 MKII Hotswap Polycarbonate Build - Comes built with stabs (I believe these are cherry) that have been lubed with Krytox 205g0.

**EVERYTHING SOLD**

~~**ai03 Equinox:**~~ **SOLD**

WKL, dark grey, gasket pcb mount, (plateless) 5mm plate-foam, extra sealed pcb, lubed alpacas v2, durock stabs.

The equinox is actually my favorite board in terms of typing experience but the bottom row doesn't work for my forty layout (i have to use the 1u key as space to make it work).
It comes with a weird ISO-layout, built with 205g0 lubed and filmed (deskeys) alpacas v2 and 205g2 lubed durock stabs. 
I can make small modifications to the layout or include extra lubed switches if you want. I can also desolder everything and keep the switches and stabs (no discount).

I am the second owner and had to import the board from US, because it's almost impossible to get an Equinox in EU (less than 30 total units sold). However, there are no flaws whatsoever except for one rounded screw in the inside (invisible from outside and now below foam).

After receiving the board i was kinda underwhelmed by it's flex. It being a plateless pcb gasket mount i was expecting a lot more flex. Most of the (stock) flex actually originates from it's rubber feet and the stock gaskets are way too hard.
So i had to experiment with custom gaskets. I ended up using 1.5mm neoprene sponge strips as gaskets and added <1mm EVA foam in the bottom to prevent the pcb hitting the bottom due to the increased flex (prevent shortage).
In combination with the custom 5mm plate-foam (cut by worldspawn) the board has a very nice sound signature and the best typing experience that i've come across so far.
I will also include the stock gaskets (don't use them tho!) and I can also include extra gasket materials if you like to experiment yourself.

It will be shipped inside a nice padded carrying case, that i've received [broken](https://i.imgur.com/X3GLbSk.jpg) from aliexpress.

~~**Sneakbox Prime_Elise:**~~ **SOLD**

I got 2 cases: frosted PC and grey aluminium. I want to keep the alu bottom half.
So you can either buy either full PC, or PC bottom + alu top (mixed).
It comes with a walnut wrist rest (a-stock) and a black (gb exclusive) rev. 2 prime_e pcb (no hotswap, no rgb).

You can choose between 2 builds:

- custom PC plate (clear), 205g0 lubed and deskeys filmed H1s (jwk linear), gmk screw-in stabs lubed with 205g2 and clipped
- custom PC plate (clear), 205g0 lubed and tx filmed tangerines 67g v2 (jwk linear), c3 tangerine stabs lubed with 205g2

I will also include a new black FR4 plate (also custom made). These can also be sold separately for very cheap as i have a bunch of them.

It also comes with custom gaskets (2mm EPDM, see timestamp), that can easily be removed if you don't like the extra flex and softer typing experience. I can also include extra gasket materials if you like to experiment yourself.

Shipped inside original sneakbox labeled packaging.

Mixed Build has priority, as i would prefer to keep the PC top.


~~**GMK Oblivion:**~~ **SOLD**

GMK Oblivion v2 Regular Base Kit + Oblivion Cadet.

I am the second owner. According to previous owner it was only mounted once and the cadet set is brand new. 
I mounted both sets and did probably around 5 typing tests in total on the equinox (a 40% keyboard). There is no shine or flaws whatsoever.

Shipped inside original GMK trays. Price is what i've paid for on r/mm.",sold gmk oblivion to u/sweetdoom,"[EU-DE] [H] ai03 Equinox, prime_elise, GMK Oblivion v2 (+Cadet Alphas) [W] Paypal"

Spring Cleaning 🧹 Keyboard edition

Hi all, looking to downsize a bit and find a trade/purchase for a Blue-grey WKL XRF (Silver’s good too)

I will hold off on my replies to purchase requests for a few hours (but please feel free to ask questions) to see if I can any trade offers for a XRF.

**CONUS ONLY** (sorry)

~~**TypeMachina x TGR Jane 1.5**
Perfect condition, slight ano mismatch as shown in the gallery. Weight is ever so slightly starting to patina. Comes with black aluminum plate, a brand new TGR Pontoporia v1.1 PCB, and a cleanly desoldered Hiney h87a 1.7.
**$1900 shipped in TX case**~~ **Traded**

~~**Iron165**~~ **SOLD** ~~(Copper/Black badges still available)~~ **SOLD**
~~Navy A-stock (or was 😅), somehow accidentally nicked the front ledge. Very small scuff, but it’s there. Comes with Tsangan brass plate, unfinished tsangan aluminum plate from SendCutSend, 2x PCBs, and extra badges (black/copper).~~
~~**$1900 shipped in Iron165 case**~~ Sold for $1720 without extra badges 

~~**Rukia R1**~~ **SOLD**
~~Case is in pristine condition, PVD brass weight has those micro hairline scratches that are inevitable with PVD surfaces. Comes with a brass plate, PC plate, FR4 plate, and a cleanly desoldered ProjectKB PCB.~~
~~**$800 shipped in foam box**~~

~~**Kei**~~ **SOLD**
~~Blue HHKB Kei, brand new unbuilt in perfect condition. Comes with aluminum plate, PC half plate, sealed PCB, oring, and the replacement screws that were sent out last month.~~ 
~~**$750 shipped in Monokei box**~~

~~**Ori CLS-1 (Ori87)**~~ **SOLD**
~~Silver WKL with stainless steel and red accents. Comes with red aluminum plate, 1x brand new PCB and 1x cleanly desolder PCB. This board as you may or may not know, didn’t have the best manufacturer. There are 2 small dents that were present prior to anodizing, one on the bottom and one on the back as shown in the gallery. One of the case screws (shown) does not sit completely flush like the rest. One of the side accent screw is a tad too short for the thread, along with 4x daughterboard screws that will need to replaced with slightly longer screws to lock in properly. 
Due to the fact that I only noticed the screw issues recently, I will need to source proper screws before shipping it out, but should be able to do so before the end of the week. You can also choose to source your own screws at a discount 😅.~~
~~**$1200 or $1150 BYOS (bring your own screws) shipped in Ori Carry case**~~

~~**Fjell R4**~~ **SOLD**
~~R4 in grey, scuffed front edge as shown in the gallery. Brass has developed a mean tarnish. Comes with a PVD brass plate and a hotswap DZ60RGB PCB.~~
**$350 shipped in Mekanisk box**

**My priority is a blue-grey/silver WKL XRF, so I will give it a few hours before I reply to purchase PMs. Priority will then be given to the order in which the PMs are received**

**OG Cherry WoB**

Includes only the keys shown. This will fit a typical 104-key full-size, TKL, or 60% with standard winkey bottom row. Only including the non-stepped Caps Lock only. The keys came from a Cherry G81-8000HPBUS-2-C and a G80-8200HUAUS-2.

Note that the black Windows keys are pad printed. All other keys are double shot.

Also including the dark gray double shot windows keys shown, which were made by JTK - I got those out of a JTK grab bag.

These were made by Cherry, on the same tooling that is now owned by GMK (Cherry sold their double shot tooling to GMK around 2011 or 2012).

Note that the white on OG Cherry double shot WoB is a bit creamier and more beige - seems to be somewhere between CP and L9. This is a bit more beige than the bright WS1 white you see on Drop's GMK WoB.",bought gmk bleached ws2 spacebars from u/greenpylons,"[US-MA] [H] GMK Nautilus 2 Core and Spacebar, OG Cherry WoB, ePBT Royal Alpha, Black (CR) GMK 7u spacebar [W] Paypal, Local Venmo, Local Cash"

Hey everyone,

Just picked up this board from a buddy of mine who didn't like the layout and it turns out I don't like it either. Gonna be sticking with regular boards I guess.

Built with Retooled Cherry MX Blacks with 62g 16mm springs (originally built with 80g springs on the mods but I changed out those switches/springs). Board's in almost new condition, so no need to worry about that. The board will also be coming with an extra plate and pcb from PrimeKB if you want to add another build.

~~Looking for~~ **~~$550 SHIPPED, CONUS.~~** ~~Price is fair in my opinion.~~

**SOLD FOR $490 DESOLDERED**

Can also consider trade offers for TKLs or some 60s (Polaris). Thanks!

Hey everyone! I've really enjoyed this board but I need to recoup some funds so unfortunately letting it go :((

Up for sale is a Gray KBD8X MKII built with an FR4 plate, Retooled Blacks (62g 16mm TX Springs, 205g0) + an 80g Retooled Black on the spacebar, and C3 Stabs. I've actually put a 7305 socket on the spacebar since I like to experiment with spacebar sound so I can include another 62g Retooled Black in the package if you'd like. Will also include the brass plate from KBDFans. Brass plate has some dings from removing switches but not noticeable when built. The board will be shipped in a CannonKeys TKL Carrying Case for extra padding and protection :)) I can include some shelf liner if you want as well.

Case finish is as it was shipped from KBDFans, I've only owned the board for less than two weeks so no dings or dents as far as I can see. Refer to album for more pictures and reach out if you want!

Looking for **~~$330 + Shipping CONUS only.~~**  **SOLD FOR ASKING** Taking a loss on this with the extra plate, switches/lube, stabs, and carrying case. I think it's a pretty good deal :))

The board looks and sounds great, but full disclosure the side leds are shorted and I included pictures of the pcb and the leds. It comes with the original box and accessories and there are replacement leds in there that you can solder on yourself.

Stabs are gateron and plate is aluminum. Switches are Mauves lubed and filmed.

Good morning/afternoon/evening everyone! Have some items here to offload as they are just sitting on my shelf gathering dust. The GMK sets were originally bought with the intention of pairing them with certain boards, but never came to fruition

|**GMK Alter with novelites**| Sealed. Comes with the bother the ""Falter"" alphas and the alter alphas.Only selling as a bundle | SOLD FOR 420 shipped|
| ***R2 GMK Olivia++ with novelites***| Sealed. GMK Olivia was an impulse buy for me, the colors of the sets looks amazing. However, when it finally arrived, I realized i didn't have any boards I could pair the set with. Only selling as a bundle |  SOLD FOR 395 shipped  |

I've decided to waiver the shipping cost to any of my Canadian friends in celebration of the CNY.

SOLD: I have sold the Keycaps for my price, and I am now just looking for a keycap set to buy. As said, I'm still specifically looking for GMK Violet Tendencies, but there are other sets I'm interested in. Another I can think of is GMK Laser Base Kit, Delta, but I know that one is more than $180 most likely, Nautilus, or really just anything that has dark mods cause I think it would look good with my keyboard which is simply just a Drop ALT. Also, as I said earlier it doesn't have to be GMK Profile.

~~I'm looking to sell or trade my GMK Hyperfuse Base Set. I would like to sell it with the artisans shown in the picture for $180 shipped, but you can send me any offer and we can figure something out. As for GMK sets if you wanted to trade, I am looking for Violet Tendencies, but I would also be interested in many other sets, so if you want to trade, just let me know what you have. The profile doesn't have to be GMK, I'm just looking for something I'll like much more than Hyperfuse Origins.~~

**OG Cherry WoB**

Includes only the keys shown. This will fit a typical 104-key full-size, TKL, or 60% with standard winkey bottom row. Only including the non-stepped Caps Lock only. The keys came from a Cherry G81-8000HPBUS-2-C and a G80-8200HUAUS-2.

Note that the black Windows keys are pad printed. All other keys are double shot.

Also including the dark gray double shot windows keys shown, which were made by JTK - I got those out of a JTK grab bag.

These were made by Cherry, on the same tooling that is now owned by GMK (Cherry sold their double shot tooling to GMK around 2011 or 2012).

Note that the white on OG Cherry double shot WoB is a bit creamier and more beige - seems to be somewhere between CP and L9. This is a bit more beige than the bright WS1 white you see on Drop's GMK WoB.","bought extra ""b"" from gmk bleached spacebars kit from u/greenpylons","[US-MA] [H] GMK Nautilus 2 Core and Spacebar, OG Cherry WoB, ePBT Royal Alpha, Black (CR) GMK 7u spacebar [W] Paypal, Local Venmo, Local Cash"

~~Really unique keyboard designed for trading stocks and bonds. Switches are the smoothest Cherry MX Clears I have ever felt. Great stabilizers (made by GMK) and fantastic keycaps as you would expect from GMK. I don't think you can get the keycaps in this colorway other than on this keyboard. At least 6 individual profiles can be setup for different people or different uses, and can be toggled via the ""WS1 - 6"" keys. Comes with the WEY Modular Keyboard Connector Box V, keyboard connector cable, and USB cable. I'm told it's hard to find a working connector box, so I'm fortunate to have the whole package together and working (I'm actually typing this post on the keyboard and it's giving me second thoughts about selling it). Hard to let this one go, but I need to buy a new AC unit for my house before spring, so I'm slowly selling through the stuff I don't use.~~

Any alps lovers out there? This 60% BEAST is (a) heavy as \*\*\*\*, and (b) a dream to type on if you like SKCM blue Alps. I harvested these from a NOS Leading Edge that I probably should have left alive -- it was in perfect condition, purchased NOS from eBay. Unfortunately it's mini USB and not USB C. Comes with the keycaps, which are Tai Hao Dolche. I forget what PCB is in this - forgive me. It's probably one that KBDfans sells or sold in 2018.

$250 - I'll pickup the shipping. I'm pretty sure I spent that much just on the Leading Edge.

Here are some better photos from when I built this:

Edit: forgot to add that this has a custom acrylic plate that I purchased from a redditor who had  reputation for making good acrylic plates. The stabs are either from the leading edge or from an AEK or some combination of the two (can't remember).

Hello everyone!

Bought the GMK Nautilus 2 Core and Novelties sets thinking I was going to put them on a yellow keyboard...

Times have changed, preferences have changed. I still think this is a beautiful set, but I don't think I will be using this anytime soon. Don't plan on getting a black or yellow keyboard anytime soon. So it's up for sale for whoever wants it.

IF I was to split the listing into two separate items:

\-**GMK Nautilus 2 Core kit for $300 USD shipped (edit: or best offer)**

~~-GMK Nautilus 2 Novelties kit for $50 USD shipped~~ Split and Sold Novelties kit

I will update accordingly IF I decide to split based on what people want.

Hey MechMarketeers,

Corona Virus had me unemployed for a bit, need to make up the difference via some of my boards that haven't seen enough use.

&#x200B;

For trades, I'm interested in;

\- 65-100% boards

\- SA keysets

\- Everything Topre (except artisans)

&#x200B;

Prices **include shipping** CONUS! I am not shipping outside of the US at this time, sorry.

The overall sound from the board is a balanced because of mods (foam, lube, film, etc). All the treatment this board got definitely paid off. Please note that you will only fall in love with the feel of this board if you like a more airy typing experience due to the lighter spring weight.~~|~~$285~~ **SOLD**|

Mitolet - Self Explanatory, used VERY lightly. I don't see any shine anywwhere. Some damage to storage tray / box - $130 shipped obo

Keypad - SO for those of you who don't know, this keypad doesn't ACTUALLY send numpad signals by default. It sends number row. To fix this, I decided to desolder it, hand wire in a teensy. Then I added a USB C converter. notice that some switches had to be hot glued in to get them to stay. That being said, it has worked flawlessly, and offers some pretty unique functionality IMO. Will come with Original keycaps, not the ones pictured I think I have the original PCB as well, though i'm not sure if it was damaged in desoldering or not, I was never planning on reusing it. - IDK, $90 shipped? They are 70 new, but this one is programmable and has a removable cable, but its not the CLEANEST implementation...Idk. Send me an offer.
